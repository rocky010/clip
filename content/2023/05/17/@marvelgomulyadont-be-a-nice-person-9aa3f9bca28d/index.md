> “Wow she’s so nice, she always brings food to the party.”  
> “哇，她真好，她总是给派对带来食物。
> 
> “William is so nice, he always helps me out with homework.”  
> “威廉很好，他总是帮我做作业。

I’m sure these are phrases you’ve heard for nice people. Seemingly selfish acts of kindness that deserve praise.  
我相信这些是你对好人听过的短语。看似自私的善举，值得称赞。

## The Problem With Being Nice. 友善的问题。

Most nice people are merely signaling their niceness. They aren’t good people in reality, they are just great at signaling. We are so good at it that we don’t realize we do it until it’s brought to our attention.  
大多数好人只是在表达他们的好。他们在现实中不是好人，他们只是擅长发出信号。我们非常擅长它，以至于直到它引起我们的注意，我们才意识到我们这样做了。

Here is a test from the trolley problem to see where you lie. Imagine there was a train heading toward five people. On the other train track, there is one person. You are near a lever that diverts the train towards the one person and not the five… would you do it?  
这是手推车问题的测试，看看你躺在哪里。想象一下，有一列火车驶向五个人。在另一条火车轨道上，有一个人。你靠近一个杠杆，将火车转向一个人而不是五个人......你会这样做吗？

Now imagine another scenario. Imagine you are standing on a bridge next to a giant man. There is still a train heading toward five people below the bridge. You observe the man leaning over and can push him over the edge onto the train, stopping it from killing the five. Would you do it?  
现在想象一下另一个场景。想象一下，你站在一座桥上，旁边是一个巨人。桥下还有一列火车开往五个人。你看到那个人俯身，可以把他推到火车的边缘，阻止它杀死五个人。你会这样做吗？

Last scenario. Now you are a doctor and have five patients with five different organ failures. A patient comes in for a checkup and during diagnosis, you realize that his five organs are compatible with the five patients’ failed organs. You could conduct an organ transplant, effectively killing the one but saving the five. Would you do it?  
最后一个场景。现在你是一名医生，有五个病人有五种不同的器官衰竭。一个病人来检查，在诊断过程中，你意识到他的五个器官与五个病人的衰竭器官是相容的。你可以进行器官移植，有效地杀死一个，但拯救五个。你会这样做吗？

What if now the one person is your parent, brother, or best friend?  
如果现在一个人是你的父母、兄弟或最好的朋友怎么办？

The nice people would stop at the second scenario. “It feels wrong” is something they would say. This means they haven’t thought deeply about what is good.  
好人会停在第二种情况下。“感觉不对劲”是他们会说的话。这意味着他们没有深入思考什么是好的。

> **Nice people aren’t good people, they are people who are brought up in environments where nice behavior is rewarded**.  
> 好人不是好人，他们是在好行为得到奖励的环境中长大的人。

They conform to social incentives. Murder is contrarian to social incentives hence it feels wrong to us.  
它们符合社会激励。谋杀与社会激励相反，因此我们感觉不对劲。

> Ask ourselves: **Do we want to do good or have we merely conformed to what constitutes good behavior in social groups?**  
> 问问自己：我们是想做好事，还是仅仅顺应社会群体中构成良好行为的东西？

People who hold out signs saying to stop climate change are the aggressively nice types. They don’t put the engineering work to make it happen. Everyone hypes them up for being great people but in reality if they truly cared they would become an engineer. The problem is no one hypes you up as an engineer.  
那些举着阻止气候变化的标语的人是激进的好人。他们不会把工程工作放在实现它上。每个人都大肆宣传他们是伟大的人，但实际上，如果他们真的关心他们，他们就会成为一名工程师。问题是没有人把你炒作工程师。

Characteristics of people who often fall into the nice person category:  
经常属于好人类别的人的特征：

1.  High inclination to conform. 高度顺从的倾向。
2.  Strong need for social belonging.  
    对社会归属感的强烈需求。

## Be a Good Person. 做一个好人。

> **Being good means doing whatever is best for humanity.  
> 做好事意味着做对人类最好的事情。**

It means sacrificing the one for the five. Including if it was you or your best friend that has to be sacrificed. It is the path that bears the most meaning.  
这意味着为五个人牺牲一个。包括必须牺牲的是你或你最好的朋友。这是最有意义的道路。

Being good means sacrificing your humanity to benefit humanity.  
做好人意味着牺牲你的人性来造福人类。

> Being good may mean walking the path alone. Bringing up contrarian ideas. Becoming disliked by social groups. All for humanity. Then despite all that, getting no recognition for all you’ve sacrificed. Then realize that and continue to push forward anyways.  
> 做好人可能意味着独自走这条路。提出逆向的想法。被社会群体厌恶。一切为了人类。然后，尽管如此，你牺牲的一切没有得到认可。然后意识到这一点，无论如何都要继续前进。

Are we willing to throw away our humanity to benefit humanity? To put ourselves through a path worse than death? To sacrifice everything and risk not meaning anything? That is the ultimate sacrifice.  
我们愿意抛弃我们的人性来造福人类吗？让自己走上一条比死亡更糟糕的道路？牺牲一切，冒着没有任何意义的风险？这是最终的牺牲。

Research scientists and impact-driven founders are the people I look up to the most. They are willing to risk everything to progress humanity. People who know the risks, look at hell, know no one will support them, and still decide to move forward anyway. They are true heroes.  
研究科学家和影响力驱动的创始人是我最尊敬的人。他们愿意冒一切风险来推动人类进步。知道风险的人，看看地狱，知道没有人会支持他们，但仍然决定继续前进。他们是真正的英雄。

My benchmark for this is Elon Musk. He sacrificed everything. Work 100-hour work weeks, tough personality, abysmal family life. For ten years without recognition. All for humanity.  
我的基准是埃隆马斯克。他牺牲了一切。每周工作100小时，性格坚强，家庭生活糟糕。十年不被认可。一切为了人类。

Earlier I said nice people aren’t good people, they are just people who are brought up in environments where nice behavior is rewarded. Ironically now that you know this, you now have the choice.  
之前我说过好人不是好人，他们只是在好行为得到奖励的环境中长大的人。具有讽刺意味的是，既然你知道了这一点，你现在有了选择。

**Do you want to be nice, or do you want to be good?  
你想成为好人，还是你想成为好人？**
