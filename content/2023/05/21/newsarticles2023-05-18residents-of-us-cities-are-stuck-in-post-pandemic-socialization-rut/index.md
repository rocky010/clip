The sudden shutdown of schools and businesses in US cities during the Covid-19 pandemic had a host of dramatic consequences for residents as commuting and socialization patterns were upended. Those measures have had a lingering side effect, according to a new study from researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology: People are now less likely to visit parts of their home cities that are economically different.   
在 Covid-19 大流行期间，美国城市的学校和企业突然关闭，因为通勤和社交模式被颠覆，对居民产生了许多戏剧性的后果。根据麻省理工学院研究人员的一项新研究，这些措施产生了挥之不去的副作用：人们现在不太可能访问经济上不同的家乡城市。

Looking at mobile phone data from more than 1 million people in Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles and Dallas, the study’s authors tracked users from January 2019 to December 2021 to see how people in different socioeconomic classes changed where they went during the pandemic. The results showed how the diversity of urban encounters drastically declined in early 2020, as travel restrictions and other public health measures to slow the spread of the virus swept cities. But while overall mobility levels and time spent outside the home recovered as schools and businesses reopened, the researchers found that the travel habits of residents had shifted: As of late 2021, people remained less likely to engage in social exploration, which the study authors define as the likelihood of visiting a new place where they earn significantly more or less than than the general population. Instead, they just returned to familiar destinations.  
该研究的作者研究了波士顿、西雅图、洛杉矶和达拉斯 100 多万人的手机数据，跟踪了 2019 年 1 月至 2021 年 12 月的用户，以了解不同社会经济阶层的人们在大流行期间如何改变他们的去向。结果显示，随着旅行限制和其他减缓病毒传播的公共卫生措施席卷城市，2020年初城市遭遇的多样性急剧下降。但是，尽管随着学校和企业的重新开放，整体流动性水平和在家外度过的时间有所恢复，但研究人员发现，居民的旅行习惯已经发生了变化：截至 2021 年底，人们参与社会探索的可能性仍然较小，研究作者将其定义为访问他们收入明显高于或低于一般人群的新地方的可能性。相反，他们只是回到了熟悉的目的地。

“Once you decide to visit a place, do you visit a new place or do you return to places you’ve been?” said Takahiro Yabe, a postdoctoral associate at the MIT Media Lab and study co-author. “Using the data from the pandemic period, we found that people explored much less.”  
“一旦你决定访问一个地方，你是去一个新的地方，还是回到你去过的地方？”麻省理工学院媒体实验室的博士后助理、研究合著者Takahiro Yabe说。“使用大流行时期的数据，我们发现人们探索的次数要少得多。”

Yabe and his fellow researchers found that the diversity of urban encounters dropped by up to 30% during the pandemic. The recovery of mobility to pre-pandemic levels alleviated some of the loss, but the behavioral change persisted to the end of 2021. Fewer people are visiting attractions like museums, restaurants or parks that are outside their immediate mobility radius, and they’re spending less time among residents at different socioeconomic levels.   
Yabe和他的同事们发现，在大流行期间，城市遭遇的多样性下降了30%。流动性恢复到大流行前的水平减轻了部分损失，但行为变化一直持续到 2021 年底。更少的人参观博物馆、餐馆或公园等位于其直接流动半径之外的景点，他们与不同社会经济水平的居民相处的时间也越来越少。

Initially, the team was working on mapping segregation in cities and the effects of public policies, but when they began combing through data on where people were visiting and gathering, they pivoted, said co-author Esteban Moro, a research scientist at MIT’s Sociotechnical Systems Research Center.   
最初，该团队致力于绘制城市中的种族隔离和公共政策的影响，但是当他们开始梳理有关人们访问和聚集地点的数据时，他们转向了，共同作者Esteban Moro说，麻省理工学院社会技术系统研究中心的研究科学家。

“We started doing this in the middle of the pandemic, when we were locked down in our homes, and we thought: Hang on, we have never been so segregated!” Moro said in an email. “This led us to study how much of the changes in the behavior of people during and after the pandemic translated into more segregation.”  
“我们在大流行期间开始这样做，当时我们被锁在家里，我们想：等等，我们从未如此隔离过！”莫罗在一封电子邮件中说。“这促使我们研究在大流行期间和之后人们行为的变化在多大程度上转化为更多的隔离。”

To put together their conclusions, the authors used US Census Bureau data to estimate the socioeconomic status of anonymized mobile phone users, based on average incomes in their home census blocks. They combined that with phone data on the locations that people of different socioeconomic status visited, allowing them to determine which destinations in the city drew the most economically diverse crowds. Some 433,000 specific points of interest were tracked across the four cities, ranging from grocery stores and coffee shops to parks and museums.   
为了总结他们的结论，作者使用美国人口普查局的数据，根据他们家庭人口普查区的平均收入，估计匿名手机用户的社会经济地位。他们将这些数据与不同社会经济地位的人访问的地点的电话数据相结合，使他们能够确定城市中的哪些目的地吸引了经济上最多样化的人群。在四个城市追踪了大约433，000个特定的兴趣点，从杂货店和咖啡店到公园和博物馆。

The cities in the study were chosen for their wide range of political makeup, transportation mix, demographics, climate, geography and other factors. All four saw income diversity of encounters tumble, but Dallas fared the best: the Texas city lost 10% of its income diversity at the end of 2021 compared to pre-pandemic levels. In comparison, Los Angeles faced a 17% drop. Texas cities typically pursued [less-stringent public health measures](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/states-dropped-mask-mandates/story?id=76249857) during the Covid crisis, and maintained [relatively higher rates of in-person work](https://www.kastle.com/safety-wellness/getting-america-back-to-work/) than many coastal US cities — factors that could explain some of the difference, Yabe says.   
研究中的城市因其广泛的政治构成，交通组合，人口统计，气候，地理和其他因素而被选中。这四个城市的收入多样性都下降了，但达拉斯的表现最好：与大流行前的水平相比，德克萨斯州城市在 2021 年底失去了 10% 的收入多样性。相比之下，洛杉矶面临17%的下降。Yabe说，德克萨斯州城市在新冠危机期间通常采取不太严格的公共卫生措施，并且保持比许多美国沿海城市相对较高的面对面工作率——这些因素可以解释一些差异。

The results should be concerning for city leaders who are continuing to see the long-term effects of the pandemic play out in deserted downtowns, fraying social fabric and slumping transit ridership. Historically, urban areas have been valued as hubs of innovation and economic dynamism because of their ability to easily connect people from different backgrounds. If the narrowed social mobility habits of residents endure, policymakers will have to contend with an extended loss in income-diverse encounters — a trend likely to further exacerbate political polarization and diminish social capital.    
对于城市领导人来说，结果应该令人担忧，他们继续看到大流行的长期影响在荒芜的市中心上演，社会结构磨损，公交乘客量下降。从历史上看，城市地区一直被视为创新和经济活力的中心，因为它们能够轻松地将来自不同背景的人联系起来。如果居民社会流动习惯的缩小持续下去，政策制定者将不得不应对收入多样化的遭遇的长期损失——这一趋势可能会进一步加剧政治两极分化并减少社会资本。

Yabe said the research could help decision-makers get a better sense of the trade-offs as they try to strike a balance between safety and social cohesion. “These data can give you actual estimates of how much increase in policy stringency would decrease diversity by how much — that could feed into policymaking,” he said.  
Yabe说，这项研究可以帮助决策者更好地了解权衡，因为他们试图在安全和社会凝聚力之间取得平衡。“这些数据可以让你实际估计政策严格程度的增加会减少多少多样性 - 这可能会为政策制定提供信息，”他说。

There are several caveats with the study, researchers say. Since more affluent and younger people were overrepresented in the data sample, Moro said, the researchers had to adjust their results to extrapolate to the larger society. And Yabe noted that the study doesn’t look at who people are meeting when they travel, but instead focuses on the diversity of their destinations.  
研究人员说，这项研究有几个警告。莫罗说，由于数据样本中更富裕和更年轻的人比例过高，研究人员不得不调整他们的结果以推断到更大的社会。Yabe指出，这项研究并没有关注人们在旅行时会遇到谁，而是关注他们目的地的多样性。

“One thing that we’re doing right now is to answer the question of what we can do,” Yabe said. “We know that cities have become less diverse. What can we do to push that back to increase diversity?”  
“我们现在正在做的一件事是回答我们能做什么的问题，”Yabe说。“我们知道城市已经变得不那么多样化了。我们能做些什么来推动它以增加多样性？

Part of the solution may lie in improving transportation access. The team is currently looking at the impact of Boston’s two-year fare-free pilot for [three bus routes serving lower-income riders](https://www.boston.gov/news/two-year-fare-free-program-mbta-bus-routes-23-28-and-29-launches-march-1-2022). Preliminary results show that public transit can be a tool to connect different socioeconomic groups and create a more diverse city, Moro said.  
解决方案的一部分可能在于改善交通准入。该团队目前正在研究波士顿为期两年的免费票价试点对三条服务于低收入乘客的公交路线的影响。莫罗说，初步结果表明，公共交通可以成为连接不同社会经济群体并创建一个更加多样化的城市的工具。

He also has bad news for city leaders who hope this issue will fade as the pandemic recedes. At least some of the changed behaviors appear to be persistent.  
他对城市领导人也有坏消息，他们希望这个问题随着大流行的消退而消失。至少一些更改的行为似乎是持久的。

“Maybe after we realize what is happening to the diversity in our cities, we will see major changes in urban interventions, transportation, developments to alleviate this problem,” he said. “But it is going to take much more time than three years.”  
“也许在我们意识到我们城市的多样性正在发生的事情之后，我们将看到城市干预，交通和发展的重大变化，以缓解这个问题，”他说。“但这需要比三年更多的时间。
