[GPT-4](https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/i-got-to-use-openais-gpt-4-heres-why-its-a/447647) and similar technologies are making possible ideas businesses only dreamed of just a few months ago. Such dislocations in technology allow early adopters to massively outcompete those that come late. These new technologies are poised to impact the competitive landscape significantly in the near term.  
GPT-4 和类似技术正在使企业几个月前梦寐以求的想法成为可能。技术的这种错位使得早期采用者能够大大超过那些迟到的人。这些新技术有望在短期内对竞争格局产生重大影响。

Like many, I first started using ChatGPT and OpenAI's APIs in the last several months. What at first seemed like a very promising new technology in search of a use case has already completely transformed my software business and how we think about our future. In this article, I'll discuss some of the practical use cases for this new technology to supercharge your business.  
像许多人一样，我在过去的几个月里第一次开始使用ChatGPT和OpenAI的API。起初，寻找用例的新技术似乎非常有前途，现在已经彻底改变了我的软件业务以及我们对未来的看法。在本文中，我将讨论这项新技术的一些实际用例，以增强您的业务。

You don't have to be particularly sophisticated to see the potential of [Large Language Models](https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/metas-unveils-new-large-language-model-llama/446469) (LLMs), the type of model that powers ChatGPT. If you watch the news or open any social media application, you're flooded with input prompts and gimmicky use cases for this new technology. Most of the posts I've seen focus on having ChatGPT create text based on concepts it knows, mainly from web data. Ask it to write a poem, a short story, a legal document or produce code, and it does so with incredible speed and quality. Where things get even more interesting is when you start using it to analyze data that it wouldn't normally be able to access. Because everyone has access to LLMs, competitive advantage will come from a company's ability to pair it with novel data that isn't broadly available.  
您不必特别复杂就能看到大型语言模型（LLM）的潜力，LLM是支持ChatGPT的模型类型。如果您观看新闻或打开任何社交媒体应用程序，您就会被这项新技术的输入提示和花哨的用例淹没。我看到的大多数帖子都集中在让 ChatGPT 根据它所知道的概念创建文本，主要来自网络数据。要求它写一首诗，一个短篇小说，一份法律文件或制作代码，它以惊人的速度和质量做到这一点。事情变得更加有趣的是，当您开始使用它来分析通常无法访问的数据时。因为每个人都可以访问LLM，所以竞争优势将来自公司将其与无法广泛获得的新数据配对的能力。

Let's discuss two use cases that have been particularly powerful for us at Nomad Data, a software platform that allows companies to describe the data they need for a project and be connected to vendors that have it.  
让我们讨论两个对我们来说特别强大的用例Nomad Data，这是一个软件平台，允许公司描述项目所需的数据，并与拥有这些数据的供应商建立联系。

## Sales prospecting

LLMs will completely transform [sales targeting](https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/using-artificial-intelligence-in-sales-saves-time-and/320229). As an enterprise software company, we use many channels to find new clients. Social media marketing and email marketing have been two particularly useful methods for us. The way to be successful with both is pretty straightforward: Send the right message to the right group of people, preferably at the right time. From our experience, the hardest part to do well is finding that right group of people.  
LLM将彻底改变销售目标。作为一家企业软件公司，我们使用多种渠道来寻找新客户。社交媒体营销和电子邮件营销对我们来说是两种特别有用的方法。两者兼而有之的方法非常简单：向正确的人群发送正确的信息，最好是在正确的时间。根据我们的经验，最难做好的部分是找到合适的人群。

If you use email, for example, most list-building services allow you to filter business contacts by company size, title, industry and other high-level metrics. For some industries, this is enough. At my company, our issue is that we target broad roles such as Data Scientist or Data Engineer. Ninety-five percent of data scientists are not the right target for us, but since filtering is done at the title level, this is the best we can do. The same lists of targets are then used for [social media targeting](https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/5-essentials-for-connecting-with-your-ideal-target-market/287192), leaving us with the same issue.  
例如，如果您使用电子邮件，大多数列表构建服务都允许您按公司规模、职务、行业和其他高级指标过滤业务联系人。对于某些行业来说，这就足够了。在我的公司，我们的问题是我们针对广泛的角色，如数据科学家或数据工程师。百分之九十五的数据科学家不是我们的正确目标，但由于过滤是在标题级别完成的，这是我们能做的最好的事情。然后将相同的目标列表用于 社交媒体定位 ，给我们留下了同样的问题。

LLMs present a completely new opportunity for targeting. If I were to look at a data scientist's social media profile, I can quickly tell if they are actually a good target for our software. If I had the time and patience to do this with every data scientist's profile, I could come up with an amazing target list, massively accelerating the speed at which I can get my message to the right people. In turn, I'd be dramatically reducing my [marketing costs](https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-maximize-your-marketing-budget-in-2023/442470) since I wouldn't market to anyone outside of my focus area.  
LLM为定位提供了一个全新的机会。如果我查看数据科学家的社交媒体资料，我可以快速判断他们是否真的是我们软件的良好目标。如果我有时间和耐心对每个数据科学家的个人资料进行此操作，我可以想出一个惊人的目标列表，大大加快我将信息传达给合适人的速度。反过来，我将大大降低我的营销成本，因为我不会向我关注领域以外的任何人推销。

LLMs allow you to do just this — and at scale. You can feed in a profile and teach the LLM what about that profile makes it a good or bad fit. You can do this thousands or millions of times to produce the perfect lead list. The next question is always, "Well, where can I get this data?" This is a common dataset that you can find online or through our data discovery service at Nomad Data and purchase.  
LLM允许你做到这一点 - 而且是大规模的。您可以输入个人资料并教LLM该个人资料如何使其适合或不适合。您可以执行此操作数千或数百万次以生成完美的潜在客户列表。下一个问题总是，“那么，我在哪里可以获得这些数据？这是一个常见的数据集，您可以在线或通过我们的数据发现服务找到 Nomad Data 并购买。

## Data entry

Data entry is a common problem for most businesses. You have a large volume of data you need transformed to make it more usable. This might be removing pricing data from a large set of contracts, or it might be removing key pieces of information from a long product description. Common solutions to this previously were to hire armies of people to go through the data one piece at a time and enter the new information into another system. Another novel solution was to use a service like Amazon Mechanical Turk to essentially outsource these small tasks to thousands of people, paying a small amount per completed task. With LLMs, you can now automate this process, transforming data at a pace that just wasn't possible with human intervention.  
数据输入是大多数企业的常见问题。您需要转换大量数据以使其更易于使用。这可能是从大量合同中删除定价数据，也可能是从长产品描述中删除关键信息。以前，对此的常见解决方案是雇用大量人员一次浏览数据，然后将新信息输入另一个系统。另一个新颖的解决方案是使用像Amazon Mechanical Turk这样的服务将这些小任务外包给成千上万的人，每完成一项任务支付少量费用。使用 LLM，您现在可以自动执行此过程，以人工干预无法实现的速度转换数据。

At my company, we're using this approach to perform many different tasks. One such task is to improve the profiles of vendors participating in our marketplace. Because we have thousands of partners, it wasn't feasible to improve each vendor's profile by hand and ensure the quality was up to our standards. With LLMs, we can train the model to understand what makes a profile good or bad, and then in seconds, it can let us know which ones aren't up to par. It can even produce useful feedback which we can share with the vendors to help them improve their profiles.  
在我的公司，我们使用这种方法来执行许多不同的任务。其中一项任务是改善参与我们市场的供应商的概况。由于我们有成千上万的合作伙伴，因此手动改善每个供应商的概况并确保质量符合我们的标准是不可行的。使用LLM，我们可以训练模型以了解是什么使配置文件好或坏，然后在几秒钟内，它可以让我们知道哪些配置文件不符合标准。它甚至可以产生有用的反馈，我们可以与供应商分享，以帮助他们改善个人资料。

We're also in the process of adding similar functionality within our application that allows users to input free-form text. We can use this approach to ensure the quality of what is being inputted is sufficient without any manual intervention.  
我们还在应用程序中添加类似的功能，允许用户输入自由格式的文本。我们可以使用这种方法来确保输入内容的质量足够，而无需任何人工干预。

## Create a competitive advantage before you fall behind  
在落后之前创造竞争优势

These are a few of the simpler use cases we've come up with for LLMs that all rely primarily on data that your company possesses or can acquire. We have many more we are researching that are even more transformative.  
这些是我们为LLM提出的一些更简单的用例，这些用例主要依赖于贵公司拥有或可以获取的数据。我们正在研究的还有更多更具变革性的研究。

The most interesting use cases involve inputting unique data with very detailed sets of instructions on what task the AI should perform. These instructions get built into the prompts, which with GPT-4 can be quite long, allowing for a significant [competitive advantage](https://www.entrepreneur.com/science-technology/how-small-businesses-can-leverage-ai-to-battle-bigger/352867) to be derived from using them well. On our data discovery platform, we have already seen an increase in demand driven by clients looking for data to power these types of models.  
最有趣的用例涉及输入独特的数据，其中包含有关AI应执行的任务的非常详细的指令集。这些指令内置于提示中，使用 GPT-4 可能会很长，从而可以通过很好地使用它们获得显着的竞争优势。在我们的数据发现平台上，我们已经看到客户寻求数据来支持这些类型的模型所推动的需求增加。

Throughout my career, I've never seen a technology have such a profound impact in such a short period of time. Inventions like the semiconductor, cell phones and the internet took well over a decade to start having a material impact. This pace allowed businesses to prepare for the coming change. LLMs are going to completely change the art of the possible, and not in decades, but in months. Finding ways to create an advantage by using them is going to be essential to maintain competitiveness.
