## **I Feel Bad About My Neck  
我觉得我的脖子不好  
**

## by Nora Ephron (2006) 诺拉·艾芙隆 (2006)

Perhaps better known for her screenwriting (_Silkwood_, _[When Harry Met Sally](https://www.theguardian.com/film/when-harry-met-sally)_, _Heartburn_), Ephron’s brand of smart theatrical humour is on best display in her essays. Confiding and self-deprecating, she has a way of always managing to sound like your best friend – even when writing about her apartment on New York’s Upper West Side. This wildly enjoyable collection includes her droll observations about ageing, vanity – and a scorching appraisal of Bill Clinton.

也许更出名的是她的编剧（Silkwood、When Harry Met Sally、Heartburn），Ephron 聪明的戏剧幽默品牌在她的文章中得到了最好的展示。她既自信又自嘲，总是设法让自己听起来像你最好的朋友——即使是在写她在纽约上西区的公寓时也是如此。这本非常有趣的合集包括她对衰老、虚荣心的滑稽观察，以及对比尔克林顿的尖锐评价。

## **Broken Glass 碎玻璃**

## by Alain Mabanckou (2005), translated by Helen Stevenson (2009)  
作者：Alain Mabanckou (2005)，海伦·史蒂文森 (Helen Stevenson) 译 (2009)  

The Congolese writer says he was “trying to break the French language” with _Broken Glass_ – a black comedy told by a disgraced teacher without much in the way of full stops or paragraph breaks. As Mabanckou’s unreliable narrator munches his “bicycle chicken” and drinks his red wine, it becomes clear he has the history of [Congo-Brazzaville](https://www.theguardian.com/world/congo-brazzaville) and the whole of French literature in his sights.

这位刚果作家说，他正在用《破碎的玻璃》“试图打破法语”——一部黑色喜剧，由一位名誉扫地的老师讲述，没有太多的句号或段落中断。当 Mabanckou 的不可靠的叙述者嚼着他的“自行车鸡”并喝着他的红酒时，很明显他已经将刚果 - 布拉柴维尔的历史和整个法国文学纳入了他的视野。

龙纹身的女孩  

Radical journalist Mikael Blomkvist forms an unlikely alliance with troubled young hacker Lisbeth Salander as they follow a trail of murder and malfeasance connected with one of Sweden’s most powerful families in the first novel of the bestselling Millennium trilogy. The high-level intrigue beguiled millions of readers, brought “Scandi noir” to prominence and inspired innumerable copycats.

激进的记者 Mikael Blomkvist 与陷入困境的年轻黑客 Lisbeth Salander 结成了不太可能的联盟，因为他们在畅销的千年三部曲的第一部小说中追踪与瑞典最有权势的家族之一有关的谋杀和渎职行为。高层次的阴谋迷惑了数百万读者，使“黑色斯堪的纳维亚”声名鹊起，并激发了无数模仿者。

## **Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  
哈利·波特与火焰杯  
**

## by JK Rowling (2000) JK 罗琳 (2000)

A generation grew up on Rowling’s all-conquering magical fantasies, but countless adults have also been enthralled by her immersive world. Book four, the first of the doorstoppers, marks the point where the series really takes off. The Triwizard Tournament provides pace and tension, and Rowling makes her boy wizard look death in the eye for the first time.

一代人是在罗琳无所不能的魔法幻想中长大的，但无数成年人也被她身临其境的世界所吸引。第四本书，第一个门挡，标志着该系列真正起飞的时刻。三强争霸赛提供了节奏和紧张感，罗琳让她的男巫第一次直面死亡。

## **A Little Life 小生活**

## by Hanya Yanagihara (2015) 柳原羽也 (2015)

This operatically harrowing American gay melodrama became an unlikely bestseller, and one of the most divisive novels of the century so far. One man’s life is blighted by abuse and its aftermath, but also illuminated by love and friendship. Some readers wept all night, some condemned it as titillating and exploitative, but no one could deny its power.

这部歌剧般悲惨的美国同性恋情节剧出人意料地成为畅销书，并且成为本世纪迄今为止最具争议的小说之一。一个人的生活被虐待及其后果所毁坏，但也被爱和友谊照亮。一些读者哭了一整夜，一些人谴责它是挑逗和剥削，但没有人能否认它的力量。

## **Chronicles: Volume One 编年史：第一卷**

## by Bob Dylan (2004) 鲍勃·迪伦 (2004)

Dylan’s reticence about his personal life is a central part of the singer-songwriter’s brand, so the gaps and omissions in this memoir come as no surprise. The result is both sharp and dreamy, sliding in and out of different phases of Dylan’s career but rooted in his earliest days as a Woody Guthrie wannabe in New York City. Fans are still waiting for volume two.

迪伦对个人生活的沉默是这位创作型歌手品牌的核心部分，因此这本回忆录中的空白和遗漏也就不足为奇了。结果既尖锐又梦幻，在迪伦职业生涯的不同阶段滑进滑出，但植根于他早年在纽约市作为伍迪格思里崇拜者的日子。粉丝们仍在等待第二卷。

## **The Tipping Point 引爆点**

## by Malcolm Gladwell (2000) 马尔科姆·格拉德威尔 (2000)

The New Yorker staff writer examines phenomena from shoe sales to crime rates through the lens of epidemiology, reaching his own tipping point, when he became a rock-star intellectual and unleashed a wave of quirky studies of contemporary society. Two decades on, Gladwell is often accused of oversimplification and cherry picking, but his idiosyncratic bestsellers have helped shape 21st-century culture.

这位《纽约客》特约撰稿人通过流行病学的视角审视从鞋子销售到犯罪率的各种现象，达到了他自己的转折点，当时他成为了一名摇滚明星知识分子，并掀起了一股对当代社会的古怪研究浪潮。二十年过去了，格拉德威尔经常被指责过于简单化和采摘樱桃，但他那些与众不同的畅销书帮助塑造了 21 世纪的文化。

## **Darkmans 黑暗人**

## by Nicola Barker (2007) 尼古拉·巴克 (2007)

British fiction’s most anarchic author is as prolific as she is playful, but this freewheeling, visionary epic set around the Thames Gateway is her magnum opus. Barker brings her customary linguistic invention and wild humour to a tale about history’s hold on the present, as contemporary Ashford is haunted by the spirit of a medieval jester.

英国小说中最无政府主义的作家既多产又顽皮，但这部以泰晤士河口为背景的随心所欲、富有远见的史诗是她的代表作。巴克将她惯用的语言发明和狂野幽默带到了一个关于历史对现在的把握的故事中，因为当代阿什福德被中世纪小丑的精神所困扰。

One of the most underrated prose writers demonstrates the literary firepower of science fiction at its best. Three narrative strands – spanning far-future space opera, contemporary unease and virtual-reality pastiche – are braided together for a breathtaking metaphysical voyage in pursuit of the mystery at the heart of reality.

最被低估的散文作家之一充分展示了科幻小说的文学火力。三个叙事主线——跨越遥远未来的太空歌剧、当代的不安和虚拟现实的模仿——交织在一起，展开一场令人叹为观止的形而上学之旅，追寻现实核心的奥秘。

A grand house by a lake in the east of Germany is both the setting and main character of Erpenbeck’s third novel. The turbulent waves of 20th-century history crash over it as the house is sold by a Jewish family fleeing the Third Reich, requisitioned by the Russian army, reclaimed by exiles returning from Siberia, and sold again.

德国东部湖边的一座豪宅既是埃彭贝克第三部小说的背景，也是主人公。这座房子被一个逃离第三帝国的犹太家庭出售，被俄罗斯军队征用，被从西伯利亚返回的流亡者收回，并再次出售，20 世纪历史的汹涌波涛席卷了它。

## **Noughts** **& Crosses** 零和十字架

## by Malorie Blackman (2001) 马洛里·布莱克曼 (2001)

Set in an alternative Britain, this groundbreaking piece of young adult fiction sees black people, called the Crosses, hold all the power and influence, while the noughts – white people – are marginalised and segregated. The former children’s laureate’s series is a crucial work for explaining racism to young readers.

这部开创性的年轻成人小说以另类英国为背景，黑人被称为“十字架”，掌握着所有的权力和影响力，而无能者——白人——则被边缘化和隔离。这位前儿童文学奖得主的系列作品是向年轻读者解释种族主义的重要作品。

This may not be the only account of living in a religious household in the American [midwest](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/10/top-10-books-set-in-the-american-midwest) (in her youth, the author joined a group called God’s Gang, where they spoke in tongues), but it is surely the funniest. The author started out as the “poet laureate of Twitter”; her language is brilliant, and she has a completely original mind.

这可能不是唯一一个生活在美国中西部宗教家庭的故事（在她年轻的时候，作者加入了一个叫做上帝帮的团体，在那里他们说方言），但它肯定是最有趣的。作者最初是“推特的桂冠诗人”；她的语言很精彩，她有一个完全独创的思想。

This memoir by the leather-jacketed economist of the six months he spent as Greece’s finance minister in 2015 at a time of economic and political crisis has been described as “one of the best political memoirs ever written”. He comes up against the IMF, the European institutions, Wall Street, billionaires and media owners and is told how the system works – as a result, his book is a telling description of modern power.

这位穿着皮夹克的经济学家在 2015 年经济和政治危机时期担任希腊财政部长六个月的回忆录被描述为“有史以来最好的政治回忆录之一”。他遇到了国际货币基金组织、欧洲机构、华尔街、亿万富翁和媒体所有者，并被告知该系统是如何运作的——因此，他的书是对现代权力的生动描述。

## **The God Delusion 上帝的错觉**

## by Richard Dawkins (2006) 理查德·道金斯 (2006)

A key text in the days when the “New Atheism” was much talked about, _The God Delusion_ is a hard-hitting attack on religion, full of Dawkins’s confidence that faith produces fanatics and all arguments for God are ridiculous. What the evolutionary biologist lacks in philosophical sophistication, he makes up for in passion, and the book sold in huge numbers.

《上帝的错觉》是“新无神论”盛行时期的重要文本，是对宗教的强硬攻击，充满了道金斯的信心，即信仰产生狂热分子，所有支持上帝的论点都是荒谬的。这位进化生物学家在哲学的成熟度上有所欠缺，但他用热情弥补了这一点，这本书销量巨大。

## **Harvest 收成**

## by Jim Crace (2013) 吉姆·克瑞斯 (2013)

Crace is fascinated by the moment when one era gives way to another. Here, it is the enclosure of the commons, a fulcrum of English history, that drives his story of dispossession and displacement. Set in a village without a name, the narrative dramatises what it’s like to see the world you know come to an end, in a severance of the connection between people and land that has deep relevance for our time of climate crisis and forced migration.

一个时代让位给另一个时代的那一刻让 Crace 着迷。在这里，正是公地的圈地，英国历史的一个支点，推动了他关于剥夺和流离失所的故事。故事发生在一个没有名字的村庄，讲述了看到你所知道的世界走到尽头的感觉，人与土地之间的联系被切断，这与我们这个气候危机和被迫迁移的时代有着深远的关联。

[Jemisin](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/27/nk-jemisin-interview-fantasy-science-fiction-writing-racism-sexism) became the first African American author to win the best novel category at the Hugo awards for her first book in the Broken Earth trilogy. In her intricate and richly imagined far future universe, the world is ending, ripped apart by relentless earthquakes and volcanoes. Against this apocalyptic backdrop she explores urgent questions of power and enslavement through the eyes of three women. “As this genre finally acknowledges that the dreams of the marginalised matter and that all of us have a future,” she said in her acceptance speech, “so will go the world. (Soon, I hope.)”

杰米辛凭借《破碎的地球》三部曲中的第一部作品，成为第一位获得雨果奖最佳小说类奖项的非裔美国作家。在她错综复杂、想象丰富的遥远未来宇宙中，世界正在走向终结，被无情的地震和火山撕裂。在这个世界末日的背景下，她通过三位女性的眼睛探讨了权力和奴役的紧迫问题。 “随着这一流派最终承认边缘化的梦想很重要，我们所有人都有未来，”她在获奖感言中说，“世界也会如此。 （很快，我希望。）”

## **Thinking, Fast and Slow 思考，快与慢**

## by Daniel Kahneman (2011) 丹尼尔·卡尼曼 (2011)

The Nobel laureate’s unexpected bestseller, on the minutiae of decision-making, divides the brain into two. System One makes judgments quickly, intuitively and automatically, as when a batsman decides whether to cut or pull. System Two is slow, calculated and deliberate, like long division. But psychologist Kahneman argues that, although System Two thinks it is in control, many of our decisions are really made by System One.

这位诺贝尔奖获得者出人意料的畅销书在决策制定的细节上将大脑一分为二。 System One 做出快速、直观和自动的判断，就像击球手决定是切球还是拉球一样。系统二是缓慢的、经过深思熟虑的，就像长除法一样。但心理学家卡尼曼认为，尽管系统二认为它处于控制之中，但我们的许多决定实际上是由系统一做出的。

In this existential eco-thriller, a William Blake-obsessed eccentric investigates the murders of men and animals in a remote Polish village. More accessible and focused than _Flights_, the novel that won Tokarczuk the Man International Booker prize, it is no less profound in its examination of how atavistic male impulses, emboldened by the new rightwing politics of Europe, are endangering people, communities and nature itself.

在这部关于生存主义的生态惊悚片中，一个痴迷于威廉·布莱克的怪人调查了一个偏远的波兰村庄发生的人畜谋杀案。比赢得托卡尔丘克国际布克奖的小说《飞行》更易读、更专注，它同样深刻地审视了欧洲新右翼政治助长的返祖男性冲动如何危及人类、社区和自然本身。

In this savagely beautiful novel set during the Indian wars and American civil war, a young Irish boy flees famine-struck Sligo for Missouri. There he finds lifelong companionship with another emigrant, and they join the army on its brutal journey west, laying waste to Indian settlements. Viscerally focused and intense, yet imbued with the grandeur of the landscape, the book explores love, gender and survival with a rare, luminous power.

## by Barbara Demick (2009) 芭芭拉·德米克 (2009)

Los Angeles Times journalist Barbara Demick interviewed around 100 North Korean defectors for this propulsive work of narrative non-fiction, but she focuses on just six, all from the north-eastern city of Chongjin – closed to foreigners and less media-ready than Pyongyang. North Korea is revealed to be rife with poverty, corruption and violence but populated by resilient people with a remarkable ability to see past the propaganda all around them.

《洛杉矶时报》记者芭芭拉·德米克 (Barbara Demick) 为这部具有推动力的非虚构叙事作品采访了大约 100 名朝鲜叛逃者，但她只关注了六名，他们都来自东北部城市清津——对外国人不开放，媒体准备程度不如平壤。据透露，朝鲜充斥着贫困、腐败和暴力，但那里居住着坚韧不拔的人民，他们具有非凡的能力，能够看穿周围的宣传。

## **The Age of Surveillance Capitalism  
监视资本主义时代  
**

## by Shoshana Zuboff (2019) 作者：Shoshana Zuboff (2019)

An agenda-setting book that is devastating about the extent to which big tech sets out to manipulate us for profit. Not simply another expression of the “techlash”, Zuboff’s ambitious study identifies a new form of capitalism, one involving the monitoring and shaping of our behaviour, often without our knowledge, with profound implications for democracy. “Once we searched Google, but now Google searches us.”

一本设定议程的书，它对大型科技公司为了利润而开始操纵我们的程度进行了毁灭性的描述。 Zuboff 的雄心勃勃的研究不仅仅是“技术冲击”的另一种表达方式，它确定了一种新的资本主义形式，一种涉及对我们行为的监控和塑造，通常在我们不知情的情况下，对民主具有深远的影响。 “曾经我们搜索谷歌，但现在谷歌搜索我们。”

## by Chris Ware (2000) 克里斯·韦尔 (2000)

At the time when Ware won the Guardian first book award, no graphic novel had previously won a generalist literary prize. Emotional and artistic complexity are perfectly poised in this account of a listless 36-year-old office dogsbody who is thrown into an existential crisis by an encounter with his estranged dad.

在 Ware 获得卫报第一图书奖时，此前还没有任何图画小说获得通才文学奖。情感和艺术的复杂性在这个描述中完美地展现了一个无精打采的 36 岁办公室狗身体，他因与他疏远的父亲的相遇而陷入生存危机。

## **Notes on a Scandal 丑闻笔记**

## by Zoë Heller (2003) 佐伊·海勒 (2003)

Sheba, a middle-aged teacher at a London comprehensive, begins an affair with her 15-year-old student - but we hear about it from a fellow teacher, the needy Barbara, whose obsessive nature drives the narrative. With shades of Patricia Highsmith, this teasing investigation into sex, class and loneliness is a dark marvel.

希巴 (Sheba) 是伦敦一家综合性学校的中年教师，她开始与她 15 岁的学生发生婚外情——但我们是从一位贫穷的老师同事那里听说这件事的，她的强迫症天性推动了故事的发展。带着帕特里夏·海史密斯 (Patricia Highsmith) 的影子，这部对性、阶级和孤独的戏弄式调查是一个黑暗的奇迹。

Javier Marías (2011)，Margaret Jull Costa 翻译 (2013)  

The Spanish master examines chance, love and death in the story of an apparently random killing that gradually reveals hidden depths. Marías constructs an elegant murder mystery from his trademark labyrinthine sentences, but this investigation is in pursuit of much meatier questions than whodunnit.

这位西班牙大师在一个看似随机的杀戮故事中审视了机会、爱情和死亡，逐渐揭示了隐藏的深度。玛丽亚斯从他标志性的迷宫般的句子中构建了一个优雅的谋杀之谜，但这项调查是为了寻找比 whodunnit 更真实的问题。

## by John le Carré (2001) 约翰·勒卡雷 (2001)

The master of the cold war thriller turned his attention to the new world order in this chilling investigation into the corruption powering big pharma in Africa. Based on the case of a rogue antibiotics trial that killed and maimed children in Nigeria in the 1990s, it has all the dash and authority of his earlier novels while precisely and presciently anatomising the dangers of a rampant neo-imperialist capitalism.

这部冷战惊悚片的大师将注意力转向了新的世界秩序，调查了非洲大型制药公司的腐败行为。基于 1990 年代在尼日利亚导致儿童死亡和致残的流氓抗生素试验案例，它具有他早期小说的所有冲劲和权威，同时准确而有先见之明地剖析了猖獗的新帝国主义资本主义的危险。

## **The Silence of the Girls 少女的沉默**

## by Pat Barker (2018) 帕特·巴克 (2018)

If the western literary canon is founded on Homer, then it is founded on women’s silence. Barker’s extraordinary intervention, in which she replays the events of the _Iliad_ from the point of view of the enslaved Trojan women, chimed with both the #MeToo movement and a wider drive to foreground suppressed voices. In a world still at war, it has chilling contemporary resonance.

如果说西方文学经典是建立在荷马的基础上，那么它就是建立在女性的沉默之上。巴克非凡的干预，她从被奴役的特洛伊妇女的角度重播了伊利亚特的事件，与#MeToo 运动和更广泛的前景压抑的声音相呼应。在一个仍处于战争状态的世界里，它在当代引起了令人不寒而栗的共鸣。

The deliciously dark US crime thriller that launched a thousand imitators and took the concept of the unreliable narrator to new heights. A woman disappears: we think we know whodunit, but we’re wrong. Flynn’s stylishly written portrait of a toxic marriage set against a backdrop of social and economic insecurity combines psychological depth with sheer unputdownable flair.

这部美味黑暗的美国犯罪惊悚片吸引了一千名模仿者，并将不可靠的叙述者的概念推向了新的高度。一个女人失踪了：我们认为我们知道侦探，但我们错了。弗林在社会和经济不安全的背景下，以时尚的笔触描绘了一段有毒的婚姻，结合了心理深度和绝对令人钦佩的天赋。

## by Rebecca Skloot (2010) 丽贝卡·斯克鲁特 (2010)

Henrietta Lacks was a black American who died in agony of cancer in a “coloured” hospital ward in 1951. Her cells, taken without her knowledge during a biopsy, went on to change medical history, being used around the world to develop countless drugs. Skloot skilfully tells the extraordinary scientific story, but in this book the voices of the Lacks children are crucial – they have struggled desperately even as billions have been made from their mother’s “HeLa” cells.

亨丽埃塔·拉克斯 (Henrietta Lacks) 是一名美国黑人，1951 年在“有色人种”医院病房中死于癌症的痛苦。她的细胞在她不知情的情况下进行活检，后来改变了医学史，在世界各地被用于开发无数药物。 Skloot 巧妙地讲述了非凡的科学故事，但在这本书中，Lacks 孩子的声音至关重要——即使从他们母亲的“海拉”细胞中赚取了数十亿美元，他们也在拼命挣扎。

A very complex story is told with page-turning urgency and what may now be read as nostalgic faith in “the European idea”.

这部自 1945 年以来对欧洲的宏大调查从第二次世界大战留下的破坏开始，提供了从冷战开始到苏联集团解体的全景叙述——其中一部分是朱特在捷克斯洛伐克的天鹅绒革命中亲眼目睹的。一个非常复杂的故事以翻页的紧迫感讲述，现在可以理解为对“欧洲理念”的怀旧信仰。

## **Hope in the Dark 黑暗中的希望**

## by Rebecca Solnit (2004) 丽贝卡·索尔尼 (2004)

Writing against “the tremendous despair at the height of the Bush administration’s powers and the outset of the war in Iraq”, the US thinker finds optimism in political activism and its ability to change the world. The book ranges widely from the fall of the Berlin wall to the Zapatista uprising in Mexico, to the invention of Viagra.

这位美国思想家针对“布什政府权力鼎盛时期和伊拉克战争开始时的巨大绝望”，在政治激进主义及其改变世界的能力中找到了乐观情绪。这本书的范围很广，从柏林墙的倒塌到墨西哥的萨帕塔起义，再到伟哥的发明。

From the slow emergency response in the black suburbs destroyed by hurricane Katrina to a mother trying to move her daughter away from a black passenger on a plane, the poet’s award-winning prose work confronts the history of racism in the US and asks: regardless of their actual status, who truly gets to be a citizen?

## **Moneyball 点球成金**

## by Michael Lewis (2010) 迈克尔·刘易斯 (2010)

The author of _The Big Short_ has made a career out of rendering the most opaque subject matter entertaining and comprehensible: _Moneyball_ tells the story of how geeks outsmarted jocks to revolutionise baseball using maths. But you do not need to know or care about the sport, because – as with all Lewis’s best writing – it’s all about how the story is told.

The Big Short 的作者的职业生涯是将最晦涩的主题变得有趣和易于理解：Moneyball 讲述了极客如何智胜运动员，利用数学彻底改变棒球的故事。但你不需要了解或关心这项运动，因为——就像刘易斯所有最好的作品一样——一切都与故事的讲述方式有关。

## **Atonement 赎罪**

## by Ian McEwan (2001) 伊恩·麦克尤恩 (2001)

There are echoes of DH Lawrence and EM Forster in McEwan’s finely tuned dissection of memory and guilt. The fates of three young people are altered by a young girl’s lie at the close of a sweltering day on a country estate in 1935. Lifelong remorse, the horror of war and devastating twists are to follow in an elegant, deeply felt meditation on the power of love and art.

麦克尤恩对记忆和罪恶感的细致剖析与 DH Lawrence 和 EM Forster 相呼应。 1935 年，在一个闷热的一天结束时，在一个乡村庄园里，一个年轻女孩的谎言改变了三个年轻人的命运。终生的悔恨、战争的恐怖和毁灭性的曲折将伴随着对权力的优雅、深刻的沉思爱与艺术。

Thatcher-era degeneracy is lavishly displayed as Nick falls in love with the son of a supermarket magnate, and the novel records how Aids began to poison gay life in London. In peerless prose, Hollinghurst captures something close to the spirit of an age.

牛津大学毕业生尼克·盖斯特 (Nick Guest) 搬进了一位冉冉升起的保守党议员在西伦敦的豪宅。尼克爱上了一位超市大亨的儿子，撒切尔时代的堕落得到了淋漓尽致的展现，小说记录了艾滋病如何开始毒害伦敦的同性恋生活。在无与伦比的散文中，霍林赫斯特抓住了接近时代精神的东西。

A reunion dominates the Irish novelist’s family drama, but the individual stories of the five members of the Madigan clan – the matriarch, Rosaleen, and her children, Dan, Emmet, Constance and Hanna, who escape and are bound to return – are beautifully held in balance. When the Madigans do finally come together halfway through the book, Enright masterfully reminds us of the weight of history and family.

Known for the firecracker phrases and broad satires of his fiction, Amis presented a much warmer face in his memoir. His life is haunted by the disappearance of his cousin Lucy, who is revealed 20 years later to have been murdered by Fred West. But Amis also has much fun recollecting his “velvet-suited, snakeskin-booted” youth, and paints a moving portrait of his father’s comic gusto as old age reduces him to a kind of “anti-Kingsley”.

The unlikely survival of the _netsuke_ entails De Waal telling a story that moves from Paris to Austria under the Nazis to Japan, and he beautifully conjures a sense of place. The book doubles as a set of profound reflections on objects and what they mean to us.

The end result is sublime.

Strikingly honest, originally written, with a galaxy of intellectual reference points, it is essentially a love story; one that seems to make a new way of living possible.

The beautifully written product of 15 years of research, _Capital_ made its author an intellectual star – the modern Marx – and opened readers’ eyes to how neoliberalism produces vastly increased inequalities. Full of data, theories and historical analysis, its message is clear, and prophetic: unless governments increase tax, the new and grotesque wealth levels of the rich will encourage political instability.

Atkinson examines family, history and the power of fiction as she tells the story of a woman born in 1910 – and then tells it again, and again, and again. Ursula Todd’s multiple lives see her strangled at birth, drowned on a Cornish beach, trapped in an awful marriage and visiting Adolf Hitler at Berchtesgaden. But this dizzying fictional construction is grounded by such emotional intelligence that her heroine’s struggles always feel painfully, joyously real.

阿特金森在讲述一位出生于 1910 年的女性的故事时审视了家庭、历史和虚构的力量——然后一遍又一遍地讲述。乌苏拉·托德 (Ursula Todd) 的多重人生见证了她在出生时被勒死、溺死在康沃尔海滩、陷入糟糕的婚姻并在贝希特斯加登拜访阿道夫·希特勒。但这种令人眼花缭乱的虚构结构是以如此高的情商为基础的，以至于她的女主人公的挣扎总是让人感到痛苦、快乐的真实。

Kolbert considers both ecosystems – the Great Barrier Reef, the Amazon rainforest – and the lives of some extinct and soon-to-be extinct creatures including the Sumatran rhino and “the most beautiful bird in the world”, the black-faced honeycreeper of Maui.[Read the review](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/14/sixth-extinction-unnatural-history-kolbert-review)

## **Fingersmith**

## by Sarah Waters (2002)

Moving from the underworld dens of Victorian London to the boudoirs of country house gothic, and hingeing on the seduction of an heiress, Waters’s third novel is a drippingly atmospheric thriller, a smart study of innocence and experience, and a sensuous lesbian love story – with a plot twist to make the reader gasp.

## **Nickel and Dimed**

## by Barbara Ehrenreich (2001)

In this modern classic of reportage, Ehrenreich chronicled her attempts to live on the minimum wage in three American states. Working first as a waitress, then a cleaner and a nursing home aide, she still struggled to survive, and the stories of her co-workers are shocking. The US economy as she experienced it is full of routine humiliation, with demands as high as the rewards are low. Two decades on, this still reads like urgent news.

## **The Plot Against America**

## by Philip Roth (2004)

What if aviator Charles Lindbergh, who once called Hitler “a great man”, had won the US presidency in a landslide victory and signed a treaty with Nazi Germany? Paranoid yet plausible, Roth’s alternative-world novel is only more relevant in the age of Trump.

## **My Brilliant Friend**

## by Elena Ferrante (2011), translated by Ann Goldstein (2012)

Powerfully intimate and unashamedly domestic, the first in [Ferrante’s Neapolitan series](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/31/elena-ferrante-literary-sensation-nobody-knows) established her as a literary sensation. This and the three novels that followed documented the ways misogyny and violence could determine lives, as well as the history of Italy in the late 20th century.

## **Half of a Yellow Sun**

## by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (2006)

When Nigerian author Adichie was growing up, the Biafran war “hovered over everything”. Her sweeping, evocative novel, which won the Orange prize, charts the political and personal struggles of those caught up in the conflict and explores the brutal legacy of colonialism in Africa.

## **Cloud Atlas**

## David Mitchell (2004)

The epic that made Mitchell’s name is a Russian doll of a book, nesting stories within stories and spanning centuries and genres with aplomb. From a 19th-century seafarer to a tale from beyond the end of civilisation, via 1970s nuclear intrigue and the testimony of a future clone, these dizzying narratives are delicately interlinked, highlighting the echoes and recurrences of the vast human symphony.

## **Autumn**

## by Ali Smith (2016)

Smith began writing her Seasonal Quartet, a still-ongoing experiment in quickfire publishing, against the background of the EU referendum. The resulting “first Brexit novel” isn’t just a snapshot of a newly divided Britain, but a dazzling exploration into love and art, time and dreams, life and death, all done with her customary invention and wit.

## **Between the World and Me**

## by Ta-Nehisi Coates (2015)

Coates’s impassioned meditation on what it means to be a black American today made him one of the country’s most important intellectuals and writers. Having grown up the son of a former Black Panther on the violent streets of Baltimore, he has a voice that is challenging but also poetic. _Between the World and Me_ takes the form of a letter to his teenage son, and ranges from the daily reality of racial injustice and police violence to the history of slavery and the civil war: white people, he writes, will never remember “the scale of theft that enriched them”.

## **The Amber Spyglass**

## by Philip Pullman (2000)

Children’s fiction came of age when the final part of Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy became the first book for younger readers to win the Whitbread book of the year award. Pullman has brought imaginative fire and storytelling bravado to the weightiest of subjects: religion, free will, totalitarian structures and the human drive to learn, rebel and grow. Here Asriel’s struggle against the Authority reaches its climax, Lyra and Will journey to the Land of the Dead, and Mary investigates the mysterious elementary particles that lend their name to his current trilogy: The Book of Dust. The Hollywood-fuelled commercial success achieved by JK Rowling may have eluded Pullman so far, but his sophisticated reworking of _Paradise Lost_ helped adult readers throw off any embarrassment at enjoying fiction written for children – and publishing has never looked back.

## **Austerlitz**

## by WG Sebald (2001), translated by Anthea Bell (2001)

Sebald died in a car crash in 2001, but his genre-defying mix of fact and fiction, keen sense of the moral weight of history and interleaving of inner and outer journeys have had a huge influence on the contemporary literary landscape. His final work, the typically allusive life story of one man, charts the Jewish disapora and lost 20th century with heartbreaking power. _[Read the review](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/29/fiction.reviews3)_

## **Never Let Me Go**

## by Kazuo Ishiguro (2005)

From his 1989 Booker winner _The Remains of the Day_ to 2015’s _The Buried Giant_, Nobel laureate Ishiguro writes profound, puzzling allegories about history, nationalism and the individual’s place in a world that is always beyond our understanding. His sixth novel, a love triangle set among human clones in an alternative 1990s England, brings exquisite understatement to its exploration of mortality, loss and what it means to be human.

## **Secondhand Time**

## by Svetlana Alexievich (2013), translated by Bela Shayevich (2016)

The [Belarusian Nobel laureate](https://www.theguardian.com/books/svetlana-alexievich) recorded thousands of hours of testimony from ordinary people to create this oral history of the Soviet Union and its end. Writers, waiters, doctors, soldiers, former Kremlin apparatchiks, gulag survivors: all are given space to tell their stories, share their anger and betrayal, and voice their worries about the transition to capitalism. An unforgettable book, which is both an act of catharsis and a profound demonstration of empathy.

## **Gilead**

## by Marilynne Robinson (2004)

Robinson’s meditative, deeply philosophical novel is told through letters written by elderly preacher John Ames in the 1950s to his young son who, when he finally reaches an adulthood his father won’t see, will at least have this posthumous one-sided conversation: “While you read this, I am imperishable, somehow more alive than I have ever been.” This is a book about legacy, a record of a pocket of America that will never return, a reminder of the heartbreaking, ephemeral beauty that can be found in everyday life. As Ames concludes, to his son and himself: “There are a thousand thousand reasons to live this life, every one of them sufficient.”

## **Wolf Hall**

## by Hilary Mantel (2009)

Mantel had been publishing for a quarter century before the project that made her a phenomenon, set to be concluded with the third part of the trilogy, _The Mirror and the Light_, next March. To read her story of the rise of Thomas Cromwell at the Tudor court, detailing the making of a new England and the self-creation of a new kind of man, is to step into the stream of her irresistibly authoritative present tense and find oneself looking out from behind her hero’s eyes. The surface details are sensuously, vividly immediate, the language as fresh as new paint; but her exploration of power, fate and fortune is also deeply considered and constantly in dialogue with our own era, as we are shaped and created by the past. In this book we have, as she intended, “a sense of history listening and talking to itself”.
