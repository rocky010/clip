A businessman is sitting on the beach of a small fishing village when he sees a fisherman approach the shore with his daily haul. Impressed by the quality of the fish, the businessman asks the fisherman how long it took him to bring in his catch.

一位商人正坐在一个小渔村的海滩上，这时他看到一位渔夫带着他每天的收获接近岸边。商人对鱼的质量印象深刻，问渔夫他花了多长时间才把渔获带回来。

“Just a short while,” the fisherman replies.  
“就一会儿，”渔夫回答道。  

“Why don’t you stay out longer to catch more fish?” the businessman asks.  
“你为什么不在外面多呆一会儿，抓更多的鱼呢？”商人问。  

“Because this is all I need.”  
“因为这就是我所需要的。”  

“But then what do you do with your time?”  
“那你怎么打发时间呢？”  

“I sleep late, catch a few fish, play with my kids, take a nap with my wife, and then join my buddies in town to drink wine and play guitar,” the fisherman responds.

“我睡得很晚，抓了几条鱼，和我的孩子们一起玩，和我的妻子一起睡午觉，然后和我在城里的哥们一起喝酒弹吉他，”渔夫回答道。

The businessman is shocked. He explains that he has an MBA, and that if the fisherman follows his advice, he could help him grow his business. “You could buy a bigger boat,” the businessman says, “and use the proceeds to open your own cannery.”

商人惊呆了。他解释说他拥有 MBA 学位，如果渔夫听从他的建议，他可以帮助他发展业务。 “你可以买一艘更大的船，”这位商人说，“然后用所得款项开办自己的罐头厂。”

“Then what?” the fisherman asks. “然后呢？”渔夫问道。

“You could move to the city to open a distribution center.”  
“你可以搬到城里去开一个配送中心。”  

“And then what?” “然后什么？”

“You could expand your business internationally and eventually take your company public,” the businessman says. “When the time is right, you could sell your shares and become very rich.”

“你可以在国际上扩展你的业务，并最终让你的公司上市，”这位商人说。 “当时机成熟时，你可以卖掉你的股票，变得非常富有。”

“And then what?” “然后什么？”

“Well, then you can retire, move to a small fishing village, sleep late, catch a few fish, play with your kids, take naps with your wife, and join your buddies in town to drink wine and play guitar.”

“嗯，那你就可以退休了，搬到一个小渔村，睡个懒觉，抓几条鱼，陪孩子玩，陪老婆睡午觉，和城里的哥们儿喝酒弹吉他。”

The fisherman smiles at the businessman and continues down the beach.  
渔夫对商人微笑，继续沿着海滩走下去。  

I love this little parable. It’s an adaptation of a German short story from 1963 and has since been translated and shared widely. 

我喜欢这个小寓言。它改编自 1963 年的德国短篇小说，此后被广泛翻译和分享。

I first came across it in a Facebook post. It wasn’t just the story, but the first comment that has stuck with me since. Under the post, someone wrote, “There’s nothing noble about a life of mere sustenance. His life of idyll is great until he gets sick, there’s an algae bloom that kills the fish, or his boat throws a rod. He needs the extra investment capital to weather the unknown.” 

我第一次看到它是在 Facebook 帖子中。这不仅仅是故事，而且是从那以后一直困扰着我的第一条评论。在帖子下，有人写道：“仅仅维持生计的生活没有什么高尚的。他的田园诗般的生活一直很美好，直到他生病，藻类大量繁殖杀死了鱼，或者他的船扔了一根鱼竿。他需要额外的投资资金来应对未知的情况。”

I was tempted to roll my eyes. I knew that type of reply guy. He’s the one who raises his hand in English class because he “disagrees with the premise of the question.” 

我忍不住翻了个白眼。我知道那种回复的人。他是在英语课上举手的人，因为他“不同意问题的前提”。

At the same time, he had a point. The tension between the fisherman and the commenter’s retort represents one of the most important questions we face: how do we balance the pursuit of a secure living with a meaningful life?

同时，他说的有道理。渔夫和评论者反驳之间的紧张关系代表了我们面临的最重要的问题之一：我们如何平衡追求安全的生活和有意义的生活？

## What role _should_ work play in our lives?  
工作在我们的生活中应该扮演什么角色？  

Two caveats before we get into it. First, I can’t answer that question for you. Your relationship to work is yours to determine. Though not everyone has the privilege to dictate what they do or how many hours they work, we all have the ability to form a perspective on work’s role in our lives. If you don’t set boundaries around your work, it can easily seep like a gas into all of the unoccupied spaces. 

在我们进入它之前有两个警告。首先，我不能为你回答这个问题。您与工作的关系由您决定。虽然不是每个人都有特权决定他们做什么或工作多少小时，但我们都有能力形成对工作在我们生活中的作用的看法。如果你不为你的工作设定界限，它很容易像气体一样渗入所有未被占用的空间。

Second, the role work plays in our lives is not fixed—nor should we want it to be. It’s by wrestling with work’s place that we figure out what we care about—how our careers stack up against our values, our loved ones, or whatever else we hold dear. There will be seasons when we’ll prioritize work and those when we’ll prioritize life outside of work. So I’m wary of any one-size-fits-all prescription or the idolization of “work-life balance,” as if there’s some mythical state to which we should all aspire. 

其次，工作在我们生活中扮演的角色不是固定的——我们也不应该希望它是固定的。通过与工作的斗争，我们弄清楚了我们关心的是什么——我们的职业如何与我们的价值观、我们所爱的人或我们所珍视的任何东西相提并论。有时我们会优先考虑工作，有时我们会优先考虑工作以外的生活。因此，我对任何一刀切的处方或对“工作与生活平衡”的偶像化都持谨慎态度，就好像我们都应该向往某种神话般的状态。

That being said, I’ve spent the past three years [writing a book](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/704142/the-good-enough-job-by-simone-stolzoff/) about how work has come to dominate our lives and how to reclaim our lives from its clutches. Here’s where I net out. 

话虽这么说，过去三年我一直在写一本书，讲述工作如何主宰我们的生活，以及如何让我们的生活摆脱工作的束缚。这是我得出结论的地方。

I came into the book project thinking I was going to write a manifesto for the fisherman—a declaration of support for the simpler, less work-centric life. I had observed how central work had become to my own life, the lives of my peers, and the culture of our county. The balance felt off. We worshiped celebrity CEOs, plastered “Do What You Love” messages on the walls of our coworking spaces, and treated jobs [akin](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/) to religious identities. But as a result, to paraphrase psychotherapist Esther Perel, too many people brought the best of themselves to work and kept the leftovers at home. 

我进入图书项目时以为我要为渔夫写一份宣言——一份支持更简单、更少以工作为中心的生活的宣言。我观察到工作是如何成为我自己的生活、我的同龄人的生活以及我们县的文化的中心。感觉不平衡了。我们崇拜名人 CEO，在我们的联合办公空间的墙上贴上“做你喜欢做的事”的信息，并像对待宗教身份一样对待工作。但结果，用心理治疗师 Esther Perel 的话说，太多的人把最好的自己带到工作中，把剩下的留在家里。

Over the course of reporting and writing, though, my hot take tempered into something more lukewarm. (Mind you, I began the book pre-pandemic, pre-great resignation, pre-quiet quitting, and pre- whatever anti-work meme trends next.) I still believe we ought to design our work around our lives rather than the other way around. But I don’t think the [“work sucks”](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/) view serves workers either. 

不过，在报道和写作的过程中，我的热情逐渐变得不冷不热。 （请注意，我在大流行前、伟大的辞职前、安静的戒烟前以及接下来的任何反工作迷因趋势前开始了这本书。）我仍然相信我们应该围绕我们的生活而不是其他人来设计我们的工作一路走来。但我认为“工作很糟糕”的观点也不适合工人。

The truth is we work more than we do anything else—more than we eat, or see our families or friends. How we spend those hours matters. Framing work as a necessary evil does not necessarily lead to fulfillment. Part of my critique of anti-work and anti-capitalist memes is that there aren’t many viable alternatives. We must all still pay rent. 

事实上，我们工作比做任何其他事情都多——比我们吃饭、看望家人或朋友的时间还多。我们如何度过这些时间很重要。将工作视为必要之恶并不一定会带来成就感。我对反工作和反资本主义模因的部分批评是，没有太多可行的选择。我们仍然必须支付租金。

Sure, UBI experiments and countries with robust social safety nets show how it’s possible to make the consequences of not working less dire. But the reality is that the majority of us will work for the majority of our lives. The more interesting inquiry is not whether you are pro- or anti-work, but how you can fit work into your vision of a life well lived.

当然，UBI 实验和拥有强大社会安全网的国家展示了如何让不工作的后果变得不那么可怕。但现实情况是，我们大多数人一生中的大部分时间都在工作。更有趣的问题不是你是赞成还是反对工作，而是你如何才能让工作融入你对美好生活的愿景。

## What does the science say? 科学怎么说？

If I can’t tell you how you should think about work, I can at least share some research that has helped me think through its place in my life. Here are three principles that might help you evaluate your relationship with what you do. 

如果我不能告诉你应该如何看待工作，我至少可以分享一些帮助我思考它在我生活中的位置的研究。以下三个原则可以帮助您评估您与所做工作的关系。

### Finding intrinsic motivation tends to be more fulfilling than extrinsic motivation  
寻找内在动机往往比外在动机更有成就感  

In one of the most famous [psychology experiments](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1974-10497-001) on motivation, researchers observed how students at a local preschool spent their free time. After identifying which kids chose drawing as their free time activity, they divided the young artists into three groups. 

在最著名的动机心理学实验之一中，研究人员观察了当地一所幼儿园的学生如何度过他们的空闲时间。在确定哪些孩子选择绘画作为他们的业余活动后，他们将年轻艺术家分为三组。

One group of students was shown a “Good Player Award,” a certificate with a gold star, red ribbon, and the student’s name. The researchers told the students in this group that if they drew, they would receive an award. Group two wasn’t shown an award, but if the students chose to draw, they were given one at the end of the session. Group three was not shown or given any awards.

一组学生获得了“优秀球员奖”，这是一张带有金星、红丝带和学生姓名的证书。研究人员告诉这组学生，如果他们画画，就会得到奖励。第二组没有奖品，但如果学生选择画画，他们会在课程结束时获得一个奖品。第三组没有展示或授予任何奖项。

Two weeks after the experiment, the researchers returned to the classroom to observe the students again. The students in groups two and three drew just as much after the experiment as they did before. But students in the first group—those who expected to receive an award after drawing—now spent less time drawing than they did before the experiment. 

实验两周后，研究人员再次回到教室对学生进行观察。第二组和第三组的学生在实验后和实验前一样多地画画。但是第一组的学生——那些希望在绘画后获得奖励的学生——现在花在绘画上的时间比实验前少了。

It wasn’t the presence of the award but the expectation of receiving it that dampened the students’ interest in drawing. The researchers concluded that internal satisfaction from an activity may decrease when the promise of an external reward looms. The experiment has since been replicated many times with other groups of students and adults, yielding similar results. 

不是奖项的存在，而是对获奖的期望削弱了学生对绘画的兴趣。研究人员得出结论，当外部奖励的承诺若隐若现时，一项活动的内部满意度可能会降低。该实验已在其他学生和成人组中重复多次，产生了相似的结果。

The career implications from this experiment are straightforward: working for extrinsic validation alone, like a high salary, fancy title, or the adult equivalent of a “Good Player Award,” is a less sustainable approach than pursuing work you enjoy doing. The experiment proved something we intuitively know: working exclusively for external rewards rarely brings lasting fulfillment. As the old saying goes, _How much money is enough, Mr. Rockefeller? Just a little bit more._

这个实验对职业的影响是直截了当的：仅仅为了外在的认可而工作，比如高薪、花哨的头衔，或者相当于“优秀球员奖”的成人等价物，与追求你喜欢做的工作相比，是一种不太可持续的方法。这个实验证明了我们凭直觉知道的事情：只为外部奖励而工作很少能带来持久的满足感。俗话说，多少钱才够，洛克菲勒先生？再多一点。

### Valuing time tends to be more fulfilling than valuing money   
珍惜时间往往比珍惜金钱更有成就感  

In the mid-1970s, the average American, German, and French worker all worked roughly the same amount of hours per year. In the developed world, average working hours had fallen for the majority of the 20th century, thanks to technological advancements, labor organizing, and increases in wealth. Historically, the richer a person or a country became, the less they worked because, well, they could afford not to. 

在 20 世纪 70 年代中期，美国、德国和法国工人的平均年工作时长大致相同。在发达国家，由于技术进步、劳动力组织和财富增加，20 世纪大部分时间的平均工作时间都在下降。从历史上看，一个人或一个国家变得越富有，他们工作的时间就越少，因为，好吧，他们负担不起。

But in the mid-1970s, a strange trend began in the U.S. While the average worker’s hours in our peer nations continued to decline, the average American’s working hours flatlined. And some American workers, namely college-educated men, started to work more than ever. Explaining this trend is another essay entirely, but suffice to say that rather than trade wealth for more free time, as was customary for most of history, American elites started trading their free time for more work.

但在 20 世纪 70 年代中期，美国出现了一种奇怪的趋势。虽然我们同行国家的平均工人工作时间持续下降，但美国人的平均工作时间却持平。一些美国工人，即受过大学教育的男性，开始比以往任何时候都更多地工作。解释这种趋势完全是另一篇文章，但足以说明，美国精英开始用他们的空闲时间换取更多的工作，而不是像大多数历史上的习惯那样用财富换取更多的空闲时间。

It’s well-documented that increasing your wealth can lead to more happiness to a point. But once our basic needs are accounted for, a growing body of research has proven that prioritizing time outweighs prioritizing wealth. In thinking about work’s role in your life—especially if you’re relatively well-off—it’s worth considering that valuing more free time over more money leads to more fulfilling [career decisions](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/19-048_a3814174-e598-46af-ae70-0c81cdffdb9e.pdf) and higher overall [well-being](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283619534_Valuing_Time_Over_Money_Is_Associated_With_Greater_Happiness). 

有据可查的是，增加财富可以在一定程度上带来更多幸福。但是，一旦考虑到我们的基本需求，越来越多的研究表明，优先考虑时间胜过优先考虑财富。在思考工作在你生活中的作用时——尤其是如果你相对富裕的话——值得考虑的是，重视更多的空闲时间而不是更多的金钱会导致更令人满意的职业决策和更高的整体幸福感。

### Satisficing tends to be more fulfilling than maximizing  
满足往往比最大化更令人满意  

Imagine you’re buying a sweater. You find one that fits well and looks good for a fair price. If you’re what social scientists call “a maximizer,” you might ask the clerk to put the sweater on hold so you can spend the rest of the day going to other stores to ensure there isn’t a better sweater out there. On the other hand, if you’re a so-called “satisficer”—a portmanteau of satisfy and suffice—you’ll likely feel alright about buying the first sweater and move on with your day. 

假设您要购买一件毛衣。您会找到一件合身且看起来不错的，而且价格合理。如果你是社会科学家所说的“最大化者”，你可能会要求店员搁置毛衣，这样你就可以在一天的剩余时间里去其他商店，以确保那里没有更好的毛衣。另一方面，如果你是所谓的“满足者”——满足和足够的合成词——你可能会觉得买第一件毛衣并继续你的一天。

A satisficer determines their criteria, and once they find something that meets their standards, they stop searching, whereas maximizers want to be sure that every decision is the best decision they could possibly make. In the [words](https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2021/11/how-to-prioritize-joy-lorigottlieb-arthurbrooks-happiness-2021/620787/) of psychologist Lori Gottlieb, “The satisficer is one who wants what she has, and the maximizer is the one who is always chasing, trying to have what he wants.”

满足者确定他们的标准，一旦他们找到符合他们标准的东西，他们就会停止搜索，而最大化者希望确保每个决定都是他们可能做出的最佳决定。用心理学家 Lori Gottlieb 的话来说，“满足者是一个想要她所拥有的东西的人，而最大化者是一个一直在追逐、试图拥有他想要的东西的人。”

While there are benefits and drawbacks to each approach, the research says that satisficers tend to be happier. Even if the maximizer exhausts all of the other options and returns to the store to buy the original sweater, they tend to be less fulfilled than the satisficer who bought the sweater right away.

虽然每种方法各有利弊，但研究表明，满足者往往更快乐。即使最大化者用尽了所有其他选择并返回商店购买原来的毛衣，他们的满足感往往不如立即购买毛衣的满足者。

From a work perspective, many of us have internalized the message that there is one dream job out there and we shouldn’t settle until we find it. We tweak our resumes and browse LinkedIn in the hopes that our next role will help us self-actualize. But perhaps a satisficer approach, where we [determine what matters and recognize when we have it](https://maven.com/simone-stolzoff/designing-your-next-career-step), is a better recipe for happiness.

从工作的角度来看，我们中的许多人已经内化了这样一个信息，那就是有一份理想的工作，我们不应该在找到它之前安顿下来。我们调整我们的简历并浏览 LinkedIn，希望我们的下一个角色能帮助我们实现自我。但也许更令人满意的方法是我们确定重要的事情并在拥有它时认识到这一点，这是获得幸福的更好方法。

I named my book [_The Good Enough Job_](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/704142/the-good-enough-job-by-simone-stolzoff/) as a nod to the satisficer approach to job-seeking. Compared to the perfect or dream job, “good enough” is a more forgiving ideal. It doesn’t idealize what a job can offer nor accept that work must be endless toil. Fundamentally, good enough is an invitation to choose what sufficiency means to you—perhaps it's a job that pays a certain wage, gets off at a certain hour, or gives you the time and energy to do what you love when you’re not working.

我将我的书命名为“足够好的工作”是对求职者的满意方法的认可。与完美或理想的工作相比，“足够好”是一种更宽容的理想。它没有理想化一份工作可以提供什么，也没有接受工作必须是无休止的辛劳。从根本上说，足够好是一种选择自给自足对你意味着什么的邀请——也许这是一份支付一定工资、在一定时间下班，或者在你不工作的时候给你时间和精力去做你喜欢做的事情的工作.

However you define “good enough,” though, I hope you recognize it when you find it. The fisherman may think you work too much. The reply guy may think you’re not being sufficiently responsible. But their opinion on work doesn’t matter nearly as much as your own. 

不管你如何定义“足够好”，我希望你在找到它时能认出它。渔夫可能认为你工作太多了。回复人可能认为你不够负责任。但他们对工作的看法几乎没有你自己的那么重要。
