_A lot of people are thinking very hard about the future of work right now, given the explosion in the capability and popularity of generative AI. I [recently co-wrote a post](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/generative-ai-autocomplete-for-everything) about how large language models and AI art might change creative jobs, but that really only scratches the surface. Job roles and tasks have shifted continuously since the start of the Industrial Revolution, and I expect this trend to continue in the age of AI.  
鉴于生成式 AI 的能力和流行程度的爆炸式增长，很多人现在都在认真思考工作的未来。我最近与人合着了一篇关于大型语言模型和 AI 艺术如何改变创造性工作的帖子，但这实际上只是触及了表面。自工业革命开始以来，工作角色和任务不断发生变化，我预计这种趋势将在人工智能时代继续下去。_

_Today’s guest post offers a highly creative idea about what the jobs of the future might look like. [Hollis Robbins](https://twitter.com/anecdotal) is the Dean of Humanities at the University of Utah, and has studied organization theory and bureaucracy. In this post, she predicts that secretaries could be in demand in the AI-driven future — not as old-style administrative assistants, but as confidantes and advisors.  
今天的客座帖子提供了一个关于未来工作可能是什么样子的极富创意的想法。霍利斯·罗宾斯 (Hollis Robbins) 是犹他大学人文学院院长，研究过组织理论和官僚主义。在这篇文章中，她预测在 AI 驱动的未来可能需要秘书——不是作为老式的行政助理，而是作为红颜知己和顾问。_

The ‘secretary’ literally means ‘person entrusted with secrets,’ from the medieval Latin _secretarius,_  
“秘书”的字面意思是“受托秘密的人”，来自中世纪的拉丁文secretarius， the trusted officer who writes the letters and keeps the records. The secretarial role originally conceived was far more central than roles with the “assistant” title now standard.  
写信和保存记录的可信赖的官员。最初设想的秘书角色比现在标准的“助理”头衔的角色要重要得多。  
In the nineteenth century, the secretary was a prized role for young men: a diplomatic assistant, the overseer of correspondence, the superintendent of the files, and in many cases, an apprentice manager—well-positioned to learn at the elbow of the man in charge, someday to be the man in charge.  
在 19 世纪，秘书是年轻人最看重的角色：外交助理、信件主管、档案主管，在许多情况下，还担任见习经理——可以在男人的肘部学习负责人，总有一天会成为负责人。  
The invention of stenography machines and commercial typewriters at the end of the century transformed the business world. Dozens of secretarial schools were established, most famously, the  
本世纪末速记机和商用打字机的发明改变了商业世界。建立了数十所秘书学校，最著名的是[Katharine Gibbs](http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/katharine-gibbs-invents-modern-professional-secretary/) schools, “the Harvard of secretarial education.”  
凯瑟琳吉布斯学校，“秘书教育的哈佛”。

Training for high paid secretarial roles in the mid-20th century was rigorous: a fifty hours-per-week workload to learn typewriting, stenography, business and social correspondence, organizational systems (office filing, business archives, inventory management, taxes), budgeting and finance, and social conventions.  
20 世纪中叶，高薪秘书职位的培训非常严格：每周 50 小时的工作量，用于学习打字、速记、商业和社会信函、组织系统（办公室归档、商业档案、库存管理、税收）、预算编制以及金融和社会习俗。  
Top secretaries were expected to understand municipal administration, the relationship of business to government, local party politics. Cultural competence was critical.  
高级秘书需要了解市政管理、企业与政府的关系、地方政党政治。文化能力至关重要。  
Art and music appreciation classes were required, as well as English literature (and grammar), and tasteful behavior (how to adjust a hat, how to greet guests, how to hold a cocktail in a crowded room).  
需要艺术和音乐欣赏课程，以及英语文学（和语法）和有品位的行为（如何调整帽子，如何问候客人，如何在拥挤的房间里举行鸡尾酒会）。

Secretarial jobs propelled millions of 20th century women into financial independence, whether they spent their career in the role or advanced into management or executive positions.  
秘书工作推动了 20 世纪数百万女性实现经济独立，无论她们是在这个职位上度过自己的职业生涯，还是晋升到管理或行政职位。

I have been thinking about the “keeper of secrets” aspect of the old-school secretary now that [_ChatGPT_](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/)  
_ChatGPT_ 之后，我一直在思考老式秘书的“保密”方面 is being touted as the final answer to a cheap, reliable assistant available to all, from job seeker to CEO. Indeed, _ChatGPT_ is a kind of assistant, the way Google is, but let’s separate the assisting tasks from the assistant position, which is, still, woefully low paid.  
被吹捧为廉价、可靠的助手的最终答案，从求职者到首席执行官，所有人都可以使用。确实，_ChatGPT_ 是一种助手，就像谷歌一样，但让我们将辅助任务与助理职位分开，助理职位的薪水仍然低得可怜。  
The general idea is: why hire a person when you’ve got an answer machine in your pocket? Not only is _ChatGPT_ cheaper (even when it stops being free) but the very concept of ‘assistant’ is vexed, particularly among  
总的想法是：当你口袋里有答录机时，为什么要雇用一个人呢？ _ChatGPT_ 不仅更便宜（即使它不再免费），而且“助手”的概念本身也令人烦恼，尤其是在[assertive Gen-Z and Millennial](https://www.fastcompany.com/90817046/millennial-gen-z-women-more-likely-to-demand-workplace-pay-raises-promotions) women who are expecting to start at the top.  
自信的 Z 世代和千禧一代女性，她们希望从高层开始。

And yet I predict that _ChatGPT_ is going to drive a comeback of the “keeper of secrets” role, paid well to screens calls and emails, who will make whoever can afford a good secretary much more efficient.  
然而，我预测 _ChatGPT_ 将推动“保密”角色的卷土重来，支付高薪来屏蔽电话和电子邮件，这将使任何能负担得起好秘书的人更有效率。  
If you’re in a role of any importance, you’re going to be flooded with AI-written communication, much of which will be incorrect. You’re going to need to hire someone with a head of their shoulders to sort through it.  
如果你担任任何重要的角色，你都会被 AI 编写的通信淹没，其中大部分都是不正确的。您将需要雇用一个有头脑的人来整理它。  
Why not a secretary, if a culture shift could bring back both the job and title?  
如果文化转变可以带回工作和头衔，为什么不是秘书呢？

Second wave feminism is partly to blame for the scorn of the secretarial role by ambitious women. In 1971 Gloria Steinem offered the worst possible advice ever [given](https://alumnae.smith.edu/smithcms/1971/files/2015/08/Steinem-Commencement-Address.pdf) to Smith College graduates: “perhaps a whole generation of us should fail to learn how to type.” With the doors of top universities, law schools, medical schools, and business schools finally opened to women, the secretarial role was sadly disposable.    
第二波女权主义在一定程度上要归咎于雄心勃勃的女性对秘书角色的蔑视。 1971 年，格洛丽亚·斯泰纳姆 (Gloria Steinem) 向史密斯学院的毕业生提出了有史以来最糟糕的建议：“也许我们这一代人都应该学不会打字。”随着顶尖大学、法学院、医学院和商学院的大门终于向女性敞开，可悲的是，秘书的角色被抛弃了。

Steinem could not know that in just a few years, most professionals would become their own secretaries, as email and the internet, Expedia, OpenTable, Google Docs, Google Calendar, and TurboTax meant that you would be typing your own correspondence, keeping your own calendar, keeping track of your own documents, making your own lunch, dinner, and travel reservations.  
Steinem 不知道在短短几年内，大多数专业人士将成为他们自己的秘书，因为电子邮件和互联网、Expedia、OpenTable、Google Docs、Google Calendar 和 TurboTax 意味着您将输入自己的信件，保留自己的日历，跟踪您自己的文件，自己做午餐、晚餐和旅行预订。  
We all self-secretary now. Most of us do it badly, particularly when it comes to filing, which most people don’t do at all.  
我们现在都是自我秘书。我们大多数人都做得不好，尤其是在归档方面，大多数人根本不这样做。  
A thousand software companies bloom every year with personal assistant apps for email, note-taking, personal and office filing systems and document databases.  
每年都有一千家软件公司蓬勃发展，其个人助理应用程序用于电子邮件、笔记、个人和办公文件系统以及文档数据库。  
I know people in their thirties who have never owned a filing cabinet and who keep tax records as email attachments in the cloud.  
我认识一些三十多岁的人，他们从未拥有过文件柜，并且将税务记录作为电子邮件附件保存在云端。

Getting rid of ‘the secretary’ as both a person and portfolio of responsibilities has been bad for everyone. Imagine how productive you would be if you had beside you an entity (let’s say an individual) with the following functionality:  
摆脱“秘书”作为个人和责任组合对每个人都不利。想象一下，如果您身边有一个具有以下功能的实体（假设是个人），您的工作效率会是多少：

-   Reviews and processes 90% of your email;  
    审查和处理 90% 的电子邮件；
    
-   Has a working relationship with all of your colleagues, your direct reports, your customers, your external stakeholders, and your immediate family;  
    与你的所有同事、你的直接下属、你的客户、你的外部利益相关者和你的直系亲属保持工作关系；
    
-   Embodies and models organizational norms and culture: intensity (high or low), formality (high or low), professionalism (presumably high).  
    体现和塑造组织规范和文化：强度（高或低）、形式（高或低）、专业性（大概高）。
    
-   Organizes/files all correspondence and key documents methodically;  
    有条不紊地组织/归档所有信件和关键文件；
    
-   Organizes and rearranges your calendar according to changing priorities;  
    根据不断变化的优先级组织和重新安排您的日历；
    
-   Tactfully communicates delays, postponements, cancellation of meetings;  
    巧妙地传达延迟、推迟、取消会议；
    
-   Ensures your preferences in travel, accommodation, entertainment, dining;  
    确保您在旅行、住宿、娱乐、餐饮方面的偏好；
    
-   Remembers birthdays and anniversaries; suggests gifts;  
    记住生日和纪念日；建议礼物；
    
-   Serves as a sounding board; advises caution when appropriate;  
    充当共鸣板；在适当的时候建议谨慎；
    
-   Keeps secrets. 保守秘密。
    

One of my first jobs out of college in the 1980s, secretary to the liquor sales advertising executive at _The New Yorker_  
我 1980 年代大学毕业后的第一份工作之一，是《纽约客》酒类销售广告主管的秘书 magazine, taught me more about how the world works (and how the magazine business worked) than most of my college education.  
杂志，比我的大部分大学教育更让我了解世界是如何运作的（以及杂志业务是如何运作的）。  
My boss was courtly, exacting about which table he wanted at particular New York restaurants, wryly generous regarding the birthdays of ex-wives, and fantastic at his job. While I kept meticulous account files, the details were also in his head.  
我的老板彬彬有礼，严格要求他在纽约特定餐厅要哪张桌子，对前妻的生日大方，并且对他的工作非常满意。在我精心保管账目档案的同时，细节也在他的脑海中。  
When I would pull up comparisons for him, it was for confirmation of his own memory and to tell stories about how to “upsell” a client and when. But if he had suddenly vanished, the records would remain, perfectly organized, in the files.  
当我为他进行比较时，是为了确认他自己的记忆，并讲述有关如何“追加销售”客户以及何时“追加销售”的故事。但如果他突然消失了，这些记录就会完整地保存在档案中。

Before the pandemic, there was a [spate](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-vanishing-executive-assistant-11579323605) of [think](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/administrative-assistant-jobs-helped-propel-many-women-into-the-middle-class-now-theyre-disappearing/2019/12/04/75686efe-f6a0-11e9-a285-882a8e386a96_story.html)  
大流行之前，有很多想法 pieces about the role of the office support staff: about the vanishing executive assistant, and low-paid and beleaguered assistants.  
关于办公室支持人员角色的文章：关于消失的行政助理，以及低薪和陷入困境的助理。  
Loss of information flow and loss of culture have been the biggest reported casualties of a fragmented work force, as colleagues were separated and isolated in their home offices.  
信息流的流失和文化的流失是支离破碎的劳动力据报道的最大伤亡，因为同事们在他们的家庭办公室中被分开和隔离。  
As we rethink and rebuild office culture, it’s worth considering how self-secretarying contributed to office fragmentation long before remote work.  
当我们重新思考和重建办公室文化时，值得考虑的是，早在远程工作之前，自我秘书是如何导致办公室碎片化的。  
The old-school secretary role is in fact essential to information flow and establishing cultural and professional norms—even in a virtual workspace—not to mention serving as a productivity multiplier and a training ground for future managers and leaders.  
事实上，传统的秘书角色对于信息流动和建立文化和专业规范至关重要——即使是在虚拟工作空间中——更不用说作为生产力倍增器和未来经理和领导者的培训基地。  
A good secretary will use _ChatGPT_ to help manage information flow but will focus most working hours tasks that are unique to each leader – the highly specialized tasks, including sensitive correspondence, that generalized intelligence can’t accomplish.  
一位优秀的秘书会使用 _ChatGPT_ 来帮助管理信息流，但会专注于大多数工作时间的任务，这些任务对每个领导来说都是独一无二的——高度专业化的任务，包括敏感的信件，这是通用智能无法完成的。  
Everyone wants a secretary so competent that if you say “get me a live elephant for the board meeting this afternoon” you will get an elephant (with guidance from a chatbot on the best vendors), but who also might say to you, “really? Is that really a good idea?”  
每个人都想要一位如此能干的秘书，以至于如果你说“今天下午的董事会会议上给我一头活的大象”，你就会得到一头大象（在聊天机器人对最佳供应商的指导下），但谁也可能会对你说，“真的？这真的是个好主意吗？”

The mid-20th century Gibbs training speaks to the competence, intelligence, and cultivation expected of top secretaries as well as the indispensable role secretaries played in the companies that hired them, which was simultaneously to keep an organization productive and human.  
20 世纪中叶的吉布斯培训谈到了高级秘书的能力、智慧和修养，以及秘书在雇用他们的公司中扮演的不可或缺的角色，同时保持组织的生产力和人性化。  
Good secretaries are repositories of information and enablers of backchannel communications.  
好的秘书是信息的储存库和秘密渠道沟通的推动者。  
Secretaries know where the files are, where there is an extra five minutes on a calendar, when brusqueness is not targeted at you but rather indicates anxiety about a sick child or indigestion, how and when to reschedule a meeting and how and when to smooth rough waters.  
秘书知道文件在哪里，日历上哪里有额外的五分钟，什么时候粗鲁不是针对你而是表示对生病的孩子或消化不良的焦虑，如何以及何时重新安排会议以及如何以及何时平息粗糙水域。  
One can’t imagine this sort of secretary working for Sam Bankman-Fried at FTX. This absence might have been an early warning sign in an era where one expects a CEO to have a highly competent personal gatekeeper.  
人们无法想象这样一位秘书会在 FTX 为 Sam Bankman-Fried 工作。在这个人们期望 CEO 拥有非常称职的个人看门人的时代，这种缺席可能是一个预警信号。

The secretary as confidential advisor has never had a place on organizational charts. The secretary’s purely functional role began to fragment with advances in telephone and computer technology and the copy machine. With the exception of Rosabeth Moss Kantor’s _Men and Women of the Corporation_ (1977), which spends a chapter characterizing secretarial power as “patrimony,” organizational theory and management books from Douglas McGregor’s _The Human Side of Enterprise_ (1960) onward ignore the role or, in the case of Robert Townsend’s _Up the Organization_ (1970), argue for doing without staff altogether. Clerical tasks that could be replaced by automation _should_ be replaced, in large organizations and small. The trend played out on television. While Perry Mason (1957-1966) was supported by Della Street and Joe Mannix (1967-75) by Peggy Fair, in 1974, _[The Rockford Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SijxE8S6wYQ)_ opened with an answering machine. Jim Rockford worked alone.  
作为机密顾问的秘书从未在组织结构图上占有一席之地。随着电话、计算机技术和复印机的进步，秘书的纯粹职能角色开始分崩离析。除了罗莎贝丝·莫斯·坎特 (Rosabeth Moss Kantor) 的《公司的男人和女人》(1977)，该书用一章将秘书权力描述为“遗产”，道格拉斯·麦格雷戈 (Douglas McGregor) 的《企业的人性方面》(1960) 之后的组织理论和管理书籍忽略了秘书权力的作用或，在罗伯特·汤森 (Robert Townsend) 的《提升组织》(Up the Organization, 1970) 的案例中，主张完全没有员工。在大型组织和小型组织中，可以被自动化取代的文书工作应该被取代。这种趋势在电视上播出。虽然 Perry Mason（1957-1966）得到 Della Street 的支持，Joe Mannix（1967-75）得到 Peggy Fair 的支持，但在 1974 年，The Rockford Files 以答录机打开。吉姆罗克福德独自工作。

How much more productive would you be with a good secretary? Consider an executive earning $1.5 million per year.  
如果有一位好秘书，您的工作效率会提高多少？考虑一位年收入 150 万美元的高管。  
A secretary earning $120,000 who works for one executive alone needs to save that boss only 5 hours of a 60-hour work week (8% more productive) to make the numbers work. As Melba J. Duncan  
一位年薪 120,000 美元的秘书只为一位高管工作，每周工作 60 小时，只需要为这位老板节省 5 小时（生产率提高 8%），就可以让这些数字发挥作用。作为梅尔巴·J·邓肯[argued](https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-case-for-executive-assistants) almost a decade ago in the _Harvard Business_ _Review_  
大约十年前在《哈佛商业评论》上争论过, a good executive assistant will more than make up that deficit. The key tasks? Managing a schedule, triaging email, organizing files, overseeing workflow, and perhaps the most time-saving function of all: taking dictation (throw out those terrible voice apps).  
，一个好的行政助理将弥补这一不足。关键任务？管理日程、分类电子邮件、组织文件、监督工作流程，也许还有最省时的功能：听写（扔掉那些糟糕的语音应用程序）。  
There are also the harder-to-define tasks, like maintaining a general sense of order during a stressful week or managing the little things that can chip away at an executive’s time and focus.  
还有一些更难定义的任务，比如在充满压力的一周内保持总体秩序感，或者管理可能占用高管时间和注意力的小事。

What does the secretary get out of this role? Does the job provide a real springboard for leadership, or is it fulfilling in and of itself? Both.  
秘书从这个角色中得到了什么？这份工作是否为领导力提供了真正的跳板，或者它本身是否令人满意？两个都。  
For a young Michael Ovitz, founder of Creative Artists Agency, working as an assistant to a top executive at the William Morris agency in the 1960s, with unhindered access to the corporate files, the secretarial role was foundational for his future success.    
对于 Creative Artists Agency 的创始人迈克尔·奥维茨 (Michael Ovitz) 来说，他在 1960 年代担任 William Morris 经纪公司一位高级管理人员的助理，可以不受阻碍地访问公司文件，秘书的角色是他未来成功的基础。

Like many in higher education leadership, I’m concerned about _ChatGPT_ but I’m more concerned about student readiness, the decline of corporate training programs, and the general economic future for college graduates, particularly in the humanities.  
与许多高等教育领导层一样，我担心 _ChatGPT_，但我更关心学生的准备情况、企业培训计划的减少以及大学毕业生的总体经济前景，尤其是在人文学科领域。  
I wonder about the role colleges and universities could play in training students to practice skills that AI can’t deliver and that employers value—how to show up early, how to deliver bad news, how to give and accept criticism, how to deal with an office visitor the team leader does not want to see, how not to be flaky, how to organize files, how to handle confidential information, and most importantly, how to write and answer emails promptly, swiftly, briefly, and with tact.  
我想知道学院和大学在培训学生实践人工智能无法提供但雇主看重的技能方面可以发挥什么作用——如何早点出现，如何传递坏消息，如何给予和接受批评，如何处理团队领导不想看到的办公室访客，如何不古怪，如何组织文件，如何处理机密信息，最重要的是，如何及时、迅速、简短、机智地撰写和回复电子邮件。

These skills cannot be automated, cannot be outsourced, and may provide a competitive edge to businesses that value them. The first step is to put the position on the org chart and value it.  
这些技能不能自动化，不能外包，并且可以为重视它们的企业提供竞争优势。第一步是将职位放在组织结构图上并对其进行估价。

The idea of posting a job ad for a “secretary” sounds comically old-fashioned, potentially embarrassing for both the employer and the applicant.  
为“秘书”发布招聘广告的想法听起来有点过时，可能会让雇主和求职者都感到尴尬。  
A snappy new name—enterprise administrator, management apprentice, organizational attaché—would undoubtedly make the role more appealing. But to be the person literally entrusted with secrets seems fundamentally more accurate to the role.    
一个活泼的新名字——企业管理员、管理学徒、组织专员——无疑会使这个角色更具吸引力。但从根本上说，成为真正被赋予秘密的人似乎更适合这个角色。
