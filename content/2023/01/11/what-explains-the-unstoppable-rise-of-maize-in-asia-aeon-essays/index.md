Maize is arguably the single most important crop in the world and is rivalled only by soybeans in terms of versatility. That said, it is, along with sugar cane and palm oil, among the most controversial crops, proving particularly so to critics of industrial agriculture. Although maize is usually associated with the Western world, it has played a prominent role in Asia for a long time, and, in recent decades, its importance in Asia has soared. For better or worse, or more likely for better _and_ worse, its role in Asia seems to be following the Western script.

玉米可以说是世界上最重要的单一作物，在多功能性方面仅次于大豆。也就是说，它与甘蔗和棕榈油一样，是最具争议的作物之一，对工业化农业的批评者来说尤其如此。尽管玉米通常与西方世界联系在一起，但它在亚洲长期发挥着重要作用，而且近几十年来，它在亚洲的重要性飙升。不管是好是坏，或者更有可能是好是坏，它在亚洲的角色似乎都在遵循西方的剧本。

When one thinks of food and foodways in Asia, it is hard to avoid the subject of rice. For good reason, too: rice for millennia has been _primus inter pares_ among the continent’s sources of food. Not for nothing is rice known in India as _dhanya_, meaning sustainer of the human race. Another illustration – in some ways even more vivid – is that, in traditional China, a common (and polite) way of saying hello was via the idiomatic expression ‘Have you eaten your rice today?’ And, speaking of China, one can’t spend much time there without hearing someone talk about their pursuit of a career with the promise of an ‘iron rice bowl’ – ie, guaranteed job security. In other words, rice [rules](https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/98/4/1050/126995?redirectedFrom=fulltext).

当人们想到亚洲的食物和饮食方式时，很难避免米饭这个话题。也有充分的理由：几千年来，大米一直是非洲大陆食物来源中的首选。大米在印度被称为 dhanya，意为人类的维持者，这并非无缘无故。另一个例子——在某些方面甚至更生动——是，在传统中国，一种常见的（礼貌的）打招呼方式是通过惯用语表达“你今天吃米饭了吗？”而且，说到中国，一个人可以“在那里呆了很长时间，都会听到有人谈论他们对“铁饭碗”承诺的职业追求——即有保障的工作保障。换句话说，大米统治。

Not so fast, though. Although rice may be _numero uno_ in Asia, we’ve long known that other cultigens – indeed other foods, more broadly – have played prominent roles there as well. Fish and seafood constitute hugely important sources of protein in much of Asia, and cereal grains such as wheat, millet and, to a lesser extent, oats provide sustenance to large numbers in various parts of Asia, and have done so for long periods of time. Legumes (including soybeans) are important virtually everywhere in Asia, as are other vegetables and fruits, and [taro](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/taro) and breadfruit have their places, too.

不过没那么快。尽管大米在亚洲可能是数不胜数，但我们早就知道其他栽培种——实际上是其他食物，更广泛地说——也在那里发挥了重要作用。鱼和海产品是亚洲大部分地区极其重要的蛋白质来源，而小麦、小米和较小程度上的燕麦等谷物为亚洲各地的大量人口提供食物，而且长期以来一直如此.豆类（包括大豆）在亚洲几乎无处不在，其他蔬菜和水果也是如此，芋头和面包果也占有一席之地。

Moreover, ever since the onset of the [so-called](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.24.2.163) Columbian Exchange in the late 15th century, ‘New World’ crops from the Western hemisphere have been part of the mix, in certain areas profoundly influencing and enriching Asian diets, agricultural production patterns and foodways. Numerous legumes from the Americas, for example, were adopted in various parts of Asia, as were vegetables and fruits such as squashes of various kinds, pumpkin, papaya, guava, avocado, tomatoes, pineapples, [cocoa](https://aeon.co/essays/how-chocolate-went-from-exotic-curiosity-to-worldwide-commodity) and, of course, [chili peppers](https://aeon.co/essays/what-kind-of-masochists-want-to-burn-their-mouths-off) (fruit of plants from the genus _Capsicum_), without the last of which meals in many parts of Asia simply cannot do. More important still – in a caloric sense at least – have been the roles of American cultigens such as peanuts, manioc, Irish potatoes and sweet potatoes, the last two of which became indispensable dietary mainstays in numerous Asian countries, along with one other cultigen, the cereal [maize](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/zea-mays) (_Zea mays_), my principal focus of attention here.

此外，自 15 世纪后期所谓的哥伦布交流开始以来，来自西半球的“新世界”作物一直是其中的一部分，在某些地区深刻影响和丰富了亚洲人的饮食、农业生产模式和饮食方式.例如，许多来自美洲的豆类被亚洲各地采用，蔬菜和水果也是如此，例如各种南瓜、南瓜、木瓜、番石榴、鳄梨、西红柿、菠萝、可可，当然还有辣椒（辣椒属植物的果实），没有最后一种，亚洲许多地方的饭菜根本做不到。更重要的是——至少在热量方面——美国栽培品种的作用，如花生、木薯、爱尔兰土豆和红薯，其中后两种与另一种栽培品种一起成为许多亚洲国家不可或缺的饮食支柱，谷类玉米 (Zea mays)，我在这里关注的主要焦点。

Maize was introduced to Asia early in the Columbian Exchange by various means and sundry groups – merchants, military forces, adventurers, freebooters and the like. Use and production of the cereal grain spread quickly. By the middle of the 16th century, maize was grown extensively in parts of China and, before 1700, in India, with the cereal grain eaten (and otherwise employed) in a variety of ways in both areas. The Portuguese likely introduced maize to both China and India, but the Spanish and the Dutch were also involved in the transmission process in Asia, the Philippines and what is now Indonesia in particular.

在哥伦比亚交易所早期，艾兹通过各种方式和各种各样的团体——商人、军队、冒险家、劫匪等——被引入亚洲。谷物的使用和生产迅速传播开来。到 16 世纪中叶，玉米在中国部分地区广泛种植，1700 年之前在印度种植，谷物在这两个地区的食用（和其他用途）方式各不相同。葡萄牙人可能将玉米引入中国和印度，但西班牙人和荷兰人也参与了亚洲、菲律宾和现在的印度尼西亚的传播过程。

Over the centuries, maize has [become](https://www.ipipotash.org/publications/eifc-92) increasingly important in both absolute and relative terms in many parts of Asia, although the scale of its importance has seldom been fully appreciated. In 2019, about one-third of the world’s maize was [grown](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12571-022-01288-7) in Asia, up from less than 17 per cent 40 years earlier. Who knew? Perhaps even more surprising is the fact that, for the past decade, maize has been China’s [leading](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1198896/china-grain-crop-production-volume-by-main-crop/) cereal grain, with production [outpacing](http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/PressRelease/202112/t20211207_1825086.html) both rice and wheat, the great staples generally associated with China. And that is hardly the only nation-state in Asia where maize production is of major significance. While China was the world’s second largest producer of maize – behind only the [United States](https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/digital/king-corn/) – in 2019, other Asian countries also [ranked](https://www.nationmaster.com/nmx/ranking/maize-production) among the world’s largest producers, with Indonesia sixth, India seventh, the Philippines 17th, Pakistan 20th, and Vietnam 25th, just ahead of Thailand in 26th place. The importance of rice production notwithstanding, maize, clearly, is no curio or oddment in Asia, and demands a closer, properly historicised and contextualised look.

几个世纪以来，玉米在亚洲许多地区的绝对和相对价值都变得越来越重要，尽管其重要性的规模很少得到充分认识。 2019 年，世界上约三分之一的玉米产自亚洲，高于 40 年前的不到 17%。谁知道？或许更令人惊讶的是，在过去十年中，玉米一直是中国的主要谷物，产量超过水稻和小麦，而水稻和小麦通常与中国联系在一起。这并不是亚洲唯一一个玉米生产具有重要意义的民族国家。虽然中国在 2019 年是世界第二大玉米生产国——仅次于美国——但其他亚洲国家也跻身世界最大生产国行列，其中印度尼西亚第六、印度第七、菲律宾第 17、巴基斯坦第 20 和越南第 25，仅泰国排名第 26 位。尽管水稻生产很重要，但玉米在亚洲显然不是稀奇古怪的东西，需要更仔细、适当地历史化和背景化地看待。

You name the food or product, and it likely includes maize in some form  
您为食物或产品命名，它可能包括某种形式的玉米  

Maize is today the world’s [second](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1003455/most-produced-crops-and-livestock-products-worldwide/) leading crop of any kind in terms of total production, behind only sugar cane, and the [leading](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263977/world-grain-production-by-type/) cereal grain produced by a wide margin. Moreover, production has grown rapidly in recent decades, with world maize output tripling between [1982](https://www.fao.org/3/ap662e/ap662e.pdf) and [2019](https://www.fao.org/3/cb4476en/cb4476en.pdf). In 2019, global maize production reached 1,148,487 billion metric tons, while the totals for wheat and rice production each came to about two-thirds of the level for maize in 2019, with wheat at 765,770 million metric tons, and paddy rice at 755,474 million metric tons.

就总产量而言，玉米是当今世界第二大作物，仅次于甘蔗，并且是遥遥领先的主要谷类作物。此外，近几十年来产量增长迅速，世界玉米产量在 1982 年至 2019 年间增长了两倍。 2019年全球玉米总产量达11484870亿吨，小麦和水稻总产量各为2019年玉米产量的三分之二左右，其中小麦7657.7亿吨，水稻7554.74亿吨吨。

The prominence of maize among cereal grains is readily understandable, for it has numerous advantages on both the supply and demand sides. Regarding supply considerations: maize [possesses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8436073/) great genetic variability and is readily adaptable to a variety of climatic conditions, whether temperate or tropical; it can be grown on a wide range of soil types and on soil of poor quality; its growing season, generally speaking, is fairly short; it is less labour- and water-intensive than rice; and, as a so-called C4 plant, it fixes nitrogen more efficiently than do C3 cereals such as rice and wheat. In Asia, it is often [grown](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016722002340) in hilly upland areas unsuitable for many other crops. In Southeast Asia and East Asia, 80 per cent of the maize grown is rain-fed, without the benefit of irrigation, although in some areas it is grown on irrigated paddy fields after the rice harvest.

玉米在谷物中的突出地位是可以理解的，因为它在供需双方都有许多优势。关于供应方面的考虑：玉米具有很大的遗传变异性，很容易适应各种气候条件，无论是温带还是热带；它可以在各种土壤类型和质量差的土壤上生长；一般来说，它的生长季节很短；与大米相比，它的劳动力和水密集度较低；而且，作为所谓的 C4 植物，它比水稻和小麦等 C3 谷物更有效地固氮。在亚洲，它通常生长在不适合许多其他作物的丘陵高地地区。在东南亚和东亚，80% 的玉米种植是靠雨养的，没有灌溉的好处，尽管在一些地区，玉米是在水稻收获后在灌溉稻田上种植的。

Turning to the demand side: no cereal grain is more versatile than maize, which can be employed efficiently, effectively and, more to the point, profitably in a huge variety of ways. Indeed, its multifarious uses and elusive, often cloaked identity render maize the quintessential postmodern crop. Not only does it ‘fuel’ humans and their stocks of animals, but also, when converted into the chemical compound [ethanol](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-68922-5_23), the vehicles they drive. When converted into either sugar and syrup (or dextrose, which is chemically indistinguishable from glucose) or corn starch (dextrin), it finds its way – often at an intermediate stage – into a vast array of processed foods and finished products encountered in daily life. You name the food or product, and it likely includes maize in some form – product categories such as paint, textiles, wallpaper, soap, candles, newspapers, cigarettes, insecticides, dry batteries, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, plastic, nitroglycerin and fireworks, shoe polish and ceiling tiles, to name just a few. As a result, maize, along with soybeans and palm oil, is rightfully [considered](https://www.halacsolcha.org/index.php/halac/article/view/435) a ‘flex’ crop par excellence. Little wonder, then, that the demand for maize in whatever form has become ubiquitous, and maize production is increasingly pervasive all around the world, including in Asia.

谈到需求方面：没有一种谷物比玉米更通用，可以高效、有效地使用，更重要的是，可以通过多种方式获利。事实上，它的多种用途和难以捉摸的、经常隐藏的身份使玉米成为典型的后现代作物。它不仅为人类和他们的动物提供“燃料”，而且在转化为化合物乙醇后，还为他们驾驶的车辆提供燃料。当转化为糖和糖浆（或葡萄糖，在化学上与葡萄糖无法区分）或玉米淀粉（糊精）时，它通常会在中间阶段找到自己的方式进入日常生活中遇到的大量加工食品和成品.你给食物或产品命名，它可能包括某种形式的玉米——产品类别，如油漆、纺织品、墙纸、肥皂、蜡烛、报纸、香烟、杀虫剂、干电池、化妆品、药品、塑料、硝化甘油和烟花、鞋抛光和天花板瓷砖，仅举几例。因此，玉米与大豆和棕榈油一起被理所当然地认为是一种卓越的“灵活”作物。难怪对各种形式的玉米的需求变得无处不在，玉米生产在世界各地越来越普遍，包括在亚洲。

Until relatively recently, the vast majority of the maize produced in Asia was used for human consumption. In this regard, Thailand was a notable exception. Significant production of maize began later in Thailand than in most other parts of Asia and, unlike these other areas, much of the maize produced in Thailand was used as animal feed even early on. When employed for human consumption in Asia, maize found many uses, sometimes as a staple – particularly among the poor in hilly areas – but also as a versatile dietary supplement or complement, which could be eaten after roasting or grilling (often as a snack), ground into flour and thence used in gruels, noodles, cakes, buns, etc, or employed as an ingredient in soups, desserts, or in Korea as ‘tea’. Maize is also used in various alcoholic beverages in Asia, such as the corn-based _baijiu_ in China, Vietnamese corn wine, and a number of alcoholic beverages distilled from maize in Darjeeling, Sikkim and other parts of India.

直到最近，亚洲生产的绝大多数玉米都用于人类消费。在这方面，泰国是一个明显的例外。与亚洲其他大部分地区相比，泰国开始大量生产玉米的时间较晚，而且与其他地区不同的是，泰国生产的许多玉米甚至很早就被用作动物饲料。在亚洲用于人类消费时，玉米有许多用途，有时作为主食——尤其是在山区的穷人中——但也作为一种多功能的膳食补充剂或补充剂，可以在烘烤或烧烤后食用（通常作为零食） ，磨成面粉，然后用于稀饭、面条、蛋糕、面包等，或用作汤、甜点的成分，或在韩国称为“茶”。玉米还用于亚洲的各种酒精饮料，例如中国的玉米白酒、越南的玉米酒，以及大吉岭、锡金和印度其他地区的一些玉米蒸馏酒。

How things have changed. Since the 1980s – even earlier in some areas – the uses to which corn is put in Asia have shifted dramatically. Whereas until then most of the corn produced in Asia was intended for family consumption, for feeding animals on site, or for sale at local or regional markets, today the greatest proportion of corn production by far is used as animal feed, often for agribusiness livestock aggregators, particularly those raising and processing chickens and hogs, and those raising stock for the production of eggs and dairy products. Another large component of the corn crop in Asia is used to [produce](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12571-021-01212-5) bioethanol. Moreover, these two uses help to explain why Asia imports a great deal of maize from other parts of the world, and why it exports relatively little. In 2019, for example, Asian countries imported 78,240.2 million tons of maize – more than 43 per cent of the world’s total – while exporting only 2,629.8 million tons, or a little over 1.4 per cent. In this regard, the fact that most of the maize produced in Asia is still grown on small, relatively inefficient units, and the fact that yields and overall productivity are much lower than in the most advanced producing areas – the US, most notably – should be noted, for they help to explain the prominent role of maize imports into Asia.

事情发生了怎样的变化。自 20 世纪 80 年代以来——在某些地区甚至更早——亚洲玉米的用途发生了巨大变化。在此之前，亚洲生产的大部分玉米用于家庭消费、现场喂养动物或在当地或区域市场销售，而今天，迄今为止最大比例的玉米产量被用作动物饲料，通常用于农业综合企业的牲畜聚合商，特别是那些饲养和加工鸡和猪，以及为生产鸡蛋和乳制品而饲养牲畜的聚合商。亚洲玉米作物的另一大部分用于生产生物乙醇。此外，这两种用途有助于解释为什么亚洲从世界其他地区进口大量玉米，而出口相对较少。例如，2019 年，亚洲国家进口了 782.402 亿吨玉米，占世界总量的 43% 以上，而出口量仅为 26.298 亿吨，略高于 1.4%。在这方面，亚洲生产的大部分玉米仍然种植在小型、相对低效的单位上，而且产量和整体生产率远低于最先进的产区——尤其是美国——这一事实应该请注意，因为它们有助于解释玉米进口到亚洲的突出作用。

China has been buying into or buying up foreign meat processors  
中国一直在收购或收购外国肉类加工商  

To understand how and why these changes came about, we must embed maize in the larger narrative of Asia’s relative rise, its will to power, as it were, in recent decades, for Asia’s rapid economic growth and development over the past half century have had profound effects on, and implications for, maize production and consumption. Asia’s population growth alone during this period meant that – _ceteris paribus_ – demand for foodstuffs of all types, including maize, would likely rise. But two other factors – rising per-capita income and rapid urbanisation – have [reshaped](https://www.oecd.org/regional/regional-policy/Urban-GG-Dynamic-Asia-report.pdf) demand for corn more specifically. With income per capita rising all over Asia, demand [increased](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378021001229) for foods of higher income-elasticities – meat and dairy products in particular – which greatly increased demand for animal feeds, most notably, soybeans and maize.

要理解这些变化是如何发生的以及为什么会发生，我们必须将玉米纳入亚洲相对崛起的更大叙事中，它的权力意志，就像最近几十年一样，因为亚洲在过去半个世纪的快速经济增长和发展已经对玉米生产和消费的深远影响和影响。在此期间仅亚洲的人口增长就意味着——其他条件不变——对包括玉米在内的所有类型食品的需求可能会上升。但另外两个因素——人均收入增加和快速城市化——更具体地改变了对玉米的需求。随着整个亚洲人均收入的增加，对收入弹性较高的食品（尤其是肉类和奶制品）的需求增加，这大大增加了对动物饲料的需求，尤其是大豆和玉米。

Nowhere have these changes been more powerful than in China, which has not only been maintaining a ‘strategic pork reserve’ for some time now, but also promoting farm consolidation at home in hopes of creating scale economies – thereby enhancing productive efficiency – and building large-scale ‘industrial’ meat-processing facilities. Nor is that all: China has been [contracting](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/outlooks/93390/ocs-19f-01.pdf) with countries such as Brazil and the US for huge amounts of corn and soybeans, and buying into or buying up foreign meat processors, a notable case in point being the acquisition in 2013 of the Virginia-based Smithfield Foods, the world’s largest hog processor, by the WH Group (then known as Shuanghui International).

这些变化在中国最为强烈，中国不仅一段时间以来一直在维持“战略猪肉储备”，而且还在推动国内农场整合，以期创造规模经济——从而提高生产效率——并建立大型-规模“工业”肉类加工设施。这还不是全部：中国一直在与巴西和美国等国家签订大量玉米和大豆合同，并收购或收购外国肉类加工商，一个值得注意的例子是 2013 年收购总部位于弗吉尼亚的万洲国际（当时称为双汇国际）旗下全球最大的生猪加工商史密斯菲尔德食品公司。

The same development-inspired income gains that changed food demand in Asia have also raised demand for corn-based bioethanol to power motor vehicles in the region, as well as demand for a wide range of manufactured products that make use of corn or corn byproducts in the production process. With rapid urbanisation and, moreover, rising living standards, Asia witnessed a [makeover](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12571-021-01182-8) of its food-processing and distribution systems, which makeover included the rise of supermarkets and hypermarkets stocked with meat products – poultry, pork, beef, etc – and eggs and milk products dependent, in large part, on maize as feed. This makeover has extended even to forlorn Myanmar, where supermarkets and hypermarkets have sprung up, the City Mart Supermarkets in Yangon and Mandalay, most notably. The makeover, moreover, has been underpinned and often overseen by large agribusiness concerns, both Western agribusiness multinationals such as Cargill, ADM and the Louis Dreyfus Company, and Asian-based competitors such as the CP Group, Olam, Wilmar and COFCO, all of which have played major roles in the acquisition, processing and marketing of maize and maize products.

发展带来的收入增长改变了亚洲的食品需求，这也增加了该地区对以玉米为基础的生物乙醇为机动车提供动力的需求，以及对利用玉米或玉米副产品的各种制成品的需求。生产过程。随着快速城市化以及生活水平的提高，亚洲见证了其食品加工和分销系统的改造，其中包括超市和大卖场的兴起，这些超市和大卖场出售肉类产品——家禽、猪肉、牛肉等——以及鸡蛋和牛奶产品在很大程度上依赖玉米作为饲料。这种改造甚至延伸到了荒凉的缅甸，那里的超市和大卖场如雨后春笋般涌现，最著名的是仰光和曼德勒的 City Mart 超市。此外，这种改造得到了大型农业综合企业的支持和监督，包括嘉吉、ADM 和 Louis Dreyfus 公司等西方农业综合企业跨国公司，以及正大集团、奥兰、丰益国际和中粮集团等亚洲竞争对手。在玉米和玉米产品的收购、加工和销售方面发挥了重要作用。

Although it is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future (as noted by the Danish physicist Niels Bohr, among others), most knowledgeable observers believe that the role of maize in Asia will continue to grow in the coming decades, because the underlying trends responsible for its ascent – rising income per capita and urbanisation especially, but increasingly farm consolidation too – continue apace. To be sure, considerations such as climate change, innovations in food technology, and possible shifts in foodways and even agriculture/food regimes might disrupt and even reverse secular trends and thus demand for maize in Asia. But, for the foreseeable future, chances of such disruptions, much less reversals, seem slim, and the future for maize in Asia – viewed in conventional terms at least – seems bright.

尽管很难做出预测，尤其是对未来的预测（正如丹麦物理学家尼尔斯·玻尔等人所指出的），但大多数知识渊博的观察家认为，玉米在亚洲的作用在未来几十年将继续增长，因为潜在趋势对它的上升负有责任——人均收入增加和城市化尤其如此，但农场整合也越来越多——继续快速增长。可以肯定的是，气候变化、食品技术创新以及饮食方式甚至农业/食品制度可能发生的变化等因素可能会扰乱甚至逆转长期趋势，从而影响亚洲的玉米需求。但是，在可预见的未来，这种中断的可能性，更不用说逆转，似乎很渺茫，而亚洲玉米的未来——至少从传统角度来看——似乎是光明的。

Such prospects notwithstanding, there are still causes for concern regarding maize’s future in Asia, particularly when one considers the cereal grain’s trajectory – and increasingly controversial status – in the West, where it has many vociferous detractors today. Bluntly put, these critics point out that maize, despite its manifold virtues, is hardly benign in its overall effects. In so doing, they make a number of good points regarding the rising prominence of the cereal grain, and the production and consumption systems in which maize is often embedded, points well worth pondering.

尽管有这样的前景，但仍有理由对玉米在亚洲的未来感到担忧，尤其是当人们考虑到谷物在西方的发展轨迹——以及日益引起争议的地位时，如今在西方有许多强烈的批评者。直截了当地说，这些批评者指出，尽管玉米具有多种优点，但其总体效果很难说是良性的。在这样做的过程中，他们就谷物的日益突出以及玉米经常嵌入的生产和消费系统提出了许多值得思考的观点。

For example, critics bemoan the fact that maize production is generally heavily subsidised in developing countries, which limits opportunities for the cultivation of other, healthier alternatives. They are appalled by the cruel and unhealthy conditions of livestock housed in concentrated animal-feeding operations (CAFOs) in corn-based feed lots (operations increasingly common in China and other parts of Asia, by the way). They are very concerned about the deleterious long-term health consequences arising from the widespread human use of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which they claim promotes obesity, diabetes and what some [call](https://diabetesjournals.org/clinical/article/40/4/392/147743/Diabesity) the ‘diabesity complex’, which frequently presents in the West and, alas, has become more common in the East as well. They contend that using maize to produce ethanol is morally ‘obscene’ in a world wherein many people are still food insecure, if not outright deficient, which criticism resonates particularly broadly in 2022, in part because of Russia’s ‘special military operation’ in Ukraine. Critics often [condemn](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21284-2) the heavy place of GMOs in maize production, particularly in the US, and they often end by decrying the fact that the supposed negative externalities of maize production, particularly in large-scale agribusiness settings, are seldom factored into the price of maize, making it too cheap, which contention, of course, would bemuse, if not startle, many low-income maize consumers both in the developed world and in the least developed countries.

例如，批评者哀叹发展中国家的玉米生产普遍得到大量补贴，这限制了种植其他更健康替代品的机会。他们对以玉米为基础的饲料场集中动物饲养场 (CAFO) 饲养的牲畜的残酷和不健康状况感到震惊（顺便说一句，这种饲养场在中国和亚洲其他地区越来越普遍）。他们非常关注人类广泛使用高果糖玉米糖浆 (HFCS) 所带来的有害长期健康后果，他们声称这种物质会导致肥胖、糖尿病以及一些人称之为“糖尿病综合症”的疾病，这种疾病在西方国家经常出现而且，唉，在东方也变得越来越普遍。他们争辩说，在这个世界上使用玉米生产乙醇在道德上是“淫秽的”，在这个世界上，许多人仍然没有粮食保障，即使不是完全短缺，这种批评在 2022 年引起了特别广泛的共鸣，部分原因是俄罗斯在乌克兰的“特殊军事行动”。批评者经常谴责转基因生物在玉米生产中所占的重要地位，尤其是在美国，而且他们经常以谴责这样一个事实作为结尾：即玉米生产的所谓负外部性，特别是在大型农业综合企业环境中，很少被计入玉米价格，使其过于便宜，当然，这种争论即使不吃惊，也会让发达国家和最不发达国家的许多低收入玉米消费者感到困惑。

The maize story in Asia may end as tragedy, farce, or (hopefully) something else  
亚洲的玉米故事可能以悲剧、闹剧或（希望如此）其他方式结束  

How to weigh these purported vices against maize’s manifold virtues is a difficult question, subject in part to one’s ‘priors’ – as economists say – as well as to one’s perspective and ideology. Whatever the case, Asians and Asian nation-states going forward would do well to engage such criticism seriously so that they can possibly avoid or minimise some of the problems the West has experienced with maize. How? Another difficult question, particularly because in Asia maize production is concentrated not in rich countries with well-developed systems of economic and environmental regulation and large constituencies driven by ESG criteria, but in middle-income and low-income countries where [other](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12571-011-0140-5) concerns – growth and development, most notably – remain the top priorities, not surprisingly.

如何权衡这些所谓的缺点与玉米的多种优点是一个难题，部分取决于一个人的“先验”——正如经济学家所说——以及一个人的观点和意识形态。无论如何，未来的亚洲人和亚洲民族国家最好认真对待这种批评，这样他们就可以避免或尽量减少西方在玉米方面遇到的一些问题。如何？另一个棘手的问题，尤其是因为在亚洲，玉米生产并不集中在经济和环境监管体系发达以及受 ESG 标准驱动的大量选区的富裕国家，而是集中在中等收入和低收入国家，这些国家存在其他问题——增长和最值得注意的是，发展仍然是首要任务，这不足为奇。

Nonetheless, certain modest but helpful steps seem possible even today. For example, the development of more humane specifications for CAFOs could help Asia avoid the worst environmental, not to say ethical, practices associated with industrial agriculture in the West. Similarly, Asian peoples could be educated about the dangers of excessive dietary reliance on HFCS (and perhaps on palm oil, too) and Asian governments could promote the use of organic material other than maize in ethanol – biodiesel, for example – for the production of engine fuel, while encouraging the growth of the EV industry. Not earth-shattering perhaps, but not nothing either. And such steps would constitute a start.

尽管如此，即使在今天，某些适度但有益的步骤似乎也是可行的。例如，为 CAFO 制定更人性化的规范可以帮助亚洲避免与西方工业化农业相关的最恶劣的环境实践，更不用说道德实践了。同样，可以教育亚洲人民饮食过度依赖氢氟碳化物（也许还有棕榈油）的危险，亚洲政府可以促进使用玉米以外的有机材料制造乙醇——例如生物柴油——用于生产发动机燃料，同时鼓励电动汽车行业的发展。也许不是惊天动地，但也不是什么都没有。这些步骤将构成一个开始。

Are steps such as these sufficient to make a real difference? Hard to say. Here, though, one could do worse than to evoke Karl Marx, in particular his opening in _The_ _Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon_ (1852): ‘Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.’ Having followed the Western script pretty closely so far, the maize story in Asia may end as tragedy, farce, or (hopefully) something else. Let’s keep our fingers crossed.

诸如此类的步骤是否足以产生真正的影响？很难说。不过，在这里，除了唤起卡尔·马克思，尤其是他在《路易·拿破仑的雾月十八日》（1852 年）中的开场白之外，还可以做得更糟：“黑格尔在某处评论说，所有伟大的世界历史事实和人物都出现了两次，可以这么说。他忘了补充：第一次是悲剧，第二次是闹剧。到目前为止，亚洲的玉米故事非常接近西方剧本，可能会以悲剧、闹剧或（希望如此）其他方式结束。让我们祈祷吧。

However the maize narrative in Asia unfolds, a little story in Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney’s chapter on McDonald’s in Japan – from the classic [study](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=7364) _Golden Arches East: McDonald’s in Asia_ (1997) edited by the Harvard anthropologist James L Watson – is worth noting. The story involves a group of Japanese Boy Scouts in the US, who were thrilled to find, upon visiting Chicago, that the city had a McDonald’s too. McDonald’s was, of course, born in the US and headquartered in Chicago, but its transplantation to Asia has been so successful that, in many parts of Asia, the fast-food restaurant has become not merely familiar in cultural terms but, to many people, integral or even organic to society there. Will the same hold true some day for maize in Asia? Golden Maize Fields East, in other words. Indeed, if the trends of the past 40 years hold true, we may at some point find Asians surprised to learn that maize is grown in the Americas, too.

不管玉米在亚洲的故事如何展开，Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney 关于日本麦当劳的章节中的一个小故事——来自哈佛人类学家詹姆斯·沃森 (James L Watson) 编辑的经典研究金拱门东方：亚洲麦当劳 (1997)——值得一提。故事涉及一群在美国的日本童子军，他们在访问芝加哥后兴奋地发现这座城市也有一家麦当劳。麦当劳当然诞生于美国，总部设在芝加哥，但它对亚洲的移植非常成功，以至于在亚洲的许多地方，快餐店不仅在文化上变得耳熟能详，而且对许多人来说，对那里的社会来说是不可或缺的，甚至是有机的。有一天亚洲的玉米也会如此吗？换句话说，东部的金色玉米田。事实上，如果过去 40 年的趋势成立，我们可能会在某个时候发现亚洲人惊讶地发现美洲也种植玉米。
