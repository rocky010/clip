The story of 2022 was the emergence of AI, first with image generation models, including DALL-E, MidJourney, and the open source Stable Diffusion, and then ChatGPT, the first text-generation model [to break through in a major way](https://stratechery.com/2022/ai-homework/). It seems clear to me that this is a new epoch in technology.

2022年的故事是人工智能的出现，首先是图像生成模型，包括DALL-E、MidJourney和开源的Stable Diffusion，然后是ChatGPT，第一个文本生成模型取得重大突破。在我看来，这是技术的新纪元。

To determine how that epoch might develop, though, it is useful to look back 26 years to one of the most famous strategy books of all time: Clayton Christensen’s [The Innovator’s Dilemma](http://claytonchristensen.com/books/the-innovators-dilemma/), particularly this passage on the different kinds of innovations:

不过，要确定那个时代可能会如何发展，回顾 26 年前有史以来最著名的战略书籍之一是很有用的：克莱顿·克里斯滕森 (Clayton Christensen) 的《创新者的困境》(The Innovator's Dilemma)，尤其是这段关于不同类型创新的文章：

> Most new technologies foster improved product performance. I call these sustaining technologies. Some sustaining technologies can be discontinuous or radical in character, while others are of an incremental nature. What all sustaining technologies have in common is that they improve the performance of established products, along the dimensions of performance that mainstream customers in major markets have historically valued. Most technological advances in a given industry are sustaining in character…
> 
> 大多数新技术都促进了产品性能的提高。我称这些为持续性技术。一些持续性技术可能具有不连续性或激进性，而其他技术则具有渐进性。所有持续性技术的共同点是，它们根据主要市场的主流客户历来重视的性能维度，改进既定产品的性能。特定行业的大多数技术进步都具有持续性……
> 
> Disruptive technologies bring to a market a very different value proposition than had been available previously. Generally, disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few fringe (and generally new) customers value. Products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper, simpler, smaller, and, frequently, more convenient to use.
> 
> 颠覆性技术为市场带来了与以往截然不同的价值主张。一般来说，颠覆性技术在主流市场上的表现不如成熟产品。但它们还有一些边缘（通常是新）客户看重的其他功能。基于颠覆性技术的产品通常更便宜、更简单、更小，而且通常使用起来更方便。

It seems easy to look backwards and determine if an innovation was sustaining or disruptive by looking at how incumbent companies fared after that innovation came to market: if the innovation was sustaining, then incumbent companies became stronger; if it was disruptive then presumably startups captured most of the value.

通过观察现有公司在创新进入市场后的表现，似乎很容易回顾并确定创新是持续性的还是破坏性的：如果创新是持续性的，那么现有公司会变得更强大；如果它具有破坏性，那么大概是初创公司获得了大部分价值。

Consider previous tech epochs: 考虑以前的技术时代：

-   The PC was disruptive to nearly all of the existing incumbents; these relatively inexpensive and low-powered devices didn’t have nearly the capability or the profit margin of mini-computers, much less mainframes. That’s why IBM was happy to outsource both the original PC’s chip and OS to Intel and Microsoft, respectively, so that they could get a product out the door and satisfy their corporate customers; PCs got faster, though, and it was Intel and Microsoft that dominated as the market dwarfed everything that came before.
    
    PC 对几乎所有现有的现任者都具有破坏性；这些相对便宜和低功率的设备几乎没有小型计算机的能力或利润率，更不用说大型机了。这就是为什么 IBM 乐于将原始 PC 的芯片和操作系统分别外包给英特尔和微软，这样他们就可以推出产品并满足他们的企业客户；个人电脑变得更快了，不过，英特尔和微软占据了主导地位，因为市场上的一切都相形见绌。
    
-   The Internet was almost entirely new market innovation, and thus defined by completely new companies that, to the extent they disrupted incumbents, did so in industries far removed from technology, particularly those involving information (i.e. the media). This was the era of Google, Facebook, online marketplaces and e-commerce, etc. All of these applications ran on PCs powered by Windows and Intel.
    
    互联网几乎是全新的市场创新，因此由全新的公司定义，这些公司在颠覆现有企业的范围内，在远离技术的行业中这样做，尤其是那些涉及信息的行业（即媒体）。这是谷歌、Facebook、在线市场和电子商务等的时代。所有这些应用程序都运行在由 Windows 和英特尔驱动的 PC 上。
    
-   Cloud computing is arguably part of the Internet, but I think it deserves its own category. It was also extremely disruptive: commodity x86 architecture swept out dedicated server hardware, and an entire host of SaaS startups peeled off features from incumbents to build companies. What is notable is that the core infrastructure for cloud computing was primarily built by the winners of previous epochs: Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Microsoft is particularly notable because the company also transitioned its traditional software business to a SaaS service, in part because the company had already transitioned said software business to a subscription model.
    
    云计算可以说是互联网的一部分，但我认为它应该有自己的一类。它也极具破坏性：商品 x86 架构淘汰了专用服务器硬件，大量 SaaS 初创公司剥离了现有企业的功能以建立公司。值得注意的是，云计算的核心基础设施主要是由前几个时代的赢家建造的：亚马逊、微软和谷歌。微软尤其引人注目，因为该公司还将其传统软件业务转变为 SaaS 服务，部分原因是该公司已经将上述软件业务转变为订阅模式。
    
-   Mobile ended up being dominated by two incumbents: Apple and Google. That doesn’t mean it wasn’t disruptive, though: Apple’s new UI paradigm entailed not viewing the phone as a small PC, a la Microsoft; Google’s new business model paradigm entailed not viewing phones as a direct profit center for operating system sales, but rather as [a moat for their advertising business](https://abovethecrowd.com/2011/03/24/freight-train-that-is-android/).
    
    移动最终由两家老牌公司主导：苹果和谷歌。不过，这并不意味着它没有颠覆性：Apple 的新 UI 范式要求不要将手机视为小型 PC，就像微软那样；谷歌的新商业模式范式不要求将手机视为操作系统销售的直接利润中心，而是将其视为其广告业务的护城河。
    

What is notable about this history is that the supposition I stated above isn’t quite right; disruptive innovations do consistently come from new entrants in a market, but those new entrants aren’t necessarily startups: some of the biggest winners in previous tech epochs have been existing companies leveraging their current business to move into a new space. At the same time, the other tenets of Christensen’s theory hold: Microsoft struggled with mobile because it was disruptive, but SaaS was ultimately sustaining because its business model was already aligned.

这段历史值得注意的是，我上面所说的假设并不完全正确；颠覆性创新确实始终来自市场的新进入者，但这些新进入者不一定是初创公司：在以前的技术时代，一些最大的赢家是现有公司利用其当前业务进入新领域。与此同时，克里斯滕森理论的其他原则也成立：微软在移动领域苦苦挣扎，因为它具有颠覆性，但 SaaS 最终得以维持，因为它的商业模式已经一致。

___

Given the success of existing companies with new epochs, the most obvious place to start when thinking about the impact of AI is with the big five: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.

鉴于现有公司在新时代取得的成功，在考虑人工智能的影响时，最明显的起点是五巨头：苹果、亚马逊、Facebook、谷歌和微软。

### Apple

I already referenced one of the most famous books about tech strategy; one of the most famous essays was Joel Spolsky’s [Strategy Letter V](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/06/12/strategy-letter-v/), particularly this famous line:

我已经参考了一本关于技术战略的最著名的书；最著名的文章之一是 Joel Spolsky 的 Strategy Letter V ，尤其是这句著名的话：

> Smart companies try to commoditize their products’ complements.  
> 聪明的公司会尝试将其产品的互补品商品化。  

Spolsky wrote this line in the context of explaining why large companies would invest in open source software:  
Spolsky 在解释为什么大公司会投资开源软件时写下了这句话：  

> Debugged code is NOT free, whether proprietary or open source. Even if you don’t pay cash dollars for it, it has opportunity cost, and it has time cost. There is a finite amount of volunteer programming talent available for open source work, and each open source project competes with each other open source project for the same limited programming resource, and only the sexiest projects really have more volunteer developers than they can use. To summarize, I’m not very impressed by people who try to prove wild economic things about free-as-in-beer software, because they’re just getting divide-by-zero errors as far as I’m concerned.
> 
> 调试代码不是免费的，无论是专有的还是开源的。即使您不为此支付现金，它也有机会成本和时间成本。可用于开源工作的志愿编程人才数量有限，每个开源项目都与其他开源项目竞争同样有限的编程资源，只有最性感的项目才真正拥有超过他们可以使用的志愿开发人员。总而言之，我对那些试图证明免费啤酒软件的疯狂经济事物的人印象不深，因为就我而言，他们只是得到被零除的错误。
> 
> Open source is not exempt from the laws of gravity or economics. We saw this with Eazel, ArsDigita, The Company Formerly Known as VA Linux and a lot of other attempts. But something is still going on which very few people in the open source world really understand: a lot of very large public companies, with responsibilities to maximize shareholder value, are investing a lot of money in supporting open source software, usually by paying large teams of programmers to work on it. And that’s what the principle of complements explains.
> 
> 开源不能免于重力法则或经济学。我们在 Eazel、ArsDigita、The Company Formerly Known as VA Linux 和许多其他尝试中看到了这一点。但是开源世界中很少有人真正理解的事情仍在发生：许多非常大的上市公司，肩负着最大化股东价值的责任，正在投入大量资金来支持开源软件，通常是通过支付大型团队的程序员来处理它。这就是补语原理所解释的。
> 
> Once again: demand for a product increases when the price of its complements decreases. In general, a company’s strategic interest is going to be to get the price of their complements as low as possible. The lowest theoretically sustainable price would be the “commodity price” — the price that arises when you have a bunch of competitors offering indistinguishable goods. So, smart companies try to commoditize their products’ complements. If you can do this, demand for your product will increase and you will be able to charge more and make more.
> 
> 再一次：当产品的互补品价格下降时，对产品的需求增加。一般来说，一家公司的战略利益是尽可能降低其互补产品的价格。理论上可持续的最低价格将是“商品价格”——当你有一群竞争对手提供无法区分的商品时出现的价格。因此，聪明的公司会尝试将其产品的互补品商品化。如果你能做到这一点，对你产品的需求就会增加，你就能收取更多的费用，赚更多的钱。

Apple invests in open source technologies, most notably the the Darwin kernel for its operating systems and the WebKit browser engine; the latter fits Spolsky’s prescription as ensuring that the web works well with Apple devices makes Apple’s devices more valuable.

Apple 投资开源技术，最著名的是用于其操作系统的 Darwin 内核和 WebKit 浏览器引擎；后者符合 Spolsky 的处方，因为确保网络与 Apple 设备良好配合可以使 Apple 的设备更有价值。

Apple’s efforts in AI, meanwhile, have been largely proprietary: traditional machine learning models are used for things like recommendations and photo identification and voice recognition, but nothing that moves the needle for Apple’s business in a major way. Apple did, though, receive an incredible gift from the open source world: Stable Diffusion.

与此同时，Apple 在 AI 方面的努力在很大程度上是专有的：传统的机器学习模型用于推荐、照片识别和语音识别等方面，但并没有对 Apple 的业务产生重大影响。不过，Apple 确实从开源世界收到了一份不可思议的礼物：Stable Diffusion。

Stable Diffusion is remarkable not simply because it is open source, but also because the model is surprisingly small: when it was released it could already run on some consumer graphics cards; within a matter of weeks it had been optimized to the point where [it could run on an iPhone](https://stratechery.com/2022/lensa-and-stable-diffusion-stable-diffusion-and-apple-silicon-open-questions/).

Stable Diffusion 之所以引人注目，不仅因为它是开源的，还因为它的模型出奇的小：当它发布时，它已经可以在一些消费类显卡上运行；几周之内，它就被优化到可以在 iPhone 上运行的程度。

Apple, to its immense credit, has seized this opportunity, with [this announcement](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/stable-diffusion-coreml-apple-silicon) from its machine learning group last month:

值得称赞的是，Apple 抓住了这个机会，其机器学习团队上个月发布了以下公告：

> Today, we are excited to release optimizations to Core ML for Stable Diffusion in macOS 13.1 and iOS 16.2, along with code to get started with deploying to Apple Silicon devices…
> 
> 今天，我们很高兴发布针对 macOS 13.1 和 iOS 16.2 中稳定扩散的 Core ML 优化，以及开始部署到 Apple Silicon 设备的代码……
> 
> One of the key questions for Stable Diffusion in any app is where the model is running. There are a number of reasons why on-device deployment of Stable Diffusion in an app is preferable to a server-based approach. First, the privacy of the end user is protected because any data the user provided as input to the model stays on the user’s device. Second, after initial download, users don’t require an internet connection to use the model. Finally, locally deploying this model enables developers to reduce or eliminate their server-related costs…
> 
> 在任何应用程序中稳定扩散的关键问题之一是模型运行的位置。在应用程序中在设备上部署 Stable Diffusion 比基于服务器的方法更可取的原因有很多。首先，最终用户的隐私受到保护，因为用户提供作为模型输入的任何数据都保留在用户的设备上。其次，初始下载后，用户无需互联网连接即可使用该模型。最后，在本地部署此模型使开发人员能够减少或消除与服务器相关的成本……
> 
> Optimizing Core ML for Stable Diffusion and simplifying model conversion makes it easier for developers to incorporate this technology in their apps in a privacy-preserving and economically feasible way, while getting the best performance on Apple Silicon. This release comprises a Python package for converting Stable Diffusion models from PyTorch to Core ML using diffusers and coremltools, as well as a Swift package to deploy the models.
> 
> 针对稳定扩散优化 Core ML 并简化模型转换，让开发者能够更轻松地以保护隐私且经济可行的方式将这项技术整合到他们的应用程序中，同时在 Apple Silicon 上获得最佳性能。此版本包含一个用于使用扩散器和 coremltools 将稳定扩散模型从 PyTorch 转换为 Core ML 的 Python 包，以及一个用于部署模型的 Swift 包。

It’s important to note that this announcement came in two parts: first, Apple optimized the Stable Diffusion model itself (which it could do because it was open source); second, Apple updated its operating system, which thanks to Apple’s integrated model, is already tuned to Apple’s own chips.

值得注意的是，这个公告分为两部分：首先，Apple 优化了 Stable Diffusion 模型本身（它可以做到这一点，因为它是开源的）；其次，苹果更新了操作系统，得益于苹果的集成模式，已经针对苹果自己的芯片进行了调整。

Moreover, it seems safe to assume that this is only the beginning: while Apple has been shipping its so-called “Neural Engine” on its own chips for years now, that AI-specific hardware is tuned to Apple’s own needs; it seems likely that future Apple chips, if not this year than probably next year, will be tuned for Stable Diffusion as well. Stable Diffusion itself, meanwhile, could be built into Apple’s operating systems, with easily accessible APIs for any app developer.

此外，可以肯定地说这只是一个开始：虽然苹果多年来一直在自己的芯片上推出所谓的“神经引擎”，但人工智能专用硬件已根据苹果自身的需求进行了调整；看来未来的 Apple 芯片，即使不是今年，也可能是明年，也将针对 Stable Diffusion 进行调整。与此同时，Stable Diffusion 本身可以内置到 Apple 的操作系统中，并为任何应用程序开发人员提供易于访问的 API。

This raises the prospect of “good enough” image generation capabilities being effectively built-in to Apple’s devices, and thus accessible to any developer without the need to scale up a back-end infrastructure of the sort needed by the viral hit Lensa. And, by extension, the winners in this world end up looking a lot like the winners in the App Store era: Apple wins because its integration and chip advantage are put to use to deliver differentiated apps, while small independent app makers have the APIs and distribution channel to build new businesses.

这提出了将“足够好”的图像生成功能有效地内置到 Apple 设备中的前景，因此任何开发人员都可以使用它，而无需扩展病毒式传播的 Lensa 所需的那种后端基础设施。而且，推而广之，这个世界的赢家最终看起来很像 App Store 时代的赢家：Apple 获胜是因为其集成和芯片优势被用于提供差异化的应用程序，而小型独立应用程序制造商拥有 API 和建立新业务的分销渠道。

The losers, on the other hand, would be centralized image generation services like Dall-E or MidJourney, and the cloud providers that undergird them (and, to date, undergird the aforementioned Stable Diffusion apps like Lensa). Stable Diffusion on Apple devices won’t take over the entire market, to be sure — Dall-E and MidJourney are both “better” than Stable Diffusion, at least in my estimation, and there is of course a big world outside of Apple devices, but built-in local capabilities will affect the ultimate addressable market for both centralized services and centralized compute.

另一方面，输家将是集中式图像生成服务，如 Dall-E 或 MidJourney，以及支持它们的云提供商（迄今为止，支持上述 Stable Diffusion 应用程序，如 Lensa）。可以肯定的是，Apple 设备上的 Stable Diffusion 不会占领整个市场——Dall-E 和 MidJourney 都比 Stable Diffusion“更好”，至少在我看来是这样，当然苹果设备之外还有广阔的世界，但内置的本地功能将影响集中式服务和集中式计算的最终目标市场。

### Amazon

Amazon, like Apple, uses machine learning across its applications; the direct consumer use cases for things like image and text generation, though, seem less obvious. What is already important is AWS, which sells access to GPUs in the cloud.

亚马逊和苹果一样，在其应用程序中使用机器学习；不过，图像和文本生成等直接消费者用例似乎不太明显。已经很重要的是 AWS，它出售对云端 GPU 的访问权。

Some of this is used for training, including Stable Diffusion, which [according to the founder and CEO of Stability AI Emad Mostaque](https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1563870674111832066) used 256 Nvidia A100s for 150,000 hours for a market-rate cost of $600,000 (which is surprisingly low!). The larger use case, though, is inference, i.e. the actual application of the model to produce images (or text, in the case of ChatGPT). Every time you generate an image in MidJourney, or an avatar in Lensa, inference is being run on a GPU in the cloud.

其中一些用于训练，包括 Stable Diffusion，据 Stability AI 的创始人兼首席执行官 Emad Mostaque 称，它使用 256 台 Nvidia A100 运行 150,000 小时，市场价格为 600,000 美元（低得惊人！）。不过，更大的用例是推理，即实际应用模型生成图像（或文本，在 ChatGPT 的情况下）。每次您在 MidJourney 中生成图像或在 Lensa 中生成头像时，推理都会在云中的 GPU 上运行。

Amazon’s prospects in this space will depend on a number of factors. First, and most obvious, is just how useful these products end up being in the real world. Beyond that, though, Apple’s progress in building local generation techniques could have a significant impact. Amazon, though, is a chip maker in its own right: while most of its efforts to date have been focused on its Graviton CPUs, the company could build dedicated hardware of its own for models like Stable Diffusion and compete on price. Still, AWS is hedging its bets: the cloud service is a major partner when it comes to Nvidia’s offerings as well.

亚马逊在这一领域的前景将取决于多种因素。首先，也是最明显的是，这些产品最终在现实世界中的用处有多大。不过，除此之外，Apple 在构建本地生成技术方面取得的进展可能会产生重大影响。不过，亚马逊本身就是一家芯片制造商：虽然迄今为止它的大部分努力都集中在其 Graviton CPU 上，但该公司可以为 Stable Diffusion 等模型构建自己的专用硬件，并在价格上展开竞争。尽管如此，AWS 仍在两面下注：云服务也是 Nvidia 产品的主要合作伙伴。

The big short-term question for Amazon will be in gauging demand: not having enough GPUs will be leaving money on the table; buying too many that sit idle, though, would be a major cost for a company trying to limit them. At the same time, it wouldn’t be the worst error to make: one of the challenges with AI is the fact that inference costs money; in other words, making something with AI has marginal costs.

亚马逊的短期大问题将在于衡量需求：没有足够的 GPU 将导致资金流失；但是，购买太多闲置的产品对于试图限制它们的公司来说将是一项重大成本。同时，这还不是最糟糕的错误：人工智能面临的挑战之一是推理需要花钱；换句话说，用 AI 做东西是有边际成本的。

This issue of marginal costs is, I suspect, an under-appreciated challenge in terms of developing compelling AI products. While cloud services have always had costs, the discrete nature of AI generation may make it challenging to fund the sort of iteration necessary to achieve product-market fit; I don’t think it’s an accident that ChatGPT, the biggest breakout product to-date, was both free to end users and provided by a company in OpenAI that both built its own model and has a sweetheart deal from Microsoft for compute capacity. If AWS had to sell GPUs for cheap that could spur more use in the long run.

我怀疑，就开发引人注目的人工智能产品而言，边际成本问题是一个未被充分认识的挑战。虽然云服务总是有成本的，但人工智能生成的离散性可能使得为实现产品市场匹配所需的迭代提供资金具有挑战性；我认为 ChatGPT 是迄今为止最大的突破性产品，它不仅对最终用户免费，而且由 OpenAI 中的一家公司提供，这两家公司都建立了自己的模型，并与微软就计算能力达成了一项甜心交易，我认为这并非偶然。如果 AWS 必须以低价出售 GPU，从长远来看可能会刺激更多的使用。

That noted, these costs should come down over time: models will become more efficient even as chips become faster and more efficient in their own right, and there should be returns to scale for cloud services once there are sufficient products in the market maximizing utilization of their investments. Still, it is an open question as to how much full stack integration will make a difference, in addition to the aforementioned possibility of running inference locally.

值得注意的是，这些成本应该会随着时间的推移而下降：即使芯片本身变得更快、更高效，模型也会变得更有效率，一旦市场上有足够的产品最大限度地利用云服务，云服务就应该有规模回报他们的投资。尽管如此，除了上述在本地运行推理的可能性之外，全栈集成将产生多大影响仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。

### Meta

I already detailed in [Meta Myths](https://stratechery.com/2022/meta-myths/) why I think that AI is a massive opportunity for Meta and worth the huge capital expenditures the company is making:

我已经在 Meta Myths 中详细说明了为什么我认为 AI 对 Meta 来说是一个巨大的机会，值得公司投入巨额资本支出：

> Meta has huge data centers, but those data centers are primarily about CPU compute, which is what is needed to power Meta’s services. CPU compute is also what was necessary to drive Meta’s deterministic ad model, and the algorithms it used to recommend content from your network.
> 
> Meta 拥有庞大的数据中心，但这些数据中心主要用于 CPU 计算，这是为 Meta 的服务提供动力所需要的。 CPU 计算也是驱动 Meta 的确定性广告模型及其用于从您的网络推荐内容的算法所必需的。
> 
> The long-term solution to ATT, though, is to build probabilistic models that not only figure out who should be targeted (which, to be fair, Meta was already using machine learning for), but also understanding which ads converted and which didn’t. These probabilistic models will be built by massive fleets of GPUs, which, in the case of Nvidia’s A100 cards, cost in the five figures; that may have been too pricey in a world where deterministic ads worked better anyways, but Meta isn’t in that world any longer, and it would be foolish to not invest in better targeting and measurement.
> 
> 不过，ATT 的长期解决方案是建立概率模型，不仅可以确定应该针对谁（公平地说，Meta 已经在使用机器学习），还可以了解哪些广告转化了，哪些没有转化。吨。这些概率模型将由大量 GPU 构建，就 Nvidia 的 A100 卡而言，成本高达五位数；在一个确定性广告效果更好的世界里，这可能太贵了，但 Meta 已经不在那个世界了，不投资于更好的定位和衡量是愚蠢的。
> 
> Moreover, the same approach will be essential to Reels’ continued growth: it is massively more difficult to recommend content from across the entire network than only from your friends and family, particularly because Meta plans to recommend not just video but also media of all types, and intersperse it with content you care about. Here too AI models will be the key, and the equipment to build those models costs a lot of money.
> 
> 此外，同样的方法对于 Reels 的持续增长至关重要：从整个网络推荐内容比仅从您的朋友和家人推荐内容要困难得多，特别是因为 Meta 计划不仅推荐视频，还推荐所有类型的媒体，并在其中穿插您关心的内容。在这里，人工智能模型也将是关键，而构建这些模型的设备需要花费大量资金。
> 
> In the long run, though, this investment should pay off. First, there are the benefits to better targeting and better recommendations I just described, which should restart revenue growth. Second, once these AI data centers are built out the cost to maintain and upgrade them should be significantly less than the initial cost of building them the first time. Third, this massive investment is one no other company can make, except for Google (and, not coincidentally, Google’s capital expenditures are set to rise as well).
> 
> 不过，从长远来看，这项投资应该会有所回报。首先，我刚才描述的更好的定位和更好的推荐有好处，这应该会重新启动收入增长。其次，一旦这些人工智能数据中心建成，维护和升级它们的成本应该大大低于首次建设它们的初始成本。第三，这项巨额投资是除 Google 之外其他公司无法进行的投资（而且，并非巧合的是，Google 的资本支出也将增加）。
> 
> That last point is perhaps the most important: ATT hurt Meta more than any other company, because it already had by far the largest and most finely-tuned ad business, but in the long run it should deepen Meta’s moat. This level of investment simply isn’t viable for a company like Snap or Twitter or any of the other also-rans in digital advertising (even beyond the fact that Snap relies on cloud providers instead of its own data centers); when you combine the fact that Meta’s ad targeting will likely start to pull away from the field (outside of Google), with the massive increase in inventory that comes from Reels (which reduces prices), it will be a wonder why any advertiser would bother going anywhere else.
> 
> 最后一点可能是最重要的：ATT 对 Meta 的伤害比任何其他公司都大，因为它已经拥有迄今为止最大、最精细调整的广告业务，但从长远来看，它应该会加深 Meta 的护城河。这种投资水平对于像 Snap 或 Twitter 这样的公司或任何其他在数字广告领域处于劣势的公司来说根本不可行（甚至超出了 Snap 依赖云提供商而不是自己的数据中心的事实）；当您将 Meta 的广告定位可能会开始远离该领域（Google 之外）这一事实与来自 Reels 的库存大量增加（这会降低价格）这一事实结合起来时，这将是一个奇迹，为什么任何广告商都会打扰去别的地方。

An important factor in making Meta’s AI work is not simply building the base model but also tuning it to individual users on an ongoing basis; that is what will take such a large amount of capacity and it will be essential for Meta to figure out how to do this customization cost-effectively. Here, though, it helps that Meta’s offering will probably be increasingly integrated: while the company may have [committed to Qualcomm for chips for its VR headsets](https://stratechery.com/2022/metas-chip-decision-horizon-worlds-platform-fees-metas-missing-metaverse-strategy/), Meta continues to develop its own server chips; the company has also [released tools](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-launches-ai-software-tools-help-speed-up-work-blog-2022-10-03/) to abstract away Nvidia and AMD chips for its workloads, but it seems likely the company is working on its own AI chips as well.

使 Meta 的 AI 发挥作用的一个重要因素不仅仅是构建基础模型，还在于持续针对个人用户对其进行调整；这就是需要如此大量容量的原因，Meta 必须弄清楚如何经济高效地进行这种定制。不过，在这方面，Meta 的产品可能会越来越集成，这有助于：虽然该公司可能已向高通公司承诺为其 VR 耳机提供芯片，但 Meta 仍在继续开发自己的服务器芯片；该公司还发布了为其工作负载抽象出 Nvidia 和 AMD 芯片的工具，但该公司似乎也在开发自己的 AI 芯片。

What will be interesting to see is how things like image and text generation impact Meta in the long run: [Sam Lessin has posited](https://twitter.com/lessin/status/1551931628305502208) that [the end-game for algorithmic timelines](https://stratechery.com/2022/instagram-tiktok-and-the-three-trends/) is AI content; I’ve made the same argument [when it comes to the Metaverse](https://stratechery.com/2022/dall-e-the-metaverse-and-zero-marginal-content/). In other words, while Meta is investing in AI to give personalized recommendations, that idea, combined with 2022’s breakthroughs, is personalized content, delivered through Meta’s channels.

有趣的是，从长远来看，图像和文本生成等事物如何影响 Meta：Sam Lessin 假设算法时间线的最终游戏是 AI 内容；我在谈到 Metaverse 时也提出了同样的论点。换句话说，虽然 Meta 正在投资人工智能以提供个性化推荐，但这个想法与 2022 年的突破相结合，是通过 Meta 渠道提供的个性化内容。

For now it will be interesting to see how Meta’s advertising tools develop: the entire process of both generating and A/B testing copy and images can be done by AI, and no company is better than Meta at making these sort of capabilities available at scale. Keep in mind that Meta’s advertising is primarily about the top of the funnel: the goal is to catch consumers’ eyes for a product or service or app they did not know previously existed; this means that there will be a lot of misses — the vast majority of ads do not convert — but that also means there is a lot of latitude for experimentation and iteration. This seems very well suited to AI: yes, generation may have marginal costs, but those marginal costs are drastically lower than a human.

现在，看看 Meta 的广告工具如何发展将会很有趣：生成和 A/B 测试副本和图像的整个过程都可以由 AI 完成，而且在大规模提供这些功能方面，没有公司比 Meta 更好.请记住，Meta 的广告主要是关于漏斗的顶部：目标是吸引消费者对他们以前不知道的产品或服务或应用程序的注意；这意味着会有很多失误——绝大多数广告没有转化——但这也意味着有很大的实验和迭代空间。这似乎非常适合人工智能：是的，发电可能有边际成本，但这些边际成本远低于人类。

### Google

The Innovator’s Dilemma was published in 1997; [that was the year](https://www.ft.com/content/f49cb408-ecd8-11e0-be97-00144feab49a) that Eastman Kodak’s stock reached its highest price of $94.25, and for seemingly good reason: Kodak, in terms of technology, was perfectly placed. Not only did the company dominate the current technology of film, it had also invented the next wave: the digital camera.

《创新者的窘境》于 1997 年出版；就在这一年，伊士曼柯达的股票达到了最高价 94.25 美元，而且理由似乎很充分：就技术而言，柯达处于完美的位置。该公司不仅主导了当前的胶片技术，还发明了下一波浪潮：数码相机。

The problem came down to business model: Kodak made a lot of money with very good margins providing silver halide film; digital cameras, on the other hand, were digital, which means they didn’t need film at all. Kodak’s management was thus very incentivized to convince themselves that digital cameras would only ever be for amateurs, and only when they became drastically cheaper, which would certainly take a very long time.

问题归结为商业模式：柯达通过提供卤化银胶片赚了很多钱，利润率很高；另一方面，数码相机是数码相机，这意味着它们根本不需要胶卷。因此，柯达的管理层非常有动力说服自己，数码相机只会供业余爱好者使用，而且只有当它们变得非常便宜时，这肯定会花费很长时间。

In fact, Kodak’s management was right: it took over 25 years from the time of the digital camera’s invention for digital camera sales to surpass film camera sales; it took longer still for digital cameras to be used in professional applications. Kodak made a lot of money in the meantime, and paid out billions of dollars in dividends. And, while the company went bankrupt in 2012, that was because consumers had access to better products: first digital cameras, and eventually, phones with cameras built in.

事实上，柯达的管理层是对的：从数码相机发明到数码相机销量超过胶片相机销量，用了25年多的时间；数码相机用于专业应用还需要更长的时间。柯达在此期间赚了很多钱，并派发了数十亿美元的股息。而且，虽然该公司在 2012 年破产，但那是因为消费者可以获得更好的产品：首先是数码相机，最终是内置摄像头的手机。

The idea that this is a happy ending is, to be sure, a contrarian view: most view Kodak as a failure, because we expect companies to live forever. In this view Kodak is a cautionary tale of how an innovative company can allow its business model to lead it to its eventual doom, even if said doom was the result of consumers getting something better.

可以肯定的是，认为这是一个圆满结局的想法是一种逆向观点：大多数人认为柯达是失败的，因为我们希望公司永远存在。从这个角度来看，柯达是一个警示故事，说明一家创新公司如何允许其商业模式将其引向最终的厄运，即使所说的厄运是消费者得到更好的东西的结果。

And thus we arrive at Google and AI. Google invented the transformer, the key technology undergirding the latest AI models. Google is rumored to have a conversation chat product that is far superior to ChatGPT. Google claims that its image generation capabilities are better than Dall-E or anyone else on the market. And yet, these claims are just that: claims, because there aren’t any actual products on the market.

因此我们来到了谷歌和人工智能。谷歌发明了变压器，这是支撑最新人工智能模型的关键技术。据传谷歌有一款对话聊天产品，其性能远远优于 ChatGPT。谷歌声称其图像生成能力优于 Dall-E 或市场上的任何其他公司。然而，这些声明只是：声明，因为市场上没有任何实际产品。

This isn’t a surprise: Google has long been a leader in using machine learning to make its search and other consumer-facing products better (and has offered that technology as a service through Google Cloud). Search, though, has always depended on humans as the ultimate arbiter: Google will provide links, but it is the user that decides which one is the correct one by clicking on it. This extended to ads: Google’s offering was revolutionary because instead of charging advertisers for impressions — the value of which was very difficult to ascertain, particularly 20 years ago — it charged for clicks; the very people the advertisers were trying to reach would decide if their ad was good enough.

这并不奇怪：谷歌长期以来一直是使用机器学习来改进其搜索和其他面向消费者的产品的领导者（并通过谷歌云提供该技术作为服务）。然而，搜索一直依赖于人类作为最终的仲裁者：谷歌将提供链接，但用户通过点击来决定哪个是正确的。这扩展到广告：谷歌的产品是革命性的，因为它不是按展示次数向广告商收费——其价值很难确定，尤其是在 20 年前——而是按点击次数收费；广告商试图接触的人将决定他们的广告是否足够好。

I wrote about the conundrum this presented for Google’s business in a world of AI seven years ago in [Google and the Limits of Strategy](https://stratechery.com/2016/google-and-the-limits-of-strategy/):

七年前，我在谷歌和战略的局限性中写到了谷歌在人工智能世界中的业务所面临的难题：

> In yesterday’s keynote, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, after a recounting of tech history that emphasized the PC-Web-Mobile epochs I described [in late 2014](https://stratechery.com/2014/state-consumer-technology-end-2014/), declared that we are moving from a mobile-first world to an AI-first one; that was the context for the introduction of the Google Assistant.
> 
> 在昨天的主题演讲中，谷歌首席执行官桑达尔皮查伊在重述技术历史并强调我在 2014 年底描述的 PC-Web-Mobile 时代后宣布，我们正在从移动优先的世界转向人工智能优先的世界；这就是引入 Google Assistant 的背景。
> 
> It was a year prior to the aforementioned iOS 6 that Apple first introduced the idea of an assistant in the guise of Siri; for the first time you could (theoretically) compute by voice. It didn’t work very well at first (arguably it still doesn’t), but the implications for computing generally and Google specifically were profound: voice interaction both expanded _where_ computing could be done, from situations in which you could devote your eyes and hands to your device to effectively everywhere, even as it constrained _what_ you could do. An assistant has to be far more proactive than, for example, a search results page; it’s not enough to present possible answers: rather, an assistant needs to give the _right_ answer.
> 
> 在上述 iOS 6 之前的一年，Apple 首次以 Siri 的名义引入了助手的想法。你第一次可以（理论上）通过语音进行计算。起初它并没有很好地工作（可以说它仍然没有），但对一般计算和谷歌的影响是深远的：语音交互都扩展了可以进行计算的地方，从你可以投入你的眼睛和双手的情况您的设备可以随处有效使用，即使它限制了您可以做的事情。助手必须比搜索结果页面更主动；仅仅提供可能的答案是不够的：相反，助手需要给出正确的答案。
> 
> This is a welcome shift for Google the technology; from the beginning the search engine has included an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button, so confident was Google founder Larry Page that the search engine could deliver you the exact result you wanted, and while yesterday’s Google Assistant demos were canned, the results, particularly when it came to contextual awareness, were far more impressive than the other assistants on the market. More broadly, few dispute that Google is a clear leader when it comes to the artificial intelligence and machine learning that underlie their assistant.
> 
> 这对谷歌技术来说是一个可喜的转变；从一开始，搜索引擎就包含了一个“我手气不错”的按钮，谷歌创始人拉里佩奇非常有信心搜索引擎可以为你提供你想要的准确结果，虽然昨天的谷歌智能助理演示是固定的，但结果，特别是在上下文感知方面，比市场上的其他助手更令人印象深刻。更广泛地说，很少有人质疑谷歌在作为其助手基础的人工智能和机器学习方面是明显的领导者。
> 
> A business, though, is about more than technology, and Google has two significant shortcomings when it comes to assistants in particular. First, as I explained after this year’s Google I/O, the company has a [go-to-market gap](https://stratechery.com/2016/googles-go-to-market-gap/): assistants are only useful if they are available, which in the case of hundreds of millions of iOS users means downloading and using a separate app (or building the sort of experience that, like Facebook, users will willingly spend extensive amounts of time in).
> 
> 然而，一项业务不仅仅关乎技术，谷歌在助手方面尤其存在两个重大缺陷。首先，正如我在今年的 Google I/O 之后所解释的那样，该公司在进入市场方面存在差距：助手只有在可用时才有用，对于数亿 iOS 用户而言，这意味着需要下载和使用单独的应用程序（或构建用户愿意在其中花费大量时间的体验，例如 Facebook）。
> 
> Secondly, though, Google has a business-model problem: the “I’m Feeling Lucky Button” guaranteed that the search in question would not make Google any money. After all, if a user doesn’t have to choose from search results, said user also doesn’t have the opportunity to click an ad, thus choosing the winner of the competition Google created between its advertisers for user attention. Google Assistant has the exact same problem: where do the ads go?
> 
> 其次，尽管如此，谷歌有一个商业模式问题：“手气不错的按钮”保证相关搜索不会让谷歌赚到钱。毕竟，如果用户不必从搜索结果中进行选择，则表示用户也没有机会点击广告，从而选择谷歌在其广告商之间为吸引用户注意力而创造的竞争的赢家。 Google Assistant 也有同样的问题：广告去哪儿了？

That Article assumed that Google Assistant was going to be used to differentiate Google phones as an exclusive offering; that ended up being wrong, but the underlying analysis remains valid. Over the past seven years Google’s primary business model innovation has been to cram ever more ads into Search, a particularly effective tactic on mobile. And, to be fair, the sort of searches where Google makes the most money — travel, insurance, etc. — may not be well-suited for chat interfaces anyways.

那篇文章假设 Google Assistant 将被用来区分谷歌手机作为独家产品；这最终是错误的，但潜在的分析仍然有效。在过去的七年里，谷歌的主要商业模式创新一直是将更多的广告塞进搜索中，这是一种在移动设备上特别有效的策略。而且，公平地说，谷歌最赚钱的搜索类型——旅游、保险等——可能无论如何都不太适合聊天界面。

That, though, ought only increase the concern for Google’s management that generative AI may, in the specific context of search, represent a disruptive innovation instead of a sustaining one. Disruptive innovation is, at least in the beginning, not as good as what already exists; that’s why it is easily dismissed by managers who can avoid thinking about the business model challenges by (correctly!) telling themselves that their current product is better. The problem, of course, is that the disruptive product gets better, even as the incumbent’s product becomes ever more bloated and hard to use — and that certainly sounds a lot like Google Search’s current trajectory.

不过，这只会增加谷歌管理层的担忧，即在特定的搜索环境中，生成人工智能可能代表一种颠覆性创新，而不是持续性创新。至少在开始时，颠覆性创新不如现有的创新；这就是为什么它很容易被管理者忽略的原因，他们可以通过（正确地！）告诉自己他们当前的产品更好来避免思考商业模式的挑战。当然，问题是颠覆性产品变得更好，即使现任产品变得越来越臃肿和难以使用——这听起来很像谷歌搜索当前的发展轨迹。

I’m not calling the top for Google; [I did that previously](https://stratechery.com/2014/peak-google/) and was [hilariously wrong](https://stratechery.com/2019/the-google-squeeze/). Being wrong, though, is more often than not a matter of timing: yes, Google has its cloud and YouTube’s dominance only seems to be increasing, but the outline of Search’s peak seems clear even if it throws of cash and profits for years.

我不是在为谷歌打电话。我以前这样做过，但错得可笑。不过，犯错往往是时间问题：是的，谷歌拥有自己的云服务，而 YouTube 的主导地位似乎只是在增加，但即使多年来一直投入现金和利润，搜索高峰的轮廓似乎也很清晰。

### Microsoft 微软

Microsoft, meanwhile, seems the best placed of all. Like AWS it has a cloud service that sells GPU; it is also the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI. Yes, that is [incredibly expensive](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-openai-spent-barely-a-dime-on-microsofts-cloud-after-1-billion-deal), but given that OpenAI appears to have the inside track to being the AI epoch’s addition to this list of top tech companies, that means that Microsoft is investing in the infrastructure of that epoch.

与此同时，微软似乎处于最佳位置。像 AWS 一样，它有一个销售 GPU 的云服务；它也是 OpenAI 的独家云提供商。是的，这非常昂贵，但考虑到 OpenAI 似乎有内部轨道成为 AI 时代的顶级科技公司名单的补充，这意味着微软正在投资那个时代的基础设施。

Bing, meanwhile, is like the Mac on the eve of the iPhone: yes it contributes a fair bit of revenue, but a fraction of the dominant player, and a relatively immaterial amount in the context of Microsoft as a whole. If [incorporating ChatGPT-like results](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-working-on-chatgpt-powered-bing-in-challenge-to-google) into Bing risks the business model for the opportunity to gain massive market share, that is a bet well worth making.

与此同时，Bing 就像 iPhone 前夕的 Mac：是的，它贡献了相当多的收入，但只是占主导地位的一小部分，而且在整个微软的背景下也相对微不足道。如果将类似 ChatGPT 的结果整合到 Bing 中会冒着商业模式风险以获得巨大市场份额的机会，那么这是一个非常值得的赌注。

The [latest report from The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ghost-writer-microsoft-looks-to-add-openais-chatbot-technology-to-word-email), meanwhile, is that GPT is eventually coming to Microsoft’s productivity apps. The trick will be to imitate the success of AI-coding tool GitHub Copilot (which is built on GPT), which figured out how to be a help instead of a nuisance (i.e. don’t be Clippy!).

与此同时，The Information 的最新报告称，GPT 最终将出现在微软的生产力应用程序中。技巧将是模仿 AI 编码工具 GitHub Copilot（基于 GPT）的成功，它想出了如何成为一个帮助而不是麻烦（即不要成为 Clippy！）。

What is important is that adding on new functionality — perhaps for a fee — fits perfectly with Microsoft’s subscription business model. It is notable that the company once thought of as a poster child for victims of disruption will, in the full recounting, not just be born of disruption, but be well-placed to reach greater heights because of it.

重要的是，添加新功能——也许是收费的——完全符合微软的订阅业务模式。值得注意的是，该公司曾经被认为是颠覆受害者的典型代表，在全面的叙述中，它不仅诞生于颠覆，而且还处于有利地位，可以因此达到更高的高度。

There is so much more to write about AI’s potential impact, but this Article is already plenty long. OpenAI is obviously the most interesting from a new company perspective: it is possible that OpenAI becomes the platform on which all other AI companies are built, which would ultimately mean the economic value of AI outside of OpenAI may be fairly modest; this is also the bull case for Google, as they would be the most well-placed to be the Microsoft to OpenAI’s AWS.

关于 AI 的潜在影响还有很多可以写，但这篇文章已经很长了。从新公司的角度来看，OpenAI 显然是最有趣的：OpenAI 有可能成为所有其他 AI 公司建立的平台，这最终意味着 OpenAI 之外的 AI 的经济价值可能相当低；这也是谷歌的牛市案例，因为他们最有可能成为 OpenAI AWS 的微软。

There is another possibility where open source models proliferate in the text generation space in addition to image generation. In this world AI becomes a commodity: this is probably the most impactful outcome for the world but, paradoxically, the most muted in terms of economic impact for individual companies (I suspect the biggest opportunities will be in industries where accuracy is essential: incumbents will therefore underinvest in AI, a la Kodak under-investing in digital, forgetting that technology gets better).

除了图像生成之外，还有另一种可能性，即开源模型在文本生成空间中激增。在这个世界上，人工智能成为一种商品：这可能是对世界影响最大的结果，但矛盾的是，就个体公司的经济影响而言，这是最微弱的（我怀疑最大的机会将出现在准确性至关重要的行业：现任者将因此对人工智能的投资不足，就像柯达对数字投资不足，忘记了技术会变得更好一样）。

Indeed, the biggest winners may be Nvidia and TSMC. Nvidia’s investment in the CUDA ecosystem means the company doesn’t simply have the best AI chips, but the best AI ecosystem, and the company is [investing in scaling that ecosystem up](https://stratechery.com/2022/nvidia-in-the-valley/). That, though, has and will continue to spur competition, particularly in terms of internal chip efforts like Google’s TPU; everyone, though, will make their chips at TSMC, at least for the foreseeable future.

确实，最大的赢家可能是英伟达和台积电。 Nvidia 对 CUDA 生态系统的投资意味着该公司不仅拥有最好的 AI 芯片，还拥有最好的 AI 生态系统，并且该公司正在投资扩大该生态系统。不过，这已经并将继续刺激竞争，尤其是在谷歌 TPU 等内部芯片方面；不过，至少在可预见的未来，每个人都将在台积电生产芯片。

The biggest impact of all though, though, is probably off our radar completely. Just before the break [Nat Friedman told me in a Stratechery Interview](https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-daniel-gross-and-nat-friedman-about-chatgpt-and-the-near-term-future-of-ai/) about [Riffusion](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/riffusions-ai-generates-music-from-text-using-visual-sonograms/), which uses Stable Diffusion to generate music from text via visual sonograms, which makes me wonder what else is possible when images are truly a commodity. Right now [text is the universal interface](https://scale.com/blog/text-universal-interface), because text has been the foundation of information transfer [since the invention of writing](https://stratechery.com/2022/the-ai-unbundling/); humans, though, are visual creatures, and the availability of AI for both the creation and interpretation of images could fundamentally transform what it means to convey information in ways that are impossible to predict.

不过，最大的影响可能完全不在我们的考虑范围之内。就在休息之前，Nat Friedman 在 Stratechery 采访中告诉我 Riffusion，它使用 Stable Diffusion 通过视觉超声图从文本中生成音乐，这让我想知道当图像真正成为商品时还有什么可能。现在文本是通用界面，因为自文字发明以来，文本一直是信息传递的基础；然而，人类是视觉动物，人工智能在图像创建和解释方面的可用性可能会从根本上改变以无法预测的方式传达信息的意义。

For now, our predictions must be much more time-constrained, and modest. This may be the beginning of the AI epoch, but even in tech, epochs take a decade or longer to transform everything around them.

目前，我们的预测必须更加有时间限制和适度。这可能是人工智能时代的开始，但即使在科技领域，时代也需要十年或更长时间才能改变周围的一切。
