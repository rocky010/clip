It’s the second half of January. You may have started the new year with a vision, having identified what you want to change, created some goals, and determined next steps that align with that change.  
现在是一月下旬。您可能已经带着愿景开始了新的一年，确定了您想要改变的内容，制定了一些目标，并确定了与该变化相一致的后续步骤。  
You might even have developed a new routine, purchased a Peloton, and started a new journal. On New Year’s Day, you were off to the races, but you lost most of your steam by January 15, and you may be back to where you started by January 31.   
您甚至可能开发了新的例程，购买了 Peloton，并开始了新的日记。元旦那天，你去参加比赛，但到 1 月 15 日你失去了大部分动力，到 1 月 31 日你可能会回到起点。

According to a [2016 study](https://spsp.org/news-center/press-release/thinking-changing-your-behavior-2017-try-moving-first), 41% of Americans make a New Year’s resolution, but only 9% succeed in keeping them. Sound familiar? I know I’ve been there more than I care to admit.   
根据 2016 年的一项研究，41% 的美国人制定了新年计划，但只有 9% 的人成功地坚持了下来。听起来有点熟？我知道我去过那里的次数比我愿意承认的要多。

Why is it so hard for most of us to create lasting change?  
为什么我们大多数人很难创造持久的改变？

When we set out to change anything—ourselves, our families, our communities, our organizations—we often focus on a vision, a goal, and a plan, but we fail to account for the often invisible and internal inhibitor of change: resistance.   
当我们着手改变任何事物——我们自己、我们的家庭、我们的社区、我们的组织——时，我们通常专注于一个愿景、一个目标和一个计划，但我们没有考虑到通常是看不见的、内在的阻碍变革的因素：阻力。

## Prevailing models of change 流行的变革模式

[Kurt Lewin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Lewin), the father of change theory, was one of the first people to recognize and write about resistance, in the 1940s. He argued that in order to change, “driving forces” had to be greater than “restraining forces.” He called this [”force field analysis](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_06.htm)”:   
变革理论之父库尔特·勒温 (Kurt Lewin) 是 1940 年代最早认识并撰写有关抵抗的人之一。他认为，为了改变，“驱动力”必须大于“抑制力”。他称之为“力场分析”：

Driving forces > resisting forces = change  
驱动力 > 阻力 = 变化

Driving forces are pro-change and move you forward toward a desired state. They tend to be positive, though they don’t need to be—they could be an inspired vision, a significant financial reward, or pressure from a boss.  
驱动力是有利于改变的，它会让你朝着理想的状态前进。他们往往是积极的，尽管他们不一定是——他们可能是一个鼓舞人心的愿景，一个重要的经济回报，或者来自老板的压力。  
On the other hand, restraining forces are anti-change, and limit progress toward our desired state. They tend to be negative—an unwillingness to take risks, fear of uncertainty, and conformity to a specific way of life.  
另一方面，约束力是反变革的，限制我们朝着理想状态前进。他们往往是消极的——不愿冒险，害怕不确定性，以及从众于特定的生活方式。  
In other words, driving forces want to promote change, and restraining forces want to maintain the status quo.  
换言之，驱动力要推动变革，抑制力要维持现状。

David Gleicher, a consultant at Arthur D. Little in the 1960s, took this concept one step further with [“change equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_for_change#Attribution_confusion).” It was later adapted by [Kathie Dannemiller](https://www.dannemillertyson.com/who-we-are/dta-history/) in the 1980s and then [expanded](https://conscious.is/excercises-guides/the-change-forumla) by my teachers, Jim Dethmer and Dianna Chapman of the [Conscious Leadership Group](http://www.conscious.is/) (CLG). Collectively, they argued that for organizational and individual change to occur, three factors must be present _and_ greater than the resistance:   
1960 年代 Arthur D. Little 的顾问大卫·格莱歇尔 (David Gleicher) 通过“变化方程式”将这一概念更进一步。它后来在 1980 年代由 Kathie Dannemiller 改编，然后由我的老师，Conscious Leadership Group (CLG) 的 Jim Dethmer 和 Dianna Chapman 扩展。总的来说，他们认为要发生组织和个人变革，必须存在三个因素并且大于阻力：

(Vision x dissatisfaction) + first steps > resistance = change  
（愿景 x 不满）+ 第一步 > 阻力 = 改变

You need to be unhappy with the status quo, have an exciting vision for the future, and determine practical and concrete first steps. That’s what scores of people, myself included, identify when we want to change something.  
你需要对现状不满意，对未来有一个令人兴奋的愿景，并确定切实可行的第一步。这就是很多人，包括我自己，在我们想要改变某些事情时所确定的。  
However, Gleicher and Dannemiller argued those three factors alone don’t lead to change. Taken together, they need to be greater than the resistance of change—the “restraining forces,” as Lewin called them.  
然而，Gleicher 和 Dannemiller 认为这三个因素本身并不会导致改变。总而言之，它们需要大于变革的阻力——正如 Lewin 所说的“抑制力量”。

When I talk with clients about change, they usually want to focus exclusively on their vision, goals, and concrete actions, perhaps in the hope that these alone will make examining the “restraining forces” unnecessary.  
当我与客户谈论变革时，他们通常只想专注于他们的愿景、目标和具体行动，也许希望仅凭这些就能让审查“约束力”变得不必要。  
Why is it that we often focus on what and how we want to change, but not the obstacles that might impede us? Cultivating a vision, setting goals, and _craft_ing a plan is motivating, but thinking about all the ways in which we’re going to fail or hold ourselves back is demotivating for most.  
为什么我们经常关注我们想要改变什么以及如何改变，而不是可能阻碍我们的障碍？培养愿景、设定目标和制定计划是一种激励，但对大多数人来说，思考我们将失败或阻碍自己的所有方式是令人沮丧的。  
It’s also easy to overlook the obstacles that might stand in our way, because they’re often unconscious, we’re unwilling to look, or we simply don’t know how to discover them.  
我们也很容易忽视可能挡在我们路上的障碍，因为它们通常是无意识的，我们不愿意看，或者我们根本不知道如何发现它们。  
Most importantly, it’s much easier to remain “comfortable” and stuck than step fully into the unknown, and face our fears and big questions head-on.   
最重要的是，保持“舒适”和停滞不前比完全进入未知世界并直面我们的恐惧和重大问题要容易得多。

There’s another reason why facing our obstacles to change isn’t so common. I believe these prevailing _models_ are flawed.  
面对我们的变革障碍并不常见还有另一个原因。我相信这些流行的模型是有缺陷的。

## The fatal flaw 致命缺陷

Humans and our behavior cannot be reduced to a linear equation. How we and our lives unfold and evolve is not linear, so fitting our dreams, behaviors, and limitations into a neat equation is reductionist.  
人类和我们的行为不能简化为线性方程。我们和我们的生活如何展开和演变不是线性的，因此将我们的梦想、行为和限制放入一个简洁的等式中是还原论者。  
We’re highly complex creatures moving through a highly complex and interdependent world. We’re constantly changing and in transition along with everything around us. [Everything is impermanent](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/course/C60C3D?source=content%20share&share_id=744EC586&pack=P3A339&code=SC5F5B430), multivariable, and in flux.   
我们是高度复杂的生物，在高度复杂且相互依存的世界中穿行。我们和周围的一切都在不断变化和转变。一切都是无常的、多变的和不断变化的。

Your experience of change has most likely always been non-linear—hence the saying “one step forward, two steps back.” We have fits and starts, setbacks, disappointments, triumphs, more setbacks, followed by more triumphs, and so on.  
您的变革经历很可能一直是非线性的——因此才有“前进一步，后退两步”的说法。我们时好时坏，挫折，失望，胜利，更多的挫折，接着是更多的胜利，等等。  
We’re also influenced by our inner experience—thoughts, habits, patterns, emotions, sensations—as well as external forces—people, places, ideas, situations—and how we _choose to_ respond to these shape our context and understanding of the world. That’s life. Life is messy and perfectly imperfect, just like us.   
我们也受到我们的内在体验——思想、习惯、模式、情绪、感觉——以及外在力量——人、地方、想法、情况——的影响，以及我们选择如何回应这些影响我们的背景和对世界的理解.这就是生活。就像我们一样，生活是混乱且完美的。

But the old thinking is wrong. The models of change we have make the assertion that as long as we have motivating forces, [the parts of ourselves](https://jameshollis.net/) that create resistance don’t matter; motivation by itself is enough. But we can’t fully move on if there are parts of ourselves we reject and repress. They will hold us back unless we accept them and agree to carry them lovingly with us.  
但是旧的想法是错误的。我们所拥有的变革模型断言，只要我们有动力，我们自己产生阻力的部分就无关紧要；动机本身就足够了。但是，如果我们拒绝和压抑自己的某些部分，我们就无法完全前进。他们会阻止我们，除非我们接受他们并同意带着他们亲切地陪伴我们。

To focus on and optimize for “driving forces” or to be “at war” with resistance is doing ourselves a disservice because we’re ignoring, disowning, or battling conscious and unconscious parts of ourselves.  
专注于并优化“驱动力”或与阻力“交战”是在伤害自己，因为我们忽视、否认或与自己有意识和无意识的部分作斗争。  
To prioritize these motivating forces or one side of the equation is to deprioritize parts of ourselves that have wisdom and something to share. The idea that all you need is motivation is a rejection of the self.  
优先考虑这些激励力量或等式的一方面就是取消我们自己有智慧和可以分享的部分的优先次序。你所需要的只是动力的想法是拒绝自我。

Philosopher Alan Watts understood this when [he wrote](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7160801-to-put-it-still-more-plainly-the-desire-for-security), “I can only think seriously of trying to live up to an ideal, to improve myself, if I am split in two pieces. There must be a good ‘I’ who is going to improve the bad ‘me.  
哲学家艾伦·瓦茨 (Alan Watts) 明白了这一点，他写道：“如果我被分成两部分，我只能认真考虑努力实现理想，提高自己。必须有一个好的“我”来改善坏的“我”。  
’ ‘I,’ who has the best intentions, will go to work on wayward ‘me,’ and the tussle between the two will very much stress the difference between them.  
’心存善意的‘我’会去工作任性的‘我’，两者之间的较量会非常强调他们之间的差异。  
Consequently ‘I’ will feel more separate than ever, and so merely increase the lonely and cut-off feelings which make ‘me’ behave so badly.”   
因此，“我”会感到比以往任何时候都更加孤立，因此只会增加使“我”表现如此糟糕的孤独感和孤立感。”

I believe that we need to understand and appreciate the parts of us that resist as much as we understand and appreciate the elements on the other side of the equation.  
我相信我们需要理解和欣赏我们抵抗的部分，就像我们理解和欣赏等式另一边的元素一样。  
If we spend more time with resistance, honoring whatever we find, it will lead to greater self-understanding and acceptance—the true first steps to sustained transformational change.  
如果我们花更多的时间抵抗阻力，尊重我们发现的一切，这将导致更好的自我理解和接受——这是持续转型变革的真正第一步。

## So what is resistance, really? 那么什么是阻力，真的吗？

Resistance is a mentally constructed force that resists change, evolution, and creation. It’s what stops us in our tracks when we’re moving toward a desired future state. Julia Cameron, author of [_The Artist’s Way_](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-artist-s-way-30th-anniversary-edition-julia-cameron/6665657), refers to it as “a form of self-destruction” that we resort to “to maintain an illusion of control.” Most of the time resistance originates within us, even though we _think_ it comes from external sources like family, the weather, a disempowering boss, or a schedule. It wants us to maintain the status quo, so it keeps us comfortable and makes us feel safe in the moment, even if staying still isn’t what we _really_ want. We often see this resistance as conscious and logical, but it's not.   
阻力是一种心理建构的力量，它抵制变化、进化和创造。当我们朝着理想的未来状态前进时，这就是阻止我们前进的原因。 《艺术家之路》一书的作者朱莉娅卡梅隆将其称为“一种自我毁灭的形式”，我们诉诸于“以维持一种控制的幻觉”。大多数时候，阻力来自我们内心，尽管我们认为它来自外部来源，如家庭、天气、一个无能为力的老板或一个日程安排。它希望我们保持现状，所以它让我们感到舒适，让我们在当下感到安全，即使保持静止并不是我们真正想要的。我们经常认为这种抵制是有意识和合乎逻辑的，但事实并非如此。

When we fail to consciously recognize what stands between us and the change we want to make, we remain stuck in “the life we live” rather than the life we want—the unlived one buried deep within our soul.  
当我们无法有意识地认识到我们和我们想要做出的改变之间的障碍时，我们就会陷入“我们过的生活”而不是我们想要的生活——深埋在我们灵魂深处的未过的生活。  
But we can’t change or create something new until we know what’s holding us back and what we’re afraid of. No one is immune to resistance. We all face it in our lives and within ourselves.   
但是，在我们知道是什么阻碍了我们以及我们害怕什么之前，我们无法改变或创造新事物。没有人能够抵抗抵抗。我们都在生活中和内心面对它。

Through my experience transforming myself and coaching countless leaders, most people instinctively know _something_ is holding them back, but can’t quite make sense of what’s going on. They can see that they’re not making meaningful progress, but they don’t fully understand why. They might say, _here we go again_ because it’s a familiar pattern and result. Sometimes we have a conscious aversion to or fear of change, and other times we want to change—but some underlying traits, beliefs, and habits that are below our level of consciousness hold us back.   
通过我改变自己和指导无数领导者的经历，大多数人本能地知道有什么东西阻碍了他们，但不能完全理解正在发生的事情。他们可以看到他们没有取得有意义的进展，但他们并不完全理解原因。他们可能会说，我们又来了，因为这是一个熟悉的模式和结果。有时我们有意识地厌恶或害怕改变，而其他时候我们想要改变——但一些低于我们意识水平的潜在特征、信念和习惯阻碍了我们。

[Robert Kegan](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/robert-kegan), a Harvard psychologist and a father of [adult development theory](https://medium.com/@NataliMorad/how-to-be-an-adult-kegans-theory-of-adult-development-d63f4311b553), called these unconscious blockers an “immunity to change.” In other words, unpacking resistance is difficult, and often requires the help of others to see what’s hidden below the surface. Decades before Keegan coined that phrase, Carl Jung famously [wrote](https://www.amazon.com/Aion-Researches-Phenomenology-Collected-Works/dp/1138136565), “When an inner situation is not made conscious, it happens outside, as fate.”   
哈佛大学心理学家、成人发展理论之父罗伯特·凯根 (Robert Kegan) 将这些无意识的障碍称为“改变的免疫力”。换句话说，揭开阻力是困难的，往往需要他人的帮助才能看到隐藏在表面之下的东西。在 Keegan 创造这句话的几十年前，Carl Jung 写道：“当一种内在情况没有被意识到时，它就会发生在外部，就像命运一样。”

If you want to change and create that unlived life you’ve been dreaming about, you must be willing to look in the mirror and investigate _your_ resistance. This isn’t for the faint of heart. To fully understand the inhibitors to change, you’ll need to [shine a light on your shadow](https://www.reboot.io/episode/51-the-love-that-heals-shadow-james-hollis/), which, according to Jungian analyst [James Hollis](https://jameshollis.net/), is “those parts of ourselves that when brought into consciousness we find troubling, maybe they’re troubling because they’re contradictory to our values, maybe they’re troubling because they violate our expectations, sometimes they're troubling because they ask things of us that are uncomfortable.  
如果你想改变并创造你梦寐以求的空虚生活，你必须愿意照照镜子并调查你的阻力。这不适合胆小的人。要完全理解改变的阻碍因素，你需要照亮你的影子，根据荣格分析师詹姆斯霍利斯的说法，它是“我们自己的那些部分，当我们意识到这些部分时，我们会发现它令人不安，也许它们令人不安是因为它们与我们的价值观相矛盾，也许它们令人不安是因为它们违背了我们的期望，有时它们令人不安是因为它们要求我们做一些让我们不舒服的事情。  
”

Dr. Richard Schwartz, the creator of an evidence-based psychotherapy called Internal Family Systems (IFS), [explained](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/168349.Internal_Family_Systems_Therapy) in his book on the subject, “A part is not just a temporary emotional state or habitual thought pattern. Instead, it is a discrete and autonomous mental system that has an idiosyncratic range of emotion, style of expression, set of abilities, desires, and view of the world.  
Richard Schwartz 博士是一种名为内部家庭系统 (IFS) 的循证心理疗法的创始人，他在他关于这个主题的书中解释说，“一部分不仅仅是暂时的情绪状态或习惯性思维模式。相反，它是一个离散和自主的心理系统，具有特殊的情感范围、表达方式、能力、欲望和世界观。  
\[It\] is as if we each contain a society of people, each of whom is at a different age and has different interests, talents, and temperaments.”  
\[它\]就好像我们每个人都包含一个人的社会，每个人都处于不同的年龄，有着不同的兴趣、才能和气质。”

The shadow "parts" that Hollis describes operate autonomously and furtively, and were once helpful strategies that we learned earlier in life, often to cope with trauma or respond to traumatic events, like neglectful parents at home or bullying at school.  
霍利斯描述的影子“部分”自主和偷偷摸摸地运作，曾经是我们早年学到的有用策略，通常用于应对创伤或应对创伤性事件，例如家中疏忽的父母或学校的欺凌行为。  
When these parts get activated in adulthood, we often experience anxiety, tension, or inner conflict. Change is so hard because stepping into a bigger and more liberated life is threatening to these parts in different ways.  
当这些部分在成年后被激活时，我们经常会感到焦虑、紧张或内心冲突。改变是如此艰难，因为踏入更大、更自由的生活会以不同的方式威胁到这些部分。  
Change often alters who we are at our very core, and those identities will resist that change to preserve themselves and their patterns.   
变化通常会改变我们的核心身份，而这些身份会抵制这种变化以保护自己和他们的模式。

I experienced this conflict when I was leaving the investment profession to become a coach. There were a variety of parts, including the one that craved money to feel safe, that were telling me it would be a disaster if I were to leave venture capital in favor of coaching.   
当我离开投资行业成为一名教练时，我经历了这种冲突。有各种各样的部分，包括渴望金钱来获得安全感的部分，告诉我如果我离开风险投资转而支持教练，那将是一场灾难。

Despite this, all parts, particularly our protector ones that create resistance, have a positive intention. They want to keep us safe, accepted, comfortable, and in control—all things that every human being wants and needs on a primal level.  
尽管如此，所有部分，尤其是我们产生阻力的保护器部分，都有积极的意图。他们想让我们保持安全、被接受、舒适和掌控——所有这些都是每个人在原始层面上想要和需要的东西。  
When these parts get activated, they are simply doing a job that they learned earlier in life and are trying to help us, even if it doesn't seem that way now.  
当这些部分被激活时，它们只是在做他们早年学到的工作，并试图帮助我们，即使现在看起来并非如此。

When we ignore, repress, and disown the parts that cause resistance, we allow them to unconsciously run the show and rob us of what we truly want. We let them keep us in our status quo, or moving backward. We get stuck. We get scared. We stay small.  
当我们忽视、压抑和否定引起抵抗的部分时，我们就让它们在不知不觉中发挥作用，抢走了我们真正想要的东西。我们让他们让我们保持现状，或者倒退。我们卡住了。我们害怕。我们保持小。  
We lose confidence in ourselves. We shame ourselves. We numb ourselves. We remain polarized. We start and quit—a lot!  
我们对自己失去信心。我们羞辱自己。我们麻木自己。我们仍然两极分化。我们开始和退出——很多！

No matter how much a future vision of your life is motivating you, no matter how dissatisfied you are now, you can't force out resistance. Doing so would mean either unconsciously ignoring it, or consciously rejecting parts of yourself that are actually trying to help you.  
无论你对未来生活的愿景有多大的动力，无论你现在有多不满意，你都无法强迫自己抗拒。这样做将意味着要么无意识地忽略它，要么有意识地拒绝你自己实际上试图帮助你的部分。  
Instead, you have to open the door, invite those parts in, ask them questions, appreciate how they’re trying to help you, and eventually choose how you want to move forward.  
相反，你必须打开大门，邀请这些人进来，向他们提问，感谢他们如何努力帮助你，并最终选择你想要前进的方式。

So what is resistance, really? It’s the unconscious and conscious parts of ourselves that hold us back. To begin the change process, we need to understand the types of resistance and how to work _with_ them.  
那么什么是阻力，真的吗？阻碍我们前进的是我们自己的无意识和有意识的部分。要开始变革过程，我们需要了解阻力的类型以及如何应对它们。

## The types of resistance 抵抗的类型

Many of us have between 30-50 parts, and a number of them create resistance. It is not uncommon for different parts of our psyche to resist change, particularly when those parts have different goals, motivations, or roles to play.  
我们中的许多人都有 30-50 个零件，其中一些零件会产生阻力。我们心理的不同部分抵制变化的情况并不少见，尤其是当这些部分有不同的目标、动机或要扮演的角色时。  
In some cases, the different parts may work independently. In other cases, the different parts may team up and work together to resist change. In still others, the different parts may be in opposition to each other, leading to inner conflicts and instability.  
在某些情况下，不同的部分可能独立工作。在其他情况下，不同的部分可能会联合起来共同抵制变化。在另一些情况下，不同的部分可能相互对立，导致内部冲突和不稳定。  
Ultimately, the ability of a system to adapt and change will depend on the nature of the interactions between its various parts.  
最终，系统适应和改变的能力将取决于其各个部分之间相互作用的性质。

Over the past 18 months, I’ve learned “parts work” from Steve March of coaching instruction [Aletheia](https://integralunfoldment.com/) and Jim and Dianna of CLG. I’ve also devoured a dozen books on the topic, including [_Internal Family Systems Therapy_](https://www.amazon.com/Internal-Family-Systems-Therapy-Second-ebook/dp/B07RY4GZJN/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1XS9J7PFXITC8&keywords=internal+family+systems&qid=1671215930&s=books&sprefix=internal+family+systems,stripbooks,63&sr=1-5) by Dr. Richard Schwartz, [_Self-Therapy for Your Inner Critic_](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Therapy-Your-Inner-Critic-Self-Confidence/dp/0984392718) by Jay Earley, and [_Big Mind Big Heart_](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=big+heart+big+mind&i=stripbooks&crid=S25PL3P5WWW7&sprefix=big+heart+big+mind+,stripbooks,70) by Dennis Genpo Merzel. Through this work, I’ve come to understand and appreciate that all of us have a constellation of parts that create resistance.  
在过去的 18 个月里，我从教练指导 Aletheia 的 Steve March 以及 CLG 的 Jim 和 Dianna 那里学到了“部分工作”。我还阅读了十几本关于这个主题的书，包括 Richard Schwartz 博士的《内部家庭系统疗法》、Jay Earley 的《针对内心批评家的自我疗法》和 Dennis Genpo Merzel 的《Big Mind Big Heart》。通过这项工作，我开始理解并意识到我们所有人都有一系列会产生阻力的部分。

Here are some of them and what they might have to say:   
以下是他们中的一些人以及他们可能要说的话：

**Critic:** _Just give up. You’re not capable of doing this. You don’t have what it takes. You’re not attractive enough. You’re not good enough. This work is not good enough. You’re not smart enough. You’re not talented enough. You’re a failure. You’re not worthy. You’ll never be successful._   
评论家：放弃吧。你没有能力做到这一点。你没有它需要的东西。你不够有吸引力。你还不够好。这项工作还不够好。你不够聪明。你不够有才华。你是个失败者。你不配。你永远不会成功。

**Procrastinator: 拖延者：** _I have too much going on. This can wait. I’ll just get to this tomorrow or later this week. I just can’t fit it in or make the time. Ugh, I just don’t have the motivation right now, and the conditions aren’t perfect or ideal.  
我有太多事情要做。这个可以等等。我明天或本周晚些时候再谈这个。我只是无法适应或抽出时间。呃，我只是现在没有动力，而且条件也不完美或不理想。  
Actually, next week is much better for me to start because I’ll have less going on in my life.  
实际上，下周开始对我来说要好得多，因为我的生活会少一些。_

**Rebel:** _Just this one time. It’s not that big of a deal. YOLO. You can’t tell me what to do. In fact, I hate being told what to do. I march to the beat of my own drum. Rules? What rules? LOL._   
Rebel：就这一次。这没什么大不了的。约洛。你不能告诉我该怎么做。事实上，我讨厌被告知该做什么。我按照自己的鼓点行进。规则？什么规则？哈哈。

**Cynic/underminer:** _This isn’t going to work out. There’s a 0% chance you’re going to succeed. Do you even know what this entails? You don’t have the skills or the knowledge. Don’t even bother. There’s no point in trying. You have so many other things going on. You’re just fooling yourself._  
愤世嫉俗者/破坏者：这是行不通的。您成功的可能性为 0%。你知道这意味着什么吗？你没有技能或知识。别费心了。尝试是没有意义的。你还有很多其他事情要做。你只是在自欺欺人。

**Controller:  控制器：**_Let’s closely manage and monitor this. Actually, let’s put in some rules and guardrails to make sure that we comply. What are you doing? You said you weren’t going to do that, and here we are again. Why does this keep happening? You need to step up your game.  
让我们密切管理和监控这一点。实际上，让我们制定一些规则和护栏以确保我们遵守。你在干嘛？你说你不打算那样做，我们又来了。为什么这种情况不断发生？你需要加强你的游戏。  
We’re out of control right now.  
我们现在失控了。_

**_Self-reliance:_** _I can’t possibly ask for help or trust anyone else with this. I need to do it all by myself. This is all on me. I need to put it on my back. can’t seem weak or incompetent. Oh, this is getting hard. I’m carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders._     
自力更生：在这方面我不可能寻求帮助或相信任何人。我需要自己做这一切。这一切都在我身上。我需要把它放在我的背上。不能显得软弱或无能。哦，这越来越难了。我肩负着世界的重担。

**Dummy:** _This is so hard to understand and grasp. I can’t wrap my head around any of this. I’m just not that smart. I never understood this and I can’t figure it out so there’s point in trying. It’s way over my head. I feel so dumb. I’ll never be able to learn this._   
假人：这太难理解和掌握了。我无法理解这些。我只是没那么聪明。我从来不明白这一点，我也想不通，所以尝试是有意义的。这超出了我的理解范围。我觉得很愚蠢。我永远学不会这个。

**Guilt-tripper:  罪恶感：**_What’s wrong with you? You say you really want this but your actions speak otherwise. You haven’t gotten off your butt. You shouldn’t have done that again. Just close your mouth and don’t move your body. Just stop. You should have done this differently.  
你这人怎么回事？你说你真的想要这个，但你的行为却不是这样。你还没有摆脱困境。你不应该再这样做了。闭上你的嘴，不要移动你的身体。停下来。你应该以不同的方式做到这一点。  
What the hell is going on with you?   
你到底是怎么回事？_

**Perfectionist:** _This isn’t good enough. You aren’t good enough. There are too many mistakes. It’s not perfect. Do you see all of these blemishes and mistakes? To be the best you need to dramatically raise your standards. Let’s be honest, you’re not doing enough._   
完美主义者：这还不够好。你还不够好。错误太多了。这并不完美。你看到所有这些瑕疵和错误了吗？要想成为最好的，你需要大幅提高你的标准。老实说，你做得还不够。

**Denial:** _You know what? After thinking about it, I don’t really need to change. It’s really not that big of a problem and I actually feel fine. In fact, I think this actually helps me and gives me an edge. Just forget about it for now._  
否认：你知道吗？想了想，其实也不需要改变。这真的不是什么大问题，我实际上感觉很好。事实上，我认为这实际上帮助了我并给了我优势。暂时忘掉它吧。

**Taskmaster:** _You’re slacking. Pick up the pace. You gotta work harder, and can’t quit. You’re falling behind and there are a million things to do. You should work_ _hard and be successful through criticism._  
工头：你偷懒了。加快脚步。你必须更加努力地工作，不能放弃。你落后了，有一百万件事要做。你应该努力工作，通过批评获得成功。 

**Impatience: 不耐烦：** _I’ve been working on this for weeks and I haven’t seen any progress. I’m still the same person. I don’t feel any different or look any different. It seems like I’m just spinning my wheels, going in circles and wasting my time. I’m exactly where I started. This isn’t for me.  
我已经为此工作了数周，但我没有看到任何进展。我还是同一个人。我没有任何不同或看起来有任何不同。好像我只是在旋转我的轮子，在原地打转，浪费我的时间。我正是我开始的地方。这不适合我。  
Let’s abandon ship, move on, and focus on something else.     
让我们放弃船，继续前进，专注于其他事情。_

**_Conformer: 符合者：_** _What are other people doing? I should do that. Don’t worry about what you really want. Let’s look a certain way for my friends, family and colleagues. In fact, let’s just go with the flow, maintain the status quo, and follow what others are doing.  
其他人在做什么？我应该那样做。不要担心你真正想要的是什么。让我们以某种方式看待我的朋友、家人和同事。其实，顺其自然，安于现状，随波逐流。  
Imitation is the greatest form of flattery, right?   
模仿是最大的奉承，对吧？_

**Destroyer:** _Why even bother? You’re way in over your head. You’re unworthy, deficient and clearly not enough. Just give up and throw in the towel._   
毁灭者：何必呢？你太过分了。你不值得，有缺陷，显然还不够。放弃并认输。

**Bypasser:** _Let’s get high or drunk. Netflix and chill, anyone? I don’t want to feel anything so let’s meditate and let everything just melt away. Let’s go shopping—a little retail therapy never hurt anyone. Who wants ice cream?_    
旁观者：让我们嗨起来或喝醉。 Netflix 和 chill，有人吗？我不想有任何感觉，所以让我们冥想，让一切都消失。让我们去购物吧——一点购物疗法不会伤害任何人。谁想要冰淇淋？ 

**Planner: 规划师：** _I’m not ready but one day I will be. Before I can really get started, I need to develop the right plan, cultivate the right skills, purchase the right tools, and build the right network. I can’t possibly start until all those things are in place.  
我还没准备好，但总有一天我会的。在我真正开始之前，我需要制定正确的计划、培养正确的技能、购买正确的工具并建立正确的网络。在所有这些事情都到位之前，我不可能开始。  
Let’s start planning now, and I’ll be ready in a few years time.   
让我们现在就开始计划吧，我会在几年后准备好。_

If you’re human, you likely experienced these resistor parts when you’ve wanted to make a change. All of these parts have a good intention and are trying to proactively or reactively protect us from painful feelings such as deficiency, unworthiness, and brokenness.  
如果你是人类，当你想要做出改变时，你可能会遇到这些电阻器部件。所有这些部分都有良好的意图，并试图主动或被动地保护我们免受诸如缺乏、无价值和破碎等痛苦的感觉。  
And even though they’re trying to help us, they activate other parts that are laden with shame and guilt.  
即使他们试图帮助我们，他们也会激活其他充满羞耻和内疚的部分。  
So when we let the resistors run wild without understanding, appreciating, and valuing them, we feel broken and loathe ourselves, sometimes subconsciously, and sometimes very consciously. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle.   
因此，当我们让阻力狂奔而不理解、欣赏和重视它们时，我们会感到沮丧和厌恶自己，有时是下意识的，有时是非常有意识的。这创造了一个自我延续的循环。

For years I instinctively knew I had issues with cannabis and thought I wanted to get clean, but kept it to myself. I had an inner polarization—a part that wanted to get sober but a constellation of other parts that kept me stuck.  
多年来，我本能地知道我对大麻有问题，并认为我想变得干净，但我自己保留了它。我有一个内在的两极分化——一个想要变得清醒的部分，但其他部分的组合让我陷入困境。  
This created an inner stalemate because there was a lack of understanding, trust, and appreciation among the parts. There was a fearful part that was afraid to come clean to my wife. _Would she leave me? What would she think?_ There were other parts who couldn’t imagine a life without substances. _Could I have fun? How will I go to work events? Would I lose my friends? What will others think of me if I don’t drink? Could I even cope and survive?_ Every Sunday night the part of me who wanted to get sober would say, “I’ve had enough. I’m done.” But by Monday night I’d be stoned because my rebel was running wild unchecked, saying, _It’s only weed. Just one more time_. And then I’d shame and guilt myself for perpetuating the addiction.   
这造成了内部僵局，因为各部分之间缺乏理解、信任和欣赏。有一个可怕的部分害怕向我的妻子坦白。她会离开我吗？她会怎么想？还有一些人无法想象没有物质的生活。我可以玩得开心吗？我将如何参加工作活动？我会失去我的朋友吗？如果我不喝酒，别人会怎么看我？我什至可以应付并生存吗？每个星期天晚上，我内心想要清醒的部分都会说：“我受够了。我受够了。”但到了周一晚上，我会被扔石头，因为我的叛逆者肆无忌惮地狂奔，说，这只是杂草。就再一次。然后我会因为持续上瘾而感到羞耻和内疚。

I was programmed to seek substances from a young age because they numbed me, gave me comfort, and helped me escape reality.  
我从小就被安排去寻找物质，因为它们麻木了我，给我安慰，帮助我逃避现实。  
I was scared of giving all of this up even though there were real costs to my usage—chronic health issues, integrity breaches, anxiety, a void of coping mechanisms.  
我害怕放弃所有这一切，即使我的使用有实际成本——慢性健康问题、诚信违规、焦虑、应对机制的无效。  
At a certain point, the cost and pain of substance abuse outweighed these fears, and the certainty that I needed to get sober allowed me to begin to accept the parts of myself that were afraid and rationalizing my drug use.  
在某一时刻，药物滥用的代价和痛苦超过了这些恐惧，我需要清醒的确定性让我开始接受自己害怕的部分，并使我的药物使用合理化。  
The first step in AA after all is, “We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable."  As I look back, I see and appreciate that there were about a dozen parts activated during those years in my life.   
毕竟 AA 的第一步是，“我们承认我们对酒精无能为力——我们的生活变得无法控制。”当我回顾过去时，我看到并意识到在我生命中的那些年里，大约有十几个部分被激活了。

My other big resistance journey has been in writing. I started [my blog](http://schlaf.me/) in 2011, and would journal every few months despite feeling a deep desire to write daily and devote myself to the _craft_. I would purchase journals and fancy pens only to have them sit empty and unused on my shelf. I had a part that would tell me stories that I believed. _You don’t have the time. Writing isn’t that important. You’re a slow writer. It’s just wasting time. You’re going to lose your edge as an investor if you’re not taking as many meetings. Let’s start that new journal habit tomorrow._ Resistance had me in its grip for nearly 12 years.   
我的另一大阻力之旅是写作。我在 2011 年开始写博客，尽管我非常渴望每天写作并投身于这门手艺，但每隔几个月就会写一篇日记。我会购买日记本和花哨的钢笔，结果却让它们空着闲置在我的架子上。我有一部分会告诉我我相信的故事。你没有时间。写作没那么重要。你是一个慢作家。这只是在浪费时间。如果你不参加尽可能多的会议，你将失去作为投资者的优势。让我们明天开始新的日记习惯吧。抵抗运动控制了我将近 12 年。

These resistors still show up daily in my life, even though I have all the tools and am committed to [radical self-inquiry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiSEjnep40A). Right now, there’s a part of me that wants to work out more, and there is an army of parts that is holding me back from that goal.  
这些阻力仍然每天都出现在我的生活中，尽管我拥有所有的工具并且致力于彻底的自我探究。现在，我的一部分想要锻炼更多，但有一大群人在阻止我实现这个目标。  
There’s a part of me that wants to pivot my coaching business to focus exclusively on founders and leaders in transition, and another part who’s afraid to walk away from my existing thriving and profitable coaching practice.  
我的一部分想要将我的教练业务重点放在转型中的创始人和领导者身上，而另一部分则害怕放弃我现有的蓬勃发展和有利可图的教练实践。  
The opportunity to know yourself better by honoring all of your parts is a daily practice and a lifelong pursuit.   
通过尊重自己的所有部分来更好地了解自己的机会是一种日常实践和终生追求。

These thoughts your resistor parts share with you are not necessarily true, and you need to be kind and compassionate towards oneself.  
你的电阻零件与你分享的这些想法不一定是真的，你需要对自己友善和富有同情心。  
It is also important to find healthy ways to manage and challenge these thoughts, rather than letting them control your actions and self-perception.  
找到健康的方法来管理和挑战这些想法也很重要，而不是让它们控制您的行为和自我认知。  
Finally, recognize that these thoughts may be motivated by a desire to avoid discomfort or stress in the short term, but resisting these parts of us can lead to more stress and discomfort in the long term.   
最后，要认识到这些想法可能是出于在短期内避免不适或压力的愿望，但从长远来看，抵制我们的这些部分可能会导致更多的压力和不适。

All resistance isn’t counterproductive or negative. You may be feeling resistance for good reasons, like someone else wants you to make a change and you know it's wrong for you, or when you’re not ready to make the change emotionally even though you are intellectually.  
所有阻力都不会适得其反或消极。您可能出于充分的理由而感到抵制，例如其他人希望您做出改变而您知道这对您来说是错误的，或者即使您在理智上还没有准备好在情感上做出改变。  
Discerning the difference is an important yet difficult skill to master.   
辨别差异是一项重要但难以掌握的技能。

## Shining a light on resistance  点亮抵抗运动

Identifying and getting to know your resistance, especially the parts that get triggered and stop you in your tracks, is how you’ll begin to go beyond what you thought was possible, and appreciate and relate to yourself more fully.  
识别并了解你的阻力，尤其是那些被触发并阻止你前进的部分，你将如何开始超越你认为可能的，并更充分地欣赏和与自己联系。  
With practice and presence, you’ll see that different types of resistance emerge depending on the situation and context—what you’re doing, who you’re with, what’s at stake, etc. In other words, resistance is fluid, dynamic, and slippery.  
通过练习和在场，你会发现不同类型的阻力会根据情况和背景出现——你在做什么，你和谁在一起，有什么利害关系等等。换句话说，阻力是流动的、动态的，和滑。  
Yes, it’s difficult to nail down, but it’s not impossible.  
是的，很难确定，但这并非不可能。

Start by identifying what you want to change, what you desire in life, and what that looks like. Once that’s identified, you can begin to tune into all the ways in which resistance presents itself and you sabotage yourself.  
首先确定你想要改变什么，你在生活中渴望什么，以及那是什么样子。一旦确定了这一点，您就可以开始调整阻力出现的所有方式以及您破坏自己的方式。  
Do you move closer or farther away from your goal, or do you remain stuck? This requires self-observation and self-awareness—to look at your behaviors and personality patterns.   
你是离目标更近了还是更远了，还是停滞不前？这需要自我观察和自我意识——看看你的行为和性格模式。

Before you get started, I recommend finding a therapist or coach with proper training and experience, especially if you have a history of mental illness or trauma. Opening these doors without professional guidance can surface difficult and repressed emotions and thoughts.  
在你开始之前，我建议你找一位受过适当训练和有经验的治疗师或教练，尤其是如果你有精神疾病或创伤史。在没有专业指导的情况下打开这些门可能会使困难和压抑的情绪和想法浮出水面。  
Make sure you talk with your doctor, therapist, or coach to ensure it’s appropriate. And remember to seek support if old traumas are uncovered or you become triggered during parts work at home.  
请务必与您的医生、治疗师或教练交谈，以确保它是合适的。如果发现旧创伤或您在家做零件时被触发，请记住寻求支持。

That said, here are a variety of approaches and techniques to help you get started. As you go through these practices, I encourage you to get curious and compassionate.  
也就是说，这里有多种方法和技术可以帮助您入门。当你完成这些练习时，我鼓励你变得好奇和富有同情心。  
None of these is a panacea, but they will help you increase self-awareness, which will enable you to play a more conscious and compassionate role in the change process.  
这些都不是灵丹妙药，但它们会帮助你提高自我意识，这将使你能够在变革过程中发挥更自觉和富有同情心的角色。

### Discovering your resistor parts 发现您的电阻器零件

Start by slowing down, getting present, and noticing your thoughts when you picture the change you desire, or you catch yourself in the act of behaviors that are counter to that change. What’s the content? What words are entering into your awareness? What’s their tone?  
当您想象自己想要的改变时，先放慢脚步，活在当下，注意自己的想法，否则您会陷入与这种改变背道而驰的行为中。内容是什么？哪些词正在进入你的意识？他们的语气是什么？  
How do you react to your thoughts?   
你对你的想法有什么反应？

Parts have different energetic qualities. When you notice a shift in your energy and aliveness, it’s likely a sign that a different part has come online and you’re identifying with it. Here are some questions you can ask yourself: Am I upbeat? Drained? Focused? Scattered?  
零件具有不同的能量品质。当您注意到自己的能量和活力发生变化时，这可能表明不同的部分已经上线并且您正在认同它。以下是您可以问自己的一些问题：我乐观吗？排干？专注？疏散？  
Restless? What’s the quality of my attention and energy right now?  
不安？我现在的注意力和精力质量如何？

Parts are often behind emotions and body sensations. Are you happy? Sad? Tired? Irritated at yourself? Guilty about something? Filled with anxiety? What’s your posture? Are you open and upright or closed and slouched?  
部分通常是情绪和身体感觉的背后。你快乐吗？伤心？疲劳的？生自己的气？对某事感到内疚？充满焦虑？你的姿势是什么？你是开放和直立还是封闭和无精打采？  
Do you feel twisting in your stomach or tightness in your shoulders? What’s your body temperature? Are you cold or hot? When we notice an emotion or a sensation, we can usually find a part behind it. From that place, inquiry and understanding can unfold.  
您是否感到腹部绞痛或肩膀紧绷？你的体温是多少？你冷还是热？当我们注意到一种情绪或一种感觉时，我们通常可以找到它背后的原因。从那个地方，探究和理解可以展开。

The resistor parts that get activated depend on a variety of factors, including your inner and outer context. Not all types of resistance are created equal, and they might show up at different times and points in the change process.  
被激活的电阻部分取决于多种因素，包括你的内在和外在环境。并非所有类型的阻力都是平等的，它们可能会在变化过程中的不同时间和点出现。  
You might be in a storm of parts and struggle to discern which is which.  
您可能身处零件风暴中，难以辨别哪个是哪个。

Once you identify a part and make contact with it, you can ask it a variety of questions to get to know it better:  
一旦您识别出一个部件并与之接触，您可以向它提出各种问题以更好地了解它：

-   How do you (the part) feel right now?    
    你（角色）现在感觉如何？
-   What’s your job?  你的工作是什么？
-   How do you protect and serve me?  
    你如何保护和服务我？
-   When did you make your first appearance in my life?   
    你什么时候第一次出现在我的生活中？
-   Who in your life did you learn your style from?    
    在你的生活中，你的风格是从谁那里学来的？
-   What feelings are you protecting me from feeling?   
    你在保护我免受什么感觉？
-   What behaviors and strategies do you use to protect me from feeling this way?   
    你用什么行为和策略来保护我免受这种感觉？
-   What’s your superpower?     你的超能力是什么？
-   What role do you want to play going forward?  
    你想在未来扮演什么角色？
-   What do you want me to know about the topic at hand?  
    关于手头的话题，你想让我知道什么？

I recommend journaling for this practice, especially if you don’t have someone to practice with. Simply note your experience and whatever words, images, emotions, or body sensations come to the surface.  
我建议为这种练习写日记，尤其是当你没有人一起练习的时候。只需记下你的经历，以及浮出水面的任何文字、图像、情绪或身体感觉。  
The point of this exercise is to increase your understanding of and compassion for your parts so you can build a new relationship with them until they’re no longer unconsciously running your life.  
这个练习的目的是增加你对你的部分的理解和同情，这样你就可以与他们建立新的关系，直到他们不再无意识地掌控你的生活。  
Once they feel seen and appreciated, they will often soften and fade in the background.  
一旦他们感到被看到和欣赏，他们通常会软化并淡出背景。

### Look for your comfort zone 寻找你的舒适区

In their book [_The Tools_](https://www.thetoolsbook.com/), Barry Michels and Phil Stuz present a useful exercise: “Pick something you hate doing. It could be traveling, meeting new people, family gatherings, etc.. How do you organize your life so you can avoid doing it? Imagine that pattern is a place you hide in.  
Barry Michels 和 Phil Stuz 在他们的《工具》一书中提出了一个有用的练习：“选择你讨厌做的事情。可能是旅行、结识新朋友、家庭聚会等。你如何安排你的生活以避免这样做？想象那个图案是你藏身的地方。  
That’s your Comfort Zone. What does it feel like?”  
那是你的舒适区。感觉怎么样？”

This exercise doesn’t have to be used exclusively with something you hate. It can be something that makes you feel uncomfortable or gives you angst. The key is to identify what triggers you to move into your comfort zone.  
这个练习不必专门用于你讨厌的东西。它可能会让你感到不舒服或让你焦虑。关键是要确定是什么促使您进入舒适区。  
Your thoughts, emotions, and body sensations are valuable waypoints in this exploration. As we learned, change often brings us out of our comfort zone, so note what you do, especially when you’re experimenting with new routines or habits.  
您的想法、情绪和身体感觉是这次探索中很有价值的路标。正如我们所了解的，改变通常会让我们走出舒适区，因此请注意您所做的事情，尤其是当您尝试新的惯例或习惯时。

## How are you being complicit?  你怎么同谋了？

The vast majority of us say we want to change aspects of ourselves or situations that we don’t like, but we often fail to see how we’re unconsciously creating or perpetuating the situation.   
我们中的绝大多数人都说我们想改变自己的方面或我们不喜欢的情况，但我们常常看不到我们是如何无意识地创造或延续这种情况的。

In his book [_Reboot_](https://www.reboot.io/book/), CEO coach Jerry Colonna says, “We must take the radical step of inquiring into our selves, seeking to see ourselves with clarity, grace, compassion, and a fierce commitment to cut through our own bullshit.  
CEO 教练杰里·科隆纳 (Jerry Colonna) 在他的《重启》一书中说：“我们必须迈出彻底的一步，审视自己，以清晰、优雅、同情的态度审视自己，并坚定地致力于消除我们自己的胡说八道。  
We open ourselves up to ways we’ve been complicit in creating the conditions we say we don’t want.”   
我们敞开心扉，接受我们一直在同谋创造我们说我们不想要的条件的方式。”

To borrow Jerry’s signature question: “How are you complicit in creating the conditions you say you don’t want?” A different but related question I ask my clients is: what are all the ways you resist what you want?  
借用杰里的标志性问题：“你是如何串通创造你说你不想要的条件的？”我问我的客户的一个不同但相关的问题是：你抵制你想要的东西的所有方式是什么？

First, make a list of the recurring issues in your life that you would like to change. For example, I typically eat a bowl of ice cream most nights before bed even though I know it’s not healthy for me. I’ve wanted to change this for years, but haven’t.   
首先，列出您希望改变的生活中反复出现的问题。例如，我通常在大多数晚上睡前吃一碗冰淇淋，尽管我知道这对我不健康。多年来我一直想改变这一点，但一直没有。

Once you’ve identified the repeating issue, it’s time to identify all the ways in which you keep the issue going. In other words, how have I been complicit? Let me count the ways. I believe that a scoop of ice cream before bed isn’t that big of a deal.  
一旦确定了重复出现的问题，就该确定使问题继续存在的所有方式了。换句话说，我是如何同谋的？让我来计算一下。我相信睡前吃一勺冰淇淋没什么大不了的。  
I buy ice cream when I go to the store or order it for delivery. I say that my streak of days with no ice cream doesn’t really matter. I tell myself that I’ve been healthy all day and deserve a treat.  
我在去商店或订购外卖时购买冰淇淋。我说我连续几天不吃冰淇淋并不重要。我告诉自己，我一整天都很健康，应该得到款待。  
I perpetuate the craving when it arises even after I tell myself I don’t want sweets. I shame myself after I indulge. I’m unwilling to feel the feelings of frustration when I limit myself. And so on.   
即使在我告诉自己我不想要甜食之后，当它出现时，我仍然会继续渴望。放纵后自惭形秽。当我限制自己时，我不愿意感到沮丧。等等。

When we see how we’re being complicit, we can see how we’re resisting change and blocking what we say we want.    
当我们看到我们如何成为同谋时，我们就会看到我们如何抵制变革并阻止我们所说的我们想要的东西。

## Affirmative statements 肯定性陈述

[_The Artist's Way_](https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-25th-Anniversary/dp/0143129252) offers a potent exercise in which you write down a “[creative affirmation](http://www.inningsgate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ARTIST-WAY_Affirmations.pdf)” statement about what you want and how you want to see yourself. An example from the book is, “My creativity always leads me to truth and love.  
艺术家之道提供了一个强有力的练习，你可以在其中写下关于你想要什么以及你想如何看待自己的“创造性肯定”声明。书中的一个例子是，“我的创造力总是把我引向真理和爱。  
” Author Julia Cameron suggests writing the affirmation 10 times, and as you're writing you also jot down, in the margin, the "blurts" that come up—the things you say in your mind that are all about resisting the affirmation.   
” 作家朱莉娅·卡梅伦 (Julia Cameron) 建议将肯定句写 10 遍，并且在书写时，您还要在页边空白处记下出现的“脱口而出”——您在脑海中说出的所有与抵制肯定句有关的话。

The purpose of this exercise is to help you identify and challenge the limiting beliefs or negative self-talk that may be holding you back from fully embracing and expressing your creativity.  
本练习的目的是帮助您识别和挑战可能阻碍您充分拥抱和表达您的创造力的限制性信念或消极的自我对话。  
By consistently repeating the creative affirmation and acknowledging the blurts, you can begin to shift your mindset and adopt a more positive and empowering perspective on your creative abilities.  
通过不断重复创意肯定并承认脱口而出，您可以开始转变思维方式，并对您的创意能力采取更积极和更有力量的观点。  
This, in turn, can help you tap into your full creative potential and bring more meaning and fulfillment to your life and work.  
反过来，这可以帮助您充分发挥创造潜力，为您的生活和工作带来更多意义和成就感。

I have found this exercise to be shockingly effective for releasing the resistor and resisting narrative.  
我发现这个练习对于释放阻力和抵制叙述非常有效。  
By juxtaposing affirmations with blurts we’re able to give them distance so that they can be acknowledged and processed in a healthy way, rather than repressed and causing internal conflict.  
通过将肯定和脱口而出并置，我们能够让它们保持距离，以便它们能够以健康的方式得到承认和处理，而不是被压抑并引起内部冲突。  
This exercise has helped me to recognize and challenge negative thoughts and beliefs, and to replace them with positive and empowering ones.  
这个练习帮助我识别和挑战消极的想法和信念，并用积极和赋权的想法和信念取而代之。

## Face your fears 面对你的恐惧

Facing your fears is an effective way to uncover your resistor parts and get to know what might be holding you back.  
直面恐惧是揭开电阻器部件并了解可能阻碍您前进的因素的有效方法。  
By actively confronting the things that make us feel uncomfortable or uncertain, we can gain insight into our own thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors, and better understand what is driving our fear and resistance.  
通过积极面对让我们感到不舒服或不确定的事情，我们可以洞察自己的想法、信念和行为，并更好地理解是什么在驱使我们的恐惧和抗拒。

There are two powerful and illuminating questions from the book [_The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership_](https://www.amazon.com/15-Commitments-Conscious-Leadership-Sustainable-ebook/dp/B00R3MHWUE) that I come back to time and time again:   
我一次又一次地回顾《有意识的领导的 15 项承诺》一书中的两个有力而有启发性的问题：

-   If I changed, what am I afraid would happen?   
    如果我改变了，我害怕会发生什么？
-   What’s at risk if I stop being the way I’ve been or doing what I’ve been doing?   
    如果我不再像以前那样或不再做我一直在做的事情，会有什么风险？

The first question helps us identify the underlying fears and worries that may be preventing us from making a change. For example, before I devoted myself to writing, I was afraid that no one would read my work, I’d be criticized publicly, and I’d be wasting my time.  
第一个问题帮助我们确定可能阻止我们做出改变的潜在恐惧和担忧。比如，在我投入写作之前，我害怕没有人会看我的作品，我害怕被公开批评，我会浪费我的时间。  
The second question helps us consider the potential consequences of staying the same. For example, by not writing I’d have to live with the disappointment, heartbreak, and regret of not fully expressing myself.  
第二个问题帮助我们考虑保持不变的潜在后果。例如，如果不写作，我将不得不忍受没有充分表达自己的失望、心碎和遗憾。

By answering these questions honestly, we can gain a deeper understanding of what is driving our resistance and take steps to move beyond it.   
通过诚实地回答这些问题，我们可以更深入地了解是什么驱使我们抵抗并采取措施超越它。

## Honoring resistance and yourself 尊重抵抗和你自己

As you take action on your goals for 2023, I encourage you to consciously tune into all of your parts that resist change and spend time getting to know them. How are they trying to help you? What do they want? What are they afraid of? What are they protecting?    
当你为 2023 年的目标采取行动时，我鼓励你有意识地调整你所有抵制变化的部分，并花时间去了解它们。他们是如何帮助你的？他们想要什么？他们害怕什么？他们在保护什么？

When we identify, understand, and appreciate our resistor parts, we can access what Richard Schwartz calls the “Self.” This is who we are at our core—wise, centered, and authentic.  
当我们识别、理解和欣赏我们的电阻器部件时，我们可以访问 Richard Schwartz 所说的“自我”。这就是我们的核心——睿智、专注和真实。  
When a part is accepted and integrated, it can access more of the Self and all of its positive qualities—compassion, curiosity, calm, clarity, courage, connectedness, confidence, and creativity.  
当一个部分被接受和整合时，它可以获得更多的自我及其所有积极品质——同情、好奇、冷静、清晰、勇气、联系、自信和创造力。  
According to Schwartz, the goal of this work “is not to fuse all of these smaller personalities into a single big one. It is instead to restore leadership, balance and harmony, so that each part can take its preferred, valuable role.”  
根据 Schwartz 的说法，这项工作的目标“不是将所有这些小人物融合成一个大人物。相反，它是为了恢复领导力、平衡与和谐，以便每个部分都能发挥其偏好的、有价值的作用。”

When we’re able to access the Self, we can call specific parts forward and ask others to step back. We can resolve conflicts between parts. We can repurpose them for different roles. We can discover compassion for them.  
当我们能够访问自我时，我们可以调用特定部分向前并要求其他部分后退。我们可以解决零件之间的冲突。我们可以将它们重新用于不同的角色。我们可以发现对他们的同情。  
In other words, only by honoring all our parts are we able to lead ourselves. We have far more agency and freedom to choose how to move forward. And with a better, deeper relationship with ourselves, we’ll be more sure of the direction to take.  
换句话说，只有尊重我们所有的部分，我们才能领导自己。我们有更多的代理权和自由来选择如何前进。通过与自己建立更好、更深层次的关系，我们将更加确定前进的方向。

Befriending and honoring your resistor parts, you begin to let go of self-judgment and criticism, and approach current struggles and past experiences with more compassion and understanding.  
善待并尊重你的电阻部分，你开始放弃自我判断和批评，并以更多的同情和理解来处理当前的斗争和过去的经历。  
This shift in perspective can help you approach the change process with a more open and accepting mindset, which radically increases your chances of success.  
这种观点的转变可以帮助您以更加开放和接受的心态来处理变革过程，从而从根本上增加您成功的机会。  
You also begin to discover who you are on a deeper level, and learn to recognize old behavior patterns that might no longer serve you. This priceless knowledge helps you take a brave step forward with eyes wide open out of deep alignment and inner knowing.  
你也开始在更深层次上发现你是谁，并学会识别可能不再适合你的旧行为模式。这种无价的知识可以帮助你勇敢地向前迈出一步，从深刻的对齐和内在的了解中睁大眼睛。

Along the way you might discover, as I have, that what you initially wanted to change isn’t what you need or want after all. Knowing and appreciating our resistors leads to unexpected and profound changes, as we integrate parts of ourselves that were offline for decades.  
在此过程中，您可能会像我一样发现，您最初想要改变的毕竟不是您需要或想要的。了解和欣赏我们的电阻会带来意想不到的深刻变化，因为我们整合了自己几十年来离线的部分。  
When we do this, we actually become more of ourselves and, in doing so, may realize that we crave self-acceptance far more than self-improvement.  
当我们这样做时，我们实际上变得更加自我，并且在这样做的过程中，可能会意识到我们更渴望自我接纳而不是自我提升。
