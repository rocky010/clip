Assumed Audience

People who write and/or are interested in designing writing tools. Also people who are familiar with

and curious about their potential to improve the writing process

写作和/或对设计写作工具感兴趣的人。还有熟悉语言模型并对它们改进写作过程的潜力感到好奇的人

Reverse outlining is one of my go-to writing tactics when I'm stuck on a piece of writing. It's the opposite of traditional outlining. Rather than outlining the shape of your piece first, organising the structure, and then filling in all the details, you do it backwards.

当我坚持写一篇文章时，反向概述是我的写作策略之一。这与传统的大纲相反。与其先勾勒出作品的轮廓，组织结构，然后填充所有细节，不如倒着做。

You start with a long, rambling, unorganised slew of text first: you write the messy and chaotic first draft without worrying too much about structure. _Then_ you go through the piece and for every paragraph, write a single sentence that summarises it.

你首先从一大堆杂乱无章的文本开始：你写下了杂乱无章的初稿，而不太担心结构。然后你浏览这篇文章并为每一段写一个总结它的句子。

![Illustration of starting with a draft and using it to create an outline](outline-sketch.jpg)

You then put your one-sentence summaries on small, moveable objects like post-it notes or cards, and reorganise them into a sensible flow.

然后你把你的一句话总结放在小的、可移动的物体上，比如便利贴或卡片，并将它们重新组织成一个合理的流程。

Once you have a decent structure to work within, you go back to your crappy first draft, cut and paste salvageable bits of it into the new structure, and smooth out all the rough transitions.

一旦你有一个合适的结构可以在其中工作，你就会回到你糟糕的初稿，将其中可挽救的部分剪切并粘贴到新结构中，并平滑所有粗糙的过渡。

This process helps you do a few important things:  
这个过程可以帮助你做一些重要的事情：  

-   Easily spot logical flaws or holes in your argument  
    轻松发现论点中的逻辑缺陷或漏洞  
    
-   Add transitional bridges between paragraphs that make large leaps or change topics unexpectedly  
    在段落之间添加过渡桥梁，以实现大幅跳跃或意外改变主题  
    
-   Combine paragraphs that are trying to say the same thing  
    合并试图表达相同内容的段落  
    
-   Remove paragraphs you don't need or are tangential to the argument  
    删除不需要或与论点无关的段落  
    
-   Break up paragraphs that are trying to say too many things in one breath  
    打破试图一口气说太多事情的段落  
    
-   Arrange your points into a narrative arc that will make sense to the reader  
    将您的观点安排成对读者有意义的叙述弧线

Reverse outlining is popular enough that we already have some specialised tools to help with it. I personally do it with digital whiteboarding tools like

or that give you an infinite canvas to arrange arguments on.

反向轮廓非常流行，我们已经有一些专门的工具来帮助它。我个人是使用 Miro 或 Mural 等数字白板工具来完成的，它们为您提供了一个无限大的画布来安排论点。

Here's one of my Miro reverse outlines where I'm figuring out the structure of one of my longer essays on

这是我的一篇 Miro 反向大纲，我正在其中弄清楚我的一篇关于作为文化实践的思想工具的较长文章的结构

![One of my reverse outlines on a Miro whiteboard](miro.png)

Miro and Mural work well enough, but they're not specifically designed to help with this task.  
Miro 和 Mural 工作得很好，但它们并不是专门为帮助完成这项任务而设计的。  

is a much better example of writing tool that enables reverse outlining. It's designed for huge, heady projects like novels, non-fiction books, or screenplays where you have to wrangle lots of material. It's stuffed full of features but two in particular help with reverse outlining: synopsis sentences and corkboards.

Scrivener 是支持反向勾画的书写工具的一个更好的例子。它专为大型、令人兴奋的项目而设计，例如小说、非小说类书籍或剧本，您必须在这些项目中处理大量材料。它充满了功能，但有两个特别有助于反向概述：概要句子和软木板。

For every chunk of text you can write a "synopsis" that summarises what it's about. These are visible in the inspector sidebar and on the "corkboard" – the other key feature.

对于每一段文本，你都可以写一个“概要”来总结它的内容。这些在检查器侧边栏和“软木板”（另一个关键功能）中可见。

The corkboard shows you a set of cards with the title and synopsis visible. Each of these cards represents a longer chunk of text that you can view if you click inside them. You can drag and drop these into different arrangements.

公告板向您展示了一组卡片，其中的标题和概要可见。这些卡片中的每一张都代表一段较长的文本，如果您在其中单击，则可以查看这些文本。您可以将它们拖放到不同的排列中。

As you drag the cards into a different arrangement, the original, longer text chunks are also rearranged – there's a 1:1 mapping between them. This saves you from cutting and pasting the piece into its new structure after you've sorted your outline. There's a more detailed walkthrough of how Scrivener's synopses and corkboard work in

.

当您将卡片拖入不同的排列时，原始的、较长的文本块也会重新排列——它们之间存在 1:1 的映射。这样可以避免在对大纲进行排序后将片段剪切并粘贴到新结构中。在此视频中更详细地介绍了 Scrivener 的提要和公告板的工作原理。

This is already a big improvement over using whiteboarding software that's completely disconnected from notes and drafts stored elsewhere. We can still do better though.

与使用完全脱离其他地方存储的笔记和草稿的白板软件相比，这已经是一个很大的改进。不过，我们仍然可以做得更好。

[## Bring in the Language Models 引入语言模型](https://maggieappleton.com/reverse-outline#bring-in-the-language-models)

Summarising existing text turns out to be something large language models are very good at. We can feed them long chunks of text and get back shorter, simpler summaries. This makes them promising tools for reverse outlining: we could have a model summarise each paragraph for us.

总结现有文本被证明是大型语言模型非常擅长的事情。我们可以向他们提供大段文本，然后返回更短、更简单的摘要。这使它们成为很有前途的反向概述工具：我们可以让一个模型为我们总结每个段落。

A few people have already started exploring this idea.  
一些人已经开始探索这个想法。  

A group of researchers at the University of Bayreuth, Germany built a prototype specifically designed for reverse outlining with language models. In

**: Supporting Writers with Continuous Automatic Text Summaries** (2022) they describe the interface and their results after testing it with a small group of students and academics

德国拜罗伊特大学的一组研究人员构建了一个原型，专门设计用于使用语言模型进行反向概述。在 Beyond Text Generation: Supporting Writers with Continuous Automatic Text Summaries (2022) 中，他们描述了界面及其在与一小群学生和学者进行测试后的结果

Here's an annotated screenshot of the main interface:  
这是主界面的带注释的屏幕截图：  

![An annotated interface of the prototype in the 'beyond text' paper](beyondtext.jpg)

It's a split-view text editor with summary cards linked to each paragraph. The summaries themselves are generated by a language model – in this case

model. They also tried a variation that pulls out the most important sentence directly from the text.

它是一个拆分视图文本编辑器，带有链接到每个段落的摘要卡。摘要本身由语言模型生成——在本例中为 Google 的 T5 模型。他们还尝试了一种变体，直接从文本中提取最重要的句子。

They baked an impressive amount of functionality into this. Users could obviously drag and drop to rearrange paragraphs. But they could also add new paragraphs, delete them, merge them, and split them. These kind of text interactions are essential for editing, but I imagine they're non-trivial to build.

他们在其中融入了大量功能。用户显然可以通过拖放来重新排列段落。但他们也可以添加新段落、删除段落、合并段落和拆分段落。这些类型的文本交互对于编辑来说是必不可少的，但我认为构建它们并非易事。

Last year,

shared a on Twitter that are remarkably similar in spirit. You have text and generated summaries shown side-by-side, and you can drag and drop to rearrange the content:

去年，Amelia Wattenberger 在 Twitter 上分享了一系列在精神上非常相似的原型视频。您可以并排显示文本和生成的摘要，并且可以拖放以重新排列内容：

Both of these prototypes feel full of promise. But for the moment, neither exist in any public format. I can't point you to a link or Github repo to try them out yourself.

这两个原型都充满希望。但就目前而言，两者都不存在于任何公共格式中。我无法为您指出链接或 Github 存储库以供您亲自试用。

I also haven't seen this feature in any of the existing “AI writing tools” flooding the market.  
我也没有在任何充斥市场的现有“AI 写作工具”中看到此功能。  

I wish I could end this note with a link to my _own_ prototype that we could all play around with. But I am a _very_ mediocre developer, and text editors are notoriously complex beasts. I know better than to dive down that rabbit hole. But I'm hoping someone else doesn't...

我希望我能以指向我自己的原型的链接结束这篇笔记，我们都可以使用它。但我是一个非常平庸的开发人员，而文本编辑器是出了名的复杂野兽。我知道最好不要潜入那个兔子洞。但我希望别人不要...
