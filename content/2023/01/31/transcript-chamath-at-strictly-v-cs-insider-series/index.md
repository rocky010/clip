( (_This is the transcript from last night’s chat at [Connie’s](https://www.twitter.com/cookie) **StrictlyVC Insider Series** with Chamath from Social+Capital. I wasn’t on Twitter today but checked in the afternoon and saw that tons of people were talking about it. It must have [struck a chord](http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/17/chamath-palihapitaya-on-insane-burn-rates-ipos-and-raising-a-new-real-estate-fund/), so I talked to Connie and got someone to transcribe the Periscope. It is definitely worth a read.  
这是昨晚在 Connie 的 StrictlyVC Insider 系列中与 Social+Capital 的 Chamath 的谈话记录。我今天没有上 Twitter，但下午查看了一下，发现有很多人在谈论它。它一定引起了共鸣，所以我和康妮谈了谈，找人转录潜望镜。绝对值得一读。  
Chamath not only candidly says what most others would be too nervous to say publicly, he does so in a way that demonstrates he is a truly big thinker and pushing forward the model and conception of what a technology investor can and should be.  
Chamath 不仅坦率地说出大多数其他人会因为太紧张而不敢公开说的话，而且他这样做的方式表明他是一个真正的大思想家，并推动了技术投资者可以和应该成为的模式和概念。_) )

**@SEMIL Intro**: Thanks everyone for coming. Connie organizes these events, they’re something I really look forward to, and in particular this one. A lot of you here mentioned me on email that you were looking forward to this event with [Chamath](https://www.twitter.com/chamath), you probably follow him on Twitter, listen to what he says, maybe you don’t agree with everything, but what I find really unique about Chamath, is that when he says something you know he’s thought about it and you know he means what he says.  
@SEMIL简介：感谢大家的到来。康妮组织了这些活动，这是我非常期待的事情，尤其是这次。你们中的很多人在电子邮件中提到我，你们期待与 Chamath 的这次活动，你们可能在 Twitter 上关注他，听听他说的话，也许你不同意所有的事情，但我发现 Chamath 的真正独特之处，是当他说某事时，您知道他已经考虑过了，并且您知道他是认真的。  
To be fair to Chamath I emailed him twice before the event and I said, “what do you want to talk, plug, you tell me.. and he says just adlib, make it interesting. So, we’re going to rely on Chamath to make it interesting.  
公平地说，我在活动开始前给他发了两次电子邮件，我说，“你想谈什么，塞，你告诉我.. 他说只是即兴表演，让它变得有趣。所以，我们要依靠 Chamath 让它变得有趣。

**Which Becomes A Trillion-Dollar Company First: Facebook or Uber?  
哪个先成为价值万亿美元的公司：Facebook 还是 Uber？**

**@CHAMATH**: Facebook. And it really comes down to a very simple thing, which is, the principle of N of 1 vs. 1 of N.  
**@CHAMATH** ：脸书。这真的归结为一件非常简单的事情，即 N of 1 vs. 1 of N 的原则。  
This is something I think about a lot, which is, when you look at a company, they become these foundational layers in society, to me what’s interesting is they always start where they’re a set of many, they’re 1 of N companies, and somewhere along the way what happens is a bunch of them fall off.  
这是我经常思考的事情，也就是说，当你看一家公司时，他们成为社会的这些基础层，对我来说有趣的是，他们总是从许多人的集合开始，他们是 N 中的一个公司，一路上的某个地方发生的事情是他们中的很多人倒下了。  
There’s these periods of real, either misunderstanding, or discontent, or frustration, and then they develop something discontinuous.  
有这些真实的时期，要么是误解，要么是不满，要么是沮丧，然后他们发展出一些不连续的东西。  
When you put those things together, that allows a company to separate themselves from the pack, and eventually, everything falls away, and they’re an N of 1 company.  
当你把这些东西放在一起时，这会让一家公司脱颖而出，最终，一切都消失了，他们是一家 N of 1 公司。  
Then they scale and are effectively a monopoly.  
然后他们扩大规模，实际上是垄断企业。

If you think of companies that multi-generationally have done that well, Microsoft did that, I think Google did that, Apple will become a trillion dollar company, even though they didn’t start off as an N of 1 path, and Facebook has done that.  
如果你想到几代人都做得很好的公司，_微软_做到了，我认为谷歌做到了，苹果将成为一家价值万亿美元的公司，即使他们不是从 N of 1 的道路开始的，而 Facebook 已经做到了。

But when you compare that to Uber, it’s interesting, people want to value the company as if it’s an N of 1, but it’s fundamentally a 1 of N. And I think that doesn’t..  
但是当你将它与 Uber 进行比较时，这很有趣，人们希望对公司进行估值，就好像它是 1 的 N，但它基本上是 N 的 1。我认为事实并非如此......  
it basically limits the rate at which it can grow, and the violent market effects it can have, and I think what you see is probably business features sprawl in order to generate revenue to justify valuation.  
它基本上限制了它的增长速度，以及它可能产生的剧烈市场影响，我认为你看到的可能是业务功能的扩张，目的是为了产生收入来证明估值的合理性。

So you know, at Facebook, for five years, all we talked about was user growth. Like there’s only one thing that matters: user growth, user growth, user growth. Why?  
所以你知道，在 Facebook，五年来，我们谈论的只是用户增长。就像只有一件事很重要：用户增长，用户增长，用户增长。为什么？  
Because at a certain point, it basically becomes this canonical definitional service in the world, by language which they will not use, but is like, you are the de facto standard, and that’s how you become worth a trillion dollars, because you have market effects, pricing effects, the ability to attract talent, that is just completely unique and differentiated.  
因为在某个时候，它基本上成为世界上这种规范的定义服务，通过他们不会使用的语言，但就像，你是事实上的标准，这就是你如何变得价值一万亿美元，因为你有市场效应、定价效应、吸引人才的能力，那是完全独特和差异化的。

But if you’re an N of 1 company, you’re competing with different folks, and that’s the problem with Uber is that it has to compete with a bunch of folks here, both private and public, capitalized and not.  
但如果你是一家 N of 1 公司，你就在与不同的人竞争，而优步的问题在于它必须与这里的一群人竞争，无论是私人的还是公共的，资本化的还是非资本化的。  
In china it has a completely different set of competitors, in India, it has a completely different set of competitors, each of them are funded to billions and billions of dollars, so what happens with market dynamics, is basically driving things to commodification, driving things to basically price discovery where you don’t have pricing power, you don’t have the effects that make you monopolistic, and the problem is markets will not deny you that at massive multiples.  
在中国，它有一组完全不同的竞争对手，在印度，它有一组完全不同的竞争对手，他们每个人都有数十亿美元的资金，所以市场动态发生的事情，基本上是在推动商品化，推动在你没有定价权的地方基本上是价格发现，你没有使你垄断的影响，问题是市场不会以巨大的倍数拒绝你。

The way that they value things that are fundamentally unique and not easily recreatable.. So, that turn of capital, those 3 or 4 multiples of P/E that makes something a 40 X vs.  
他们对那些从根本上来说是独一无二的、不容易被重新创造的事物进行估值的方式。所以，资本的转变，那些 3 或 4 倍的市盈率，使某事物的市盈率达到了 40 倍，而不是 40 倍。  
a 12 X is a difference between grossing $150B and a trillion dollars, and it’s beyond a shadow of a doubt that Facebook will be a trillion dollar company, it’s just you’re talking about the delta: T which is probably sub-15 years. In my opinion. Uber’s not there. Great company.  
12 X 是总收入 $150B 和一万亿美元之间的差异，毫无疑问，Facebook 将成为一家价值万亿美元的公司，只是你在谈论三角洲：T 可能不到 15 年.在我看来。优步不在那里。伟大的公司。  
But not anywhere near the path of being an N of 1 company.  
但距离成为 1 家公司的 N 之路还差得很远。

**Semil**: One follow up on that, do you see any similarities from your time at Facebook with Facebook platform and connect, and how Uber may supercharge their platform.  
Semil：跟进一下，你是否看到你在 Facebook 的时间与 Facebook 平台和连接有什么相似之处，以及优步如何增强他们的平台。

**Chamath**: Neither of them are platforms. They’re both kind of like these comical endeavors that do you as an Nth priority. I was in charge of Facebook platform. We trumpeted it out like it was some hot shit big deal.  
Chamath：它们都不是平台。他们都有点像这些滑稽的努力，把你当作第 N 优先考虑的事情。我负责 Facebook 平台。我们大肆宣扬它，就像这是一件大事一样。  
And I remember when we raised money from Bill Gates, 3 or 4 months after.. like our funding history was $5M, $83 M, $500M, and then $15B.  
我记得我们从比尔·盖茨那里筹集资金时，3 或 4 个月后……我们的融资历史是 500 万美元、8300 万美元、5 亿美元，然后是 1500 万美元。  
When that 15B happened around literally a few months after Facebook platform and Gates said something along the lines of, “That’s a crock of shit. This isn’t a platform.  
当 15B 发生在 Facebook 平台几个月后，盖茨说了一些类似的话，“那是一堆狗屎。这不是一个平台。  
A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it, exceeds the value of the company that creates it. Then it’s a platform.”  
平台是指使用它的每个人的经济价值超过创建它的公司的价值。那么它就是一个平台。”

If you apply that simple methodology to any company that says they’re a platform, there are only 3 platforms in the world! You know? Windows is a quasi-platform, decaying, but still, iOS is platform, and Android is platform, but that’s easy because the denominator is 0.  
如果您将这种简单的方法应用于任何自称是平台的公司，那么世界上只有 3 个平台！你懂？ Windows 是一个准平台，正在衰落，但仍然如此，iOS 是平台，Android 是平台，但这很容易，因为分母是 0。  
So, I think, that these aren’t “platforms”, these are APIs, these are developer tools, which is good, and it’s a bridge to something, but it’s not a platform, so let’s stop calling it a platform, let’s call it what it is, which is a bunch of endpoints.  
所以，我认为，这些不是“平台”，这些是 API，这些是开发人员工具，这很好，它是通往某些东西的桥梁，但它不是平台，所以让我们停止称它为平台，让我们称之为它是什么，它是一堆端点。

**Discuss The State Of Professional Sports In The Bay Area  
探讨湾区职业体育现状**

**Chamath**: I think the Warriors are an example of basically applying traditional management to sports, which is like a really unique kind of thing, which hasn’t been done before. Take a step back.. we teach our kids basically, don’t listen to anybody.  
查马斯：我认为勇士队是基本上将传统管理应用于体育运动的一个例子，这是一种非常独特的事情，以前从未有人做过。退后一步.. 我们基本上是在教我们的孩子，不要听任何人的。  
We just don’t want them to be programmed.. (_this is when Chamath’s son, who was sitting in the front row, just left the talk and walked out_), so if he he can take an Uber home I guess.  
我们只是不希望他们被编程..（这是坐在前排的 Chamath 的儿子刚刚离开谈话并走出去的时候），所以我想如果他能把优步带回家。

I think the Giants are pretty well run, I think there’s a really interesting opportunity to do something around the Raiders. I’ll leave it at that.  
我认为巨人队经营得很好，我认为有一个非常有趣的机会可以围绕突袭者队做点什么。我会留在那里。

**Assessing The Health Of The SF Bay Area Tech Startup Ecosystem  
评估旧金山湾区科技创业生态系统的健康状况**

**Chamath**: These are all really interconnected, but if you think about it, there’s way too much money, in the system, ultimately still chasing few really great companies.  
Chamath：这些都是相互关联的，但如果你仔细想想，系统中有太多的钱，最终仍然追逐少数真正伟大的公司。  
The problem with that is that you have a bunch of imposter companies that get funded for a lot longer than traditional cycles.  
这样做的问题是，你有一堆冒名顶替的公司，它们获得资金的时间比传统周期长得多。

So if you had 1/10 the capital, the mortality rates would be higher, faster, the curves are sharp, and instead of what happens is the decay is longer, and in the long decay, what essentially happens is that you are feeding capital to companies that should really not exist anymore, and those companies then use that capital to take up space.  
因此，如果你有 1/10 的资本，死亡率会更高、更快，曲线会更陡峭，而不是发生的是衰减更长的时间，而在长期衰减中，本质上发生的是你在喂养资本给那些真的不应该存在的公司，然后这些公司用这笔资金占用空间。  
They use that capital to hire other employees, and all these other people spend a lot more time wasting their time.  
他们用这笔资金雇用其他员工，而所有这些其他人花费更多的时间来浪费他们的时间。  
And that’s problematic, and if you don’t get that churn, then the few that have the ability to really get to escape velocity, are forced to figure out for themselves, how to get that sooner?  
这是有问题的，如果你没有得到那种流失，那么少数有能力真正达到逃逸速度的人，将被迫自己弄清楚，如何更快地做到这一点？

So what do they do?  那么他们做什么呢？  
They start to pay people more, they start to spend more on these things that think will attract all these people, and that has this negative byproduct, which is everything goes up, the cost of everything starts to rise, and you have this really vicious cycle where at some point then that N + first young engineer, can’t afford to come here in the first place, because he can’t even afford a 1 bedroom out of  5 bedrooms because it’s $2000, and all of a sudden a first year engineer is making $170K, and it’s like this violent vicious cycle that helps nobody.  
他们开始付更多的钱给人们，他们开始在这些认为会吸引所有这些人的东西上花更多的钱，这就产生了负面的副产品，那就是一切都在上涨，一切的成本都开始上升，这真的很恶性循环，然后那个 N + 第一个年轻工程师，首先负担不起来这里，因为他甚至买不起 5 个卧室中的 1 个卧室，因为它是 2000 美元，突然间第一个一年的工程师赚了 17 万美元，这就像这种对任何人都没有帮助的暴力恶性循环。

**Semil**: So a lot of people think the solution to that is just more housing, more affordable housing, sounds like what you’re saying, even if they do that, it still wouldn’t stop the core problem.  
塞米尔：所以很多人认为解决这个问题的办法就是增加住房，提供更多负担得起的住房，听起来就像你说的那样，即使他们这样做了，也仍然无法解决核心问题。

**Chamath**: I mean you need to do a couple of things. If we’re really going to bet on SF, and if we’re really going to bet on startups. In Silicon Valley, you have to do a bunch of stuff privately and you have to do a bunch of stuff publically.  
Chamath：我的意思是你需要做几件事。如果我们真的要押注于 SF，如果我们真的要押注于初创公司。在硅谷，你必须私下做很多事情，你必须公开做很多事情。

So at the public level, you have to invest in what the city is doing, and I think you could debate on some level, how much work the city should be doing around transportation, around housing, you have to basically get rid of the nimbyism and you have to decide to build up.  
所以在公共层面，你必须投资于城市正在做的事情，我认为你可以在某种程度上讨论，城市应该在交通、住房方面做多少工作，你必须基本上摆脱邻避主义你必须决定建立起来。  
You need to quadruple the amount of housing, quintuple amount of housing. You need to tell every young engineer from University of Michigan that they can afford to live here on $80K a year.  
你需要四倍的住房数量，五倍的住房数量。你需要告诉密歇根大学的每一位年轻工程师，他们有能力以每年 8 万美元的价格住在这里。  
All the other ancillary surfaces you need to be able to do that, as an example, we look at our startups and we’re like, the minute that they start to spend 15% of their burn, money that we give them, good money, on rent?? Huge red flag goes up.  
你需要的所有其他辅助表面才能做到这一点，例如，我们看看我们的初创公司，我们就像，当他们开始花费 15% 的燃烧时，我们给他们的钱，好钱, 出租??巨大的红旗升起。  
It’s like, there’s all of these other simple signals, when you, on a per headcount basis, are spending so much, and we start to look at like, the productivity of the technical team, and it’s like good but not great and they’re spending the same amount of money as a team in Redwood city, we start to ask ourselves, are you so convinced that success is going to happen in this city at 1.5X of cost.  
就像，还有所有这些其他简单的信号，当你在每个人的基础上花费这么多时，我们开始关注技术团队的生产力，这很好但不是很好而且他们'当我们在红木市花费与团队相同的资金时，我们开始问自己，您是否坚信以 1.5 倍的成本在这个城市会取得成功。

For every dollar that someone in Redwood City or Mountain View is raising, you have to raise 1.5 times or 2 times that. Just to get to the same point in time. So you’re cutting you half-life in half. To prove what??  
对于红木城或山景城的某个人筹集的每一美元，您必须筹集 1.5 倍或 2 倍的资金。只是为了到达相同的时间点。所以你把你的半条命减半了。证明什么？？  
That you can take an Uber from some shitty bar to another shitty bar? I don’t understand. These are like the things that I start to think about, these constraints that need to get fixed.  
你可以从一些糟糕的酒吧乘坐优步到另一个糟糕的酒吧？我不明白。这些就像我开始考虑的事情，这些限制需要得到解决。

So, at the public level, you need to have an approach that kind of creates the attractive incentives, for people to come and be able to survive on a living wage.  
所以，在公共层面，你需要有一种方法来创造有吸引力的激励措施，让人们来这里并能够靠生活工资生存。  
Then at a private level we need to hold our companies to a higher standards where they’re not just burning money on useless stuff that is window dressing. That’s fundamentally getting in the way of building something useful.  
然后在私人层面，我们需要让我们的公司达到更高的标准，让他们不只是在无用的东西上烧钱，这些东西是橱窗装饰。这从根本上阻碍了构建有用的东西。

**Semil**: When you mentioned the rate of churn, is slower, as that churn slows, what’s the effect of that? Is it clogging up resources? Are people sticking in at roles where companies are going nowhere..  
Semil：当你提到流失率时，它变慢了，因为流失变慢了，那有什么影响？会不会占用资源？人们是否坚持担任公司无处可去的角色……

**Chamath**: I actually think it’s more insidious than that, it’s like telling somebody..  
Chamath：我实际上认为它比那更阴险，就像告诉某人......  
startups are this really delicate compact that an employer has with a bunch of employees, these employees are a highly productive, extremely well intentioned, people who want to do something really productive, they’re willing to make huge sacrifices, in order to do something that changes the world, that to use a slightly overused phrase.  
创业公司是雇主与一群员工签订的非常微妙的契约，这些员工生产力高，用心良苦，他们想做一些真正有生产力的事情，他们愿意做出巨大的牺牲，为了做某事这改变了世界，用一个稍微被过度使用的短语来说。

But when you suck them in, and now you don’t pay off that contract, yet they’ve been working 20 hrs/day for months and months, what are you doing to that person’s psyche/ what you’re really doing is you betray that compact that they made with you.  
但是当你把他们吸进去，现在你没有还清合同，但他们已经连续几个月每天工作 20 小时，你对那个人的心灵做了什么/你真正在做的是你自己背叛他们与你订立的契约。  
Now it’s fine to fail, and in fact it’s great to fail, but if you fail because you didn’t have the courage to move to Oakland, and instead you burn 30% of your cash on Kind bars in the office and exposed brick walls? You’re a fucking moron. Do you know what I’m saying?  
现在失败很好，事实上失败很棒，但如果你失败是因为你没有勇气搬到奥克兰，而是你在办公室的 Kind 酒吧和裸露的砖墙上烧掉了 30% 的现金？你他妈的是个白痴。你知道我在说什么吗？

**On Companies Staying Private Versus Going Public  
关于公司保持私有与上市**

**Chamath**: I don’t understand why public is a bad thing. I think it’s the most rationalizing thing in the word. Because you cannot hide behind bravado and nonsense.  
Chamath：我不明白为什么公开是一件坏事。我认为这是这个词中最合理化的东西。因为你不能躲在虚张声势和废话后面。  
You are forced to show that you have articulated a strategy, and a gameplan, and a set of metrics, and narrative, and you have to explain that to people who may not necessarily care emotionally. That’s not a bad thing. That is like an act of discipline.  
你被迫表明你已经阐明了一个战略、一个游戏计划、一组指标和叙述，你必须向那些不一定在情感上关心的人解释这一点。这不是坏事。这就像一种纪律行为。  
So as an example, you look at a company like Amazon, they barely generated a dollar of profit, but Bezos has created a envelop of trust in the public markets, which are extremely fickle, which are extremely judgmental, we claim them to be extremely short-sighted.  
因此，举个例子，你看看像亚马逊这样的公司，他们几乎没有产生一美元的利润，但贝索斯在公共市场上创造了一个信任圈，这个市场非常善变，非常有判断力，我们声称他们非常目光短浅。  
Yet they’ve taken a 20-year multi-decade bet on this guy.  
然而，他们已经在这个人身上下了 20 多年的赌注。

So I think that line of reasoning is just wad. It’s an excuse that prevents you from being held accountable in ways that make you fundamentally uncomfortable, cause you’re afraid of what it means to build a real business. Build a real business. Be around for decades.  
所以我认为这种推理只是一团糟。这是一个借口，阻止你以让你从根本上感到不舒服的方式被追究责任，因为你害怕建立一个真正的企业意味着什么。建立一个真正的企业。存在数十年。  
You have a compact with employees, financial source of capital, and you have  an opportunity to have market leverage, if you’re good, give you a currency that you can use, so that you can get to N of 1. So why wouldn’t you do it?!  
你和员工有契约，有资金来源，你有机会有市场杠杆，如果你做得好，给你一个你可以使用的货币，这样你就可以达到 N of 1。那为什么不你做吗？！

The people that don’t do it, is the people that can’t do it. And the people that can’t do it, will, say all this stuff about waiting, waiting, cause the markets don’t understand.. is just a false trade off, it’s just an immature understanding of your own business.  
不做的人，就是做不到的人。而那些做不到的人，会说所有这些关于等待，等待，导致市场不理解的东西。这只是一种错误的权衡，这只是对你自己的业务的不成熟理解。  
And what it tells me, is that you don’t know your business. Jeff Bezos knows his business. Indisputable. He never grew it 100%. But he grew it 20% per year for 15 straight years. Bang, bang, bang, etc… That guy knows his business.  
它告诉我的是，你不了解你的业务。杰夫贝索斯了解他的业务。无可争辩。他从来没有100%地种植过它。但他连续 15 年每年增长 20%。砰，砰，砰，等等……那家伙知道他的生意。

**Trump As A Media Sensation 特朗普作为媒体轰动**

**Chamath**: I think he’s, whether you agree with him or not, he is his authentic self. I think that people are starved for average, approachable people, that are themselves.  
查马斯：我认为他是，不管你是否同意他的看法，他都是真实的自己。我认为人们渴望平庸的、平易近人的人，也就是他们自己。  
And some of us like it because it’s like watching a train wreck, other people like it because it represents their beliefs and values, it doesn’t matter if there’s authenticity there, and I think the problem is, if you’re part of a system and your entire life has been created by getting these small signals that system matters, you’ll always live by the rules of the system and eventually you become part of the system, you become co-opted, you know you’re not yourself anymore.  
我们中的一些人喜欢它，因为它就像在看火车失事，其他人喜欢它，因为它代表了他们的信仰和价值观，是否真实并不重要，我认为问题在于，如果你是一个系统和你的整个生活都是通过获得系统重要的这些小信号来创造的，你将始终按照系统的规则生活，最终你成为系统的一部分，你成为被选中的人，你知道你不是你自己了。  
That’s basically all politicians.  
这基本上是所有的政客。

Then every now and then you have this window into the humanity of a person, and it’s really intoxicating.  
然后，您时不时地通过这个窗口了解一个人的人性，这真是令人陶醉。  
All the people that for once in their life were like, Biden’s the best were simply because of a handful of questions that he answered on Colbert, where he was actually honest and authentic, so I just think authenticity is just the thing that’s truly missing, and I think that’s what people are attracted to.  
所有在他们生命中曾经有过一次的人都认为，拜登是最好的，这仅仅是因为他在科尔伯特上回答了一些问题，他实际上是诚实和真实的，所以我只是认为真实性才是真正缺少的东西，我认为这就是人们被吸引的地方。

**Audience Q1: Getting Sucked Into A Bigger Money Round Frenzy  
观众 Q1：陷入更大的资金轮狂潮**

**Chamath**: We were doing some work, and I think the data point that saw was that the largest series A of a very successful public company, if you go back and look at every company that’s ever gone public, and you look at the largest market caps all the way to the smallest, and you look at your series A, and how much they raised, the largest was Google. $25M raise.  
Chamath：我们正在做一些工作，我认为看到的数据点是一家非常成功的上市公司最大的 A 轮融资，如果你回头看看每家上市的公司，然后看看最大的市场一直到最小，你看看你的 A 系列，他们筹集了多少资金，最大的是谷歌。筹集 2500 万美元。  
So this idea that you need all this money is a false trade off. Ben just talked about Fitbit.  
所以你需要所有这些钱的想法是错误的权衡。 Ben 刚刚谈到了 Fitbit。  
It’s an amazing example of what a company can do on what people thought was probably, “Oh my god, they must of raised billions of dollars” and it turns out that they didn’t, they were just really good at what they did.  
这是一个令人惊叹的例子，说明一家公司可以根据人们的想法做些什么，“天哪，他们一定筹集了数十亿美元”，但事实证明他们没有，他们只是非常擅长他们所做的事情。  
So, again, I think that if you looked at a company and how they’re spending money today, we probably would be shocked, relative to historic levels, how much of it’s going into Kind bars and exposed brick and how much is going to the per individual basis, which is great for that person, but again it’s emblematic if that person then takes all that money that they’re making..  
所以，我再次认为，如果你看看一家公司，看看他们今天是如何花钱的，相对于历史水平，我们可能会感到震惊，其中有多少用于 Kind bars 和裸露的砖头，有多少将用于每个人的基础，这对那个人来说很好，但如果那个人然后拿走了他们赚的所有钱，这又是一个象征。

Like when I came here, my first job, I made $55K. In 2000. I was a product manager. How do you go from $55K to $175K in fifteen years?  
就像我来到这里时，我的第一份工作，我赚了 55,000 美元。 2000年，我是一名_产品经理_。您如何在 15 年内从 5.5 万美元涨到 17.5 万美元？  
So it’s great, but if I were taking that $175K and still having less than that $55K of net effective income, because 2/3 of that goes to rent, and another 1/3 goes to transportation, am I really that better off? I have a higher W2, but I don’t feel richer.  
所以这很好，但是如果我拿了 175,000 美元，但净有效收入仍然少于 55,000 美元，因为其中 2/3 用于租金，另外 1/3 用于交通，我真的过得更好吗？我有更高的 W2，但我并不觉得更富有。

So who’s making the money? Cushman & Wakefield, who owns this building makes the money? That makes no sense to me. So the way we react to this is, we’re like, we try to see who’s willing to do the hard work of business building, and who’s acting. And there are very simple ways.  
那么谁在赚钱呢？ Cushman & Wakefield，谁拥有这栋楼赚钱？这对我来说毫无意义。所以我们对此的反应是，我们想看看谁愿意为业务建设做艰苦的工作，谁在行动。并且有非常简单的方法。  
We just ask, let me see how you’re spending your cash. The actors just jump off the page.  
我们只是问，让我看看你是如何花钱的。演员只是跳下页面。  
The company builders are just cheap, they’re just grimy, and just, shitty office space, and they’ve got to keep it under 8 or 9% of their total burn, and they find people who really really believe in the thing they’re making, and they decide to just live in Oakland and pay for Lyft, and it’s still cheaper..  
公司建设者只是便宜，他们只是肮脏，只是，肮脏的办公空间，他们必须将其控制在总燃烧量的 8% 或 9% 以下，他们找到真正相信他们的东西的人正在赚钱，他们决定只住在奥克兰并支付 Lyft 的费用，而且它仍然更便宜..  
They do all kinds of creative things that deserve capital so they can build. So it forces us to ask those questions, “How are you really company building?” And that’s how we get the truth on who’s going to stand the test of time.  
他们做各种值得投资的创造性的事情，这样他们就可以建设。所以它迫使我们问这些问题，“你真的是如何建立公司的？”这就是我们如何了解谁将经得起时间考验的真相。

**Audience Q2: Cite Examples Of Public And Private Initiatives The Region Needs  
听众 Q2：列举该地区需要的公共和私人倡议的例子**

**Chamath**: I can answer this question in the context of Social Capital. So we made a really big transition in the last month, where we decided we’re going to build an organization that looks different than a venture firm.  
Chamath：我可以在社会资本的背景下回答这个问题。所以我们在上个月做了一个非常大的转变，我们决定要建立一个看起来不同于风险投资公司的组织。  
That organization is going to be this hybrid, bastard-stepchild of Berkshire Hathaway and Blackstone and Blackrock.  
该组织将成为伯克希尔哈撒韦公司、黑石集团和黑石集团的混合体、私生子继子。

What I mean by this is, we want to have a large permanent capital base and we want to basically take really long discontinuous bets on companies and sectors and trends.  
我的意思是，我们希望拥有一个庞大的永久资本基础，并且我们希望基本上对公司、行业和趋势进行长期不连续的押注。  
One of the things we said we needed to do as part of that is we need to start really thinking through, having almost like a real estate fund. The reason we said that to ourselves was we owe it to our companies to alleviate some of these problems where nobody else is going to..  
我们说我们需要做的其中一件事是我们需要开始真正思考，几乎就像一个房地产基金。我们对自己这么说的原因是我们有责任为我们的公司减轻其中一些其他人无法做到的问题。  
If we went and built one million square feet somewhere of mixed-use work and live, and we completely conceptualized what it means to have a modular living environment for a millennial cohort of like, folks who want to work at companies who don’t necessarily have kids, etc.  
如果我们去建造 100 万平方英尺的混合用途工作和生活的地方，我们完全概念化了为千禧一代这样的人提供模块化生活环境意味着什么，这些人想在不一定在公司工作的人有孩子等  
We can do that in a way, and give that back to our CEOs, as a benefit of working with us.  
我们可以在某种程度上做到这一点，并将其回报给我们的首席执行官，作为与我们合作的好处。

You can probably make all the economics work, because frankly we only really care about the employee of the company anyways, and the equity in the long-term appreciation of real estate will take care of itself, if you take the 30-year view.  
你或许可以让所有的经济学都起作用，因为坦率地说，无论如何我们真正关心的只是公司的员工，如果你从 30 年的角度来看，房地产长期升值的权益会照顾好自己。  
So, we’re at that point now where we’re like, “Wow! We should probably just go raise a couple billion dollars and actually go get into the real estate business and solve this problem systematically for our companies.”  
所以，我们现在正处于那个时候，“哇！我们或许应该去筹集几十亿美元，真正进入房地产行业，为我们的公司系统地解决这个问题。”

Maybe in that, it becomes a blueprint for how others should do it. So that’s an example of a private solution to what would otherwise be a public solution that’s probably not going to happen.  
也许就这样，它成为其他人应该如何做的蓝图。所以这是一个私人解决方案的例子，否则可能不会发生的公共解决方案。  
So, we’re just basically going to act as our own little city-state, and decide how to do it ourselves.  
所以，我们只是基本上要充当我们自己的小城邦，并自己决定如何去做。  
In order to do that, companies will have to have the courage to be in San Mateo or San Carlos, and oh, by the way, every major $100M company has never been created north of Palo Alto, in case you’re curious.  
为了做到这一点，公司必须有勇气在圣马特奥或圣卡洛斯，哦，顺便说一下，如果你好奇的话，每家价值 1 亿美元的大公司都不会在帕洛阿尔托以北创建。

**Quick Thoughts On Today’s Seed Environment  
对当今种子环境的快速思考**

**Chamath**: I think it’s really amazing that there’s so many people that..  
Chamath：我认为有这么多人真的很了不起......  
I feel I have the same version of what all these other people feel, which is we all feel somewhere along the way we were a bit of an accidental tourist, we got lucky, there’s degrees of how lucky we all got, but we’re all then willing to pay it forward, and I see a lot of people, e.g.  
我觉得我和其他人的感受有相同的版本，那就是我们都觉得一路上的某个地方我们有点意外的游客，我们很幸运，我们都有不同程度的幸运，但我们然后所有人都愿意付出代价，我看到很多人，例如  
there’s a bunch of Facebook groups of ex-Facebook employees and the number of these people who are writing these really big checks into companies, and it’s not the amount of money that matters, it’s just that they’re willing to pay it forward.  
有一群由前 Facebook 员工组成的 Facebook 群组，以及这些人向公司开出这些非常大的支票的人数，重要的不是钱的数量，而是他们愿意向前支付。

So, whether they’re doing it with the profit motive or not, I think seed stage right now is very healthy. It’s robust.  
所以，不管他们是不是出于盈利动机，我认为现在的种子阶段是非常健康的。它很坚固。  
I think the institutionalized efforts around it, people are a little frustrated because they used to have so much proprietary deal flow and now all of a sudden, you can raise $2 million dollars from 10-15 folks who worked at WhatsApp or Facebook, or whatever.  
我认为围绕它的制度化努力，人们有点沮丧，因为他们曾经拥有如此多的专有交易流程，现在突然间，你可以从 10-15 名在 WhatsApp 或 Facebook 或其他公司工作的人那里筹集 200 万美元.

I think that’s fantastic. I hope there’s more of it. Frankly, as some number of us continue to feel out and be in this ecosystem, and be fortunate enough, you have a responsibility to plow back.  
我认为那太棒了。我希望还有更多。坦率地说，随着我们中的一些人继续感受并留在这个生态系统中，并且很幸运，你有责任重新耕耘。  
Somewhere along the way, it’s our responsibilities as institutions, to actually do a better job at enforcing discipline so that these guys can actually get a chance to get to this stage, and I think that that’s probably another thing where we’re not doing a great job.  
一路走来，作为机构，我们有责任更好地执行纪律，这样这些人才能真正有机会进入这个阶段，我认为这可能是我们没有做的另一件事做得好。  
There’s a lot of sheepish, “follow me” mentality.  
有很多害羞的，“跟我来”的心态。

**Series A & B Investors Need To Enforce Discipline  
A 系列和 B 系列投资者需要执行纪律**

**Chamath**: The problem right now, is that venture is completely undifferentiated. Everybody’s the same. Everybody’s the same. Everybody has a set of services that every other person has. So, when everybody’s theoretically different but the same, nobody has a backbone.  
Chamath：现在的问题是风险投资完全没有差异化。每个人都一样。每个人都一样。每个人都有一套其他人都有的服务。所以，当每个人在理论上不同但相同时，没有人有骨气。  
There’s fundamentally no authenticity in the marketplace. So as a result, nobody will ask these kinds of questions. Nobody will be disciplined.  
市场上基本上没有真实性。因此，没有人会问这类问题。没有人会受到纪律处分。  
In a company that’s not working, what they’re not thinking to themselves, is “Wow, maybe if we actually return $2M back, and actually capitalize these three other people with a different idea, or fund that young woman who I kicked out the door because I didn’t understand what she was saying.”  
在一家不运转的公司里，他们自己没有想到的是，“哇，也许如果我们真的返还 200 万美元，并实际利用这三个有不同想法的人，或者资助那个被我踢出去的年轻女人门，因为我听不懂她在说什么。”

So the discipline is important. Why? Because we have a responsibility to get the best ideas to market. We have the responsibility where we should be taking good capital risk.  
所以纪律很重要。为什么？因为我们有责任将最好的创意推向市场。我们有责任承担良好的资本风险。  
If at the end of this cycle, whenever this ends, we look at who made all the money, and it’s not Benchmark or Sequoia, or Social Capital or Andreesen, but it’s Pushman & Wakefield, WeWork, and ZeroCater, something’s wrong! Honestly guys, something’s wrong.  
如果在这个周期结束时，无论何时结束，我们看看谁赚了所有钱，不是 Benchmark 或 Sequoia，也不是 Social Capital 或 Andreesen，而是 Pushman & Wakefield、WeWork 和 ZeroCater，那就有问题了！老实说，伙计们，出了点问题。

So, that’s what I think about.. we have to start.. you don’t have to prognosticate doom and gloom and RIP good times, you don’t need to do that, but you do need to go in and say, let’s just dissect how we’re spending money, and none of this idiotic window-dressing nonsense.  
所以，这就是我的想法..我们必须开始..你不必预测厄运和忧郁，RIP 好时光，你不需要那样做，但你确实需要进去说，让我们只是剖析我们是如何花钱的，而不是这些愚蠢的粉饰门面的废话。  
And see how they react, because if the people don’t have the courage to make hard decisions, you’re probably wasting your money.  
看看他们的反应，因为如果人们没有勇气做出艰难的决定，你可能就是在浪费钱。

Now, not only are you doing a disservice to yourself and your and your own case, you’re really doing a disservice to all the employees who believe that CEO has the courage and the balls to make it happen, when really what they’re fucking doing is acting.  
现在，你不仅伤害了你自己和你自己的案子，你真的伤害了所有相信 CEO 有勇气和胆量实现它的员工，而实际上他们是他妈的就是演戏。  
They’re really just a walking failure just waiting for the last shoe to drop. And that’s a disservice to them. So you confront that person, give them a chance to change, and if they can’t change, then you better do something. That’s the hard work of building great companies.  
他们真的只是在等待最后一只鞋掉下来的行走失败。这对他们是一种伤害。所以你面对那个人，给他们改变的机会，如果他们不能改变，那么你最好做点什么。这就是建立伟大公司的艰苦工作。  
Not enough people are willing to do that.  
没有足够的人愿意这样做。
