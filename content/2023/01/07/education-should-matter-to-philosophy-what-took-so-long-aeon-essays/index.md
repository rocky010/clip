You might think it obvious that any list of topics worthy of sustained philosophical investigation would include education, along with mind, knowledge, language, morality and so on. Education, one would think, is a subject-matter of immense practical, real-world import that invites philosophical reflection, and that reflection in turn promises to illuminate not just education itself but some of philosophy’s most enduring questions. However, hardly any contemporary philosophers see things this way. Of course, most philosophers today work in institutions of higher education, and many take their teaching seriously and do a good job of it. So they care about education in that sense. They just don’t think that education matters as a subject of philosophical inquiry, and moreover, they take a rather dim view of those of us who do.

你可能认为很明显，任何值得持续进行哲学研究的主题清单都包括教育，以及思想、知识、语言、道德等。人们会认为，教育是一个具有巨大实用性、现实世界意义的主题，它会引发哲学反思，而这种反思反过来有望阐明的不仅是教育本身，还有一些哲学上最持久的问题。然而，几乎没有当代哲学家这样看待事物。当然，今天的大多数哲学家都在高等教育机构工作，许多人认真对待他们的教学并且做得很好。所以他们关心这个意义上的教育。他们只是不认为教育作为哲学探究的主题很重要，而且，他们对我们这些人的看法相当模糊。

The distinguished philosopher Philip Kitcher is an exception that proves this rule, but it is noteworthy that in the preface to his recent book, _The Main Enterprise of the World: Rethinking Education_ (2022), he laments that most philosophers think of the sub-discipline of ‘philosophy of education’ as an academic slum occupied by intellectual mediocrities who produce dull and unsophisticated work. Kitcher himself dissents from this view, but he is right that it’s the prevailing opinion. Most philosophers are content to see philosophy of education as a backwater, and are unmotivated to engage with it because they don’t believe that education matters to philosophy.

杰出的哲学家菲利普·基彻 (Philip Kitcher) 是证明这一规律的例外，但值得注意的是，在他最近出版的新书《世界的主要企业：重新思考教育》（2022 年）的序言中，他感叹大多数哲学家都认为这个子学科“教育哲学”被认为是一个学术贫民窟，里面住满了从事枯燥和简单工作的知识分子平庸者。 Kitcher 本人不同意这种观点，但他认为这是主流观点是正确的。大多数哲学家都满足于将教育哲学视为死水，并且没有动力参与其中，因为他们不相信教育对哲学很重要。

Lack of interest in education is not confined to analytic philosophy, but it is particularly marked in that tradition. I was an undergraduate at Keele University in the late 1970s and a doctoral student at Oxford in the 1980s. I don’t remember philosophers at either institution staging lectures or seminars on philosophy of education the entire time. It was only when I went to Russia to research the philosophical culture of the Soviet Union that I encountered thinkers who believed education to be of such critical importance in human life that no serious philosopher could fail to take an interest in it. Of course, that is not a distinctively Russian or Soviet view. Many luminaries in the history of philosophy have had things to say about education – Plato, Aristotle, Locke, Rousseau, Kant, Mill, Whitehead, and Dewey to name a few – and educational themes can be discerned in the writings of the later Wittgenstein, Iris Murdoch, and others, though this usually goes unnoticed and unremarked.

对教育缺乏兴趣不仅限于分析哲学，而且在该传统中尤为明显。 70 年代末我是基尔大学的本科生，80 年代是牛津大学的博士生。我不记得哲学家们一直在任何机构举办教育哲学讲座或研讨会。只有当我去俄罗斯研究苏联的哲学文化时，我才遇到认为教育对人类生活至关重要的思想家，任何严肃的哲学家都不会对此感兴趣。当然，这不是俄罗斯或苏联的独特观点。哲学史上的许多名人都对教育发表过看法——柏拉图、亚里士多德、洛克、卢梭、康德、密尔、怀特海和杜威等等——教育主题可以在后来的维特根斯坦的著作中辨别出来， Iris Murdoch 和其他人，尽管这通常不会引起注意和注意。

Admittedly, there was a brief period in the 1960s and 1970s when RS Peters, Paul Hirst, Robert Dearden and others at the Institute of Education in London brought the methods of analytic philosophy to bear on educational issues and encouraged a number of prominent philosophers, such as Gilbert Ryle, Michael Oakeshott and John Passmore to explore educational themes. And in the US, Israel Scheffler at Harvard produced significant writings on rationality and education. But while this ‘analytic philosophy of education’ inspired important work, its influence on the philosophical mainstream has been minimal, so that now the philosophy of education is often considered something no self-respecting philosopher need bother with, something that should be left to suitable persons in faculties of education and teacher training (a misconceived attempt at delegation since many such schools have long since lost interest in matters philosophical, but that’s another story).

诚然，在 1960 年代和 70 年代有一段短暂的时期，RS Peters、Paul Hirst、Robert Dearden 和伦敦教育学院的其他人将分析哲学的方法用于教育问题，并鼓励了一些著名的哲学家，例如Gilbert Ryle、Michael Oakeshott 和 John Passmore 探索教育主题。在美国，哈佛大学的 Israel Scheffler 撰写了关于理性和教育的重要著作。但是，尽管这种“分析教育哲学”启发了重要的工作，但它对哲学主流的影响微乎其微，因此现在教育哲学通常被认为是自尊的哲学家不需要费心的事情，应该留给合适的人教育和教师培训学院的人员（一种错误的授权尝试，因为许多此类学校早已对哲学问题失去兴趣，但这是另一回事）。

So let me spell out why exactly education _should_ matter to philosophy. The reason is that education makes us what we are. Human beings do not enter the world with their rational powers ‘up and running’. Those powers are actualised in the child in a process of formation, or education in the broadest sense (the ‘upbuilding’ of a human being, as Kitcher puts it, quoting Ralph Waldo Emerson). This occurs through the acquisition of natural language and the conceptual structures embodied therein, through initiation into styles of thinking and reasoning, and the assimilation of communal practices that structure the normative landscape in which children must learn to orientate themselves.

o 让我详细说明为什么教育对哲学很重要。原因是教育使我们成为现在的我们。人类进入世界时并没有“启动并运行”他们的理性力量。这些能力在孩子的形成过程中实现，或者在最广泛意义上的教育（正如基彻所说，引述拉尔夫·沃尔多·爱默生的话，“培养”一个人）。这是通过自然语言的习得和其中体现的概念结构，通过思维和推理方式的启蒙，以及对构建规范景观的社区实践的同化，儿童必须在其中学会自我定位。

Human individuals do not have to find the world anew; they are the beneficiaries of a cultural legacy, the appropriation of which enables them to relate to the world as an object of knowledge. This is true of every human child, though it applies equally to those who participate in any particular domain of knowledge. As philosophers, for example, we enter an ongoing conversation – to invoke a favourite image of the English philosopher Michael Oakeshott’s – and we have the benefit of, or are hampered by, that which has come before as it is manifested in contemporary belief and practice. Education is the [formation of reason](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Formation+of+Reason-p-9781444395594), the vehicle of human possibility. Anyone who wishes to understand the ways in which mind, reason and knowledge are expressed in human life had better have education in view.

人类个体不必重新寻找世界；他们是文化遗产的受益者，对文化遗产的利用使他们能够作为知识对象与世界联系起来。这对每个人类儿童都是如此，尽管它同样适用于那些参与任何特定知识领域的人。例如，作为哲学家，我们进入一场正在进行的对话——引用英国哲学家迈克尔·奥克肖特 (Michael Oakeshott) 最喜欢的形象——我们受益于或受阻于那些在当代信仰和实践中表现出来的东西.教育是理性的形成，是人类可能性的载体。任何人如果想了解人类生活中思维、理性和知识的表达方式，最好考虑接受教育。

If this is so, then ‘education’ refers not only to certain contingent practices of knowledge transmission, but to a constitutive element of the human life-form. To see this, it’s worth reflecting on what the American philosopher Michael Thompson in _Life and Action_ (2008) [calls](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674063983&content=reviews) ‘natural-historical judgment’, the kind deployed in biology textbooks, nature documentaries and natural history museums to characterise life-forms by saying, for example: ‘The wolf travels in a nuclear family consisting of a mated pair and their offspring, and engages in the cooperative hunting of prey, usually large, hoofed mammals and smaller animals’ or ‘In the mating season, the bull moose stops feeding for two weeks.’ It is important that such descriptions can be true of ‘the wolf’ or ‘the moose’, even though _this_ wolf might be lone, and _that_ moose might not fast. _The_ dog is four-legged, even if Fido has only three. Natural-historical description is thus inherently normative: it describes how a creature of this kind _ought_ to be. One who departs from the norm, such as poor Fido, is to that extent ‘abnormal’ or ‘defective’.

如果是这样，那么“教育”不仅指知识传播的某些偶然实践，而且指人类生命形式的构成要素。为了解这一点，值得反思美国哲学家迈克尔·汤普森 (Michael Thompson) 在《生命与行动》(2008) 中所说的“自然历史判断”，生物学教科书、自然纪录片和自然历史博物馆中使用的那种判断力，通过说来描述生命形式，例如：“狼在由一对配偶及其后代组成的核心家庭中旅行，并参与合作捕猎猎物，通常是大型有蹄哺乳动物和较小的动物”或“在交配季节，公麋停止进食两个星期。”重要的是，这样的描述可以适用于“狼”或“驼鹿”，即使这只狼可能是孤独的，而那只驼鹿可能不快。狗是四足的，即使 Fido 只有三个。因此，自然历史描述本质上是规范的：它描述了这种生物应该如何。偏离规范的人，例如可怜的 Fido，在某种程度上是“不正常的”或“有缺陷的”。

Since we are animals, natural-historical description of the human being should be possible. But can we, for instance, give a natural-historical description of what ‘the human being’ eats? The German philosopher Sebastian Rödl thinks not. Of course, we can say what the human digestive system can process. But an account of human food is a cultural-historical, not a natural-historical, undertaking. Human practices of food production, preparation and consumption show enormous [variation](https://aeon.co/essays/will-we-ever-get-a-clear-idea-about-what-foods-we-should-eat) across time and place, and any attempt to characterise them will take us swiftly into the history of horticulture, agriculture and animal husbandry, and into the cultural norms that govern what is consumed and how. And it’s not just food. Human beings do not have a ‘natural habitat’ any more than a natural diet, and there are no natural-historical truths about the [number](https://aeon.co/essays/having-children-is-not-life-affirming-its-immoral) of children human beings have, or how [parental duties](https://aeon.co/essays/there-really-is-no-natural-or-right-way-to-be-a-parent) are divided, or the role the extended [family](https://aeon.co/essays/why-childhood-and-old-age-are-key-to-our-human-capacities) plays in child-rearing, or about sexual preference or gender [identity](https://psyche.co/ideas/affirming-transgender-peoples-identities-is-more-than-politeness). And hence these practices are not governed by natural norms, deviation from which constitutes ‘defectiveness’.

因为我们是动物，所以对人类的自然历史描述应该是可能的。但是，例如，我们能否给出“人类”吃什么的自然历史描述？德国哲学家塞巴斯蒂安·罗德 (Sebastian Rödl) 不这么认为。当然，我们可以说人体消化系统能处理什么。但是，对人类食物的描述是一项文化历史的事业，而不是自然历史的事业。人类在食品生产、准备和消费方面的做法在不同时间和地点表现出巨大差异，任何对其进行表征的尝试都会使我们迅速进入园艺、农业和畜牧业的历史，并进入支配消费内容和消费方式的文化规范.这不仅仅是食物。人类没有比自然饮食更多的“自然栖息地”，关于人类有多少孩子，父母的责任如何分配，或大家庭在孩子中扮演的角色，没有自然历史的真相- 抚养，或关于性偏好或性别认同。因此，这些做法不受自然规范的支配，偏离自然规范就构成“缺陷”。

This shows, Rödl concludes (and I agree), that human beings do not have a nature in quite the way that nonhuman animals do; or, as he [puts it](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-9752.12415), relishing the paradox: a ‘human being has her nature not by nature’. We enjoy powers of self-determination that enable us to decide for ourselves what to think and do in light of what there is reason to think and do. This is what it is for a natural animal to be free. For us, the question ‘How should we live?’ is not decided by our biology but can always meaningfully be posed whatever constraints – physical, biological, historical, cultural – we may happen to labour under.

这表明，Rödl 总结道（我同意），人类并不像非人类动物那样具有本性。或者，正如他所说，享受这个悖论：“人有她的本性，而不是天生的”。我们享有自决权，使我们能够根据有理由思考和做的事情，自行决定思考和做的事情。这就是自然界动物的自由。对我们来说，“我们应该如何生活？”这个问题不是由我们的生物学决定的，而是总是可以有意义地提出任何限制——物理的、生物的、历史的、文化的——我们可能碰巧在其下工作。

In my view, however, there remains at least one natural-historical judgment that is true of the human: the human being is a rational animal, whose powers of reason are brought to actuality only through education. This captures the centrality of education to our life-form. The human child is born into a world in which reason is ‘externalised’ in so many forms – in spoken language, of course, but also in artefacts, in the written word and other media, in practices of enquiry, reasoning, teaching, and in copious forms of intelligent and creative activity. Children’s powers of reason find expression as they become at home in this world. But that doesn’t happen just by maturation. It’s possible only with the [help of others](https://aeon.co/essays/how-culture-works-with-evolution-to-produce-human-cognition). That’s why education is not a merely contingent addition to the human life-form. Education is reason’s vehicle.

然而，在我看来，至少有一个自然历史判断对人类是正确的：人类是一种理性的动物，其理性的力量只有通过教育才能实现。这抓住了教育对我们生命形式的中心地位。人类孩子出生在一个理性以多种形式“外化”的世界——当然是口头语言，但也有人工制品、书面文字和其他媒体，以及探究、推理、教学和实践的实践。在丰富形式的智能和创造性活动中。当孩子们在这个世界上变得熟悉时，他们的推理能力就会得到体现。但这并不仅仅是通过成熟发生的。只有在他人的帮助下才有可能。这就是为什么教育不仅仅是对人类生命形式的偶然补充。教育是理性的载体。

With this in view, it seems obvious that education should matter to philosophy. And not just because education raises new and unexplored issues, but because it provides opportunity for a fresh approach to old issues that philosophy has traditionally struggled with. We start to see, for instance, that an adequate epistemology must recognise that the manner in which knowledge is acquired, communicated and shared is internal to the nature of knowledge itself, and that the metaphysics of personhood needs to countenance the _formation_ of reason if we are to understand how rationality and animality are united in the human person.

鉴于此，教育对哲学应该很重要似乎是显而易见的。不仅因为教育提出了新的和未探索的问题，而且因为它为哲学传统上一直在努力解决的旧问题提供了新方法的机会。例如，我们开始看到，充分的认识论必须认识到，获取、传播和分享知识的方式内在于知识本身的本质，并且人格的形而上学需要支持理性的形成，如果我们是要了解理性和动物性是如何在人身上结合起来的。

To speak of education as the ‘formation of reason’ might seem to suggest a rather narrow, even elitist, focus on the cultivation of intellectual abilities – on interpretation, reasoning and argument conceived as skills of ‘critical thinking’. This is not my intention. I believe we should work with a more expansive conception of reason’s domain. It’s not just that we must consider reason in the service of determining what to believe (theoretical reason, so-called) _and_ reason devoted to deciding what to do (practical reason). We need to recognise that, in both the theoretical and the practical, responsiveness to reasons is not always the outcome of reasoning or deliberation.

将教育说成是“理性的形成”，这似乎意味着一种相当狭隘的、甚至是精英主义的关注，即关注智力的培养——关注被视为“批判性思维”技能的解释、推理和论证。这不是我的意图。我相信我们应该使用更广泛的理性领域概念。这不仅仅是因为我们必须考虑决定相信什么的理性（所谓的理论理性）和致力于决定做什么的理性（实践理性）。我们需要认识到，无论是在理论上还是在实践中，对原因的反应并不总是推理或深思熟虑的结果。

Push back against the dualistic assumptions that pedagogical thinking has often inherited from philosophy  
反对教学思维经常从哲学中继承的二元假设  

Of course, sometimes we think our way to a conclusion about what to think or do. But often our response to reasons is spontaneous and intuitive, more like perceptual awareness than logical thought. It’s as if we _see_ the contours of the normative terrain we are negotiating, and are moved accordingly. Musicians improvising together, soccer players perceptively running into space and interchanging passes, or artists creating ‘in the flow’, are no less navigating the ‘space of reasons’ than lawyers building a case, mathematicians setting out a proof, or financial experts weighing up the pros and cons of an investment strategy. Reason is operative in the former cases, no less than in the latter, even if the agents’ reasons can be described only retrospectively, and then perhaps by their showing, rather than telling, why they did what they did. So the formation of reason includes far more than the cultivation of powers of reasoning. It concerns how we come to understand the boundaries of appropriate behaviour, in learning how to play and pretend, express affection and love, make friends, stand up for oneself, control emotion, moderate desire, and so on. It thus begins in such mundane things as learning to eat with a spoon and to use the toilet, acquiring good sleep patterns, and it is presupposed by all the multivarious, norm-governed practices that pervade human life.

当然，有时我们会思考自己的方式来得出关于想什么或做什么的结论。但通常我们对原因的反应是自发的和直觉的，更像是感性意识而不是逻辑思维。就好像我们看到了我们正在谈判的规范领域的轮廓，并相应地移动了。音乐家一起即兴创作，足球运动员敏锐地跑入空间并交换传球，或者艺术家“在流动中”创作，与律师立案、数学家提出证明或金融专家权衡一样，他们也在“理性空间”中航行投资策略的优缺点。理性在前一种情况下是有效的，不亚于后者，即使代理人的原因只能回顾性地描述，然后也许通过他们展示而不是讲述他们为什么做了他们所做的事情。所以理性的形成远不止推理能力的培养。它涉及我们如何理解适当行为的界限，学习如何玩耍和假装、表达感情和爱、交朋友、维护自己、控制情绪、适度欲望等等。因此，它始于诸如学习用勺子吃饭和使用厕所、养成良好的睡眠模式等平凡的事物，并且它是遍及人类生活的所有多种多样的、规范管理的实践的先决条件。

Philosophy of education is particularly well placed to make sense of this and to push back against the dualistic assumptions – between mind and body, the rational and the emotional – that pedagogical thinking has often inherited from philosophy. Such binary oppositions inspire educational divisions between the academic and the applied, the intellectual and the vocational, the mental and the manual, where the former of each pair is consistently valued over the latter. But with a more expansive view of reason, we can appreciate how intelligence is embodied in practical activity in a way that challenges these class-bound dichotomies and makes, not just for better philosophy, but for richer ways of organising educational institutions, designing curricula, and understanding what it is to educate a person.

教育哲学特别适合理解这一点，并反对二元论假设——思想与身体、理性与情感之间的假设——教育思维通常从哲学中继承下来。这种二元对立激发了学术与应用、智力与职业、智力与体力之间的教育分歧，每一对中的前者始终比后者更受重视。但是，从更广泛的理性角度来看，我们可以理解智力是如何以一种挑战这些阶级界限的二分法的方式体现在实践活动中的，这不仅是为了更好的哲学，也是为了更丰富的组织教育机构、设计课程、并理解什么是教育一个人。

Consider, for example, the concept of habit. Philosophers have rarely had much to say about habit, and what they have said tends to construe habits as something mechanistic and non-rational. Even [Gilbert Ryle](https://aeon.co/essays/dont-just-do-it-think-it-too-on-learning-with-gilbert-ryle), for all his disdain for dualism, portrays a habit as an unintelligent pattern of behaviour established by ‘drilling’ (by which he means something like conditioning). But this does habit a disservice, because a great deal of habit informs intentional thought and action. Only consider ‘habits of mind’, which can surely embody intelligence. In educational contexts, developing the right kind of habits is crucial: habits of studying, reading, listening, speaking, explaining, considering and reconsidering, and so on (here I have in mind habits that govern not just _that_ one reads, studies or listens etc, but _how_ one does so). Once we grant that responsiveness to reasons does not require overt reasoning, we stand a chance of giving a more satisfying account of habit, which might in turn provoke serious educational thinking about its cultivation. It’s not just that education should matter to philosophy. Philosophy of the right kind can inform and inspire education.

例如，考虑一下习惯的概念。哲学家们很少谈论习惯，而且他们所说的往往将习惯解释为机械和非理性的东西。即使吉尔伯特赖尔，尽管他对二元论不屑一顾，但他将习惯描述为一种通过“训练”（他的意思是条件反射）建立起来的不明智的行为模式。但这确实对养成不利，因为大量的习惯会影响有意识的思考和行动。只考虑“思维习惯”，一定能体现智慧。在教育背景下，养成正确的习惯至关重要：学习、阅读、听力、口语、解释、思考和重新思考等习惯等等，但如何做到这一点）。一旦我们承认对原因的反应不需要明显的推理，我们就有机会对习惯做出更令人满意的解释，这反过来可能会引发对其养成的严肃教育思考。不仅仅是教育对哲学很重要。正确的哲学可以为教育提供信息和启发。

How likely is it that philosophers in the mainstream will wake up to education’s philosophical significance? I think that the prospects are good, because many of the prejudices that inhibited philosophers from taking education seriously are on the wane. For instance, the robust individualism that dominated so much analytic epistemology and philosophy of mind in the previous century – a legacy of British empiricism and 20th-century positivism – has yielded to an intellectual culture that is able, and often willing, to entertain ideas about the social preconditions of knowledge and mind. The field of social epistemology is now well established and, although its practitioners have been a little slow to interest themselves in education, it is easy to see there are fertile areas waiting to be explored. And in philosophy of mind, there is growing recognition that our mental lives are [embodied](https://aeon.co/videos/embodied-cognition-seems-intuitive-but-philosophy-can-push-it-to-some-strange-places) and [enacted](https://aeon.co/ideas/acting-changes-the-brain-its-how-actors-get-lost-in-a-role), and that they extend beyond the skull – views that, properly developed, can be allied to the expansive conception of reason that befits the study of education.

主流哲学家意识到教育的哲学意义的可能性有多大？我认为前景是好的，因为许多阻碍哲学家认真对待教育的偏见正在减弱。例如，在上个世纪主导如此多的分析认识论和心灵哲学的强大的个人主义——英国经验主义和 20 世纪实证主义的遗产——已经屈服于一种能够并且往往愿意接受关于知识和思想的社会先决条件。社会认识论领域现在已经很成熟，虽然它的实践者对教育的兴趣有点迟缓，但很容易看到有很多肥沃的领域等待探索。在心灵哲学中，人们越来越认识到我们的精神生活是具体化和制定的，并且它们超越了头骨——这种观点，如果得到适当的发展，可以与适合教育研究的广泛的理性概念相结合。

Moreover, philosophers today are also more willing to engage in work that requires them to be empirically informed, and to value interdisciplinary and collaborative research, and this should make them more open to exploring the messy actuality of education and its role in human development. Another salutary development is the gradual erosion of the division between analytic and [continental](https://aeon.co/essays/after-jacques-derrida-whats-next-for-french-philosophy) traditions of philosophy, enriching the terms of philosophical discourse and making available concepts, such as _Bildung_, that have no immediate correlate in Anglophone philosophy.

此外，今天的哲学家也更愿意从事需要他们以经验为依据的工作，并重视跨学科和合作研究，这应该使他们更愿意探索教育的混乱现状及其在人类发展中的作用。另一个有益的发展是分析哲学传统和大陆哲学传统之间的分歧逐渐消失，丰富了哲学话语的术语，并提供了可用的概念，例如 Bildung，这些在英语哲学中没有直接关联。

Schools and universities have a central role to play in any vibrant democracy  
学校和大学在任何充满活力的民主国家中都可以发挥核心作用  

Of course, one of the reasons that philosophy disdained education was no doubt sexism. In the male-dominated domain of analytic philosophy, with its fondness for methods adversarial and gladiatorial, it can be no real surprise that attention did not alight on issues relevant to the nurturing and upbringing of children. Fortunately, the philosophical universe is less male-dominated than it used to be and, though there may be a long way to go, its practitioners are now usually open to more constructive and less combative modes of engagement. But other obstacles remain. One is the tendency towards narrow specialisation that infects so much academic research, including philosophy. This is particularly disastrous for the study of education, where we often find epistemic, metaphysical, ethical and political matters densely interwoven. Another factor is that it is not unusual for philosophers to resent the time they spend teaching in educational institutions as a distraction from the real work of writing and research. So making education an object of one’s study might seem like a busman’s holiday, and perhaps that contributes to the feeling that doing philosophy of education is slumming it. But such a view is hard to sustain once one begins to see philosophical richness in the everyday realities of teaching and learning.

当然，哲学蔑视教育的原因之一无疑是性别歧视。在男性占主导地位的分析哲学领域，由于它喜欢对抗性和角斗士式的方法，因此注意力没有集中在与儿童的养育和教养相关的问题上也就不足为奇了。幸运的是，哲学世界不像过去那样以男性为主导，尽管可能还有很长的路要走，但它的实践者现在通常对更具建设性、更少好斗的参与模式持开放态度。但其他障碍依然存在。其一是狭隘专业化的趋势影响了如此多的学术研究，包括哲学。这对教育研究来说尤其具有灾难性，因为我们经常发现认识论、形而上学、伦理和政治问题紧密交织在一起。另一个因素是，哲学家通常会怨恨他们在教育机构任教的时间，因为这会分散他们对真正的写作和研究工作的注意力。因此，将教育作为一个人的研究对象可能看起来像是公共汽车司机的假期，也许这有助于让人产生这样一种感觉，即研究教育哲学正在使它陷入贫民窟。但是，一旦人们开始在日常教学现实中看到哲学的丰富性，这种观点就很难站得住脚。

I have made the case that education should matter to philosophy by arguing that education, very broadly conceived (as formation or self-development), is central to the human life-form, and by exploring some of the metaphysical and epistemic questions that come into view when one recognises this. I have said very little about the philosophical dimensions of formal education – schooling and higher education – and of course a good deal of work in philosophy of education is devoted to such matters. Indeed, those mainstream philosophers who have ventured into the field have usually done so to address moral and political issues raised by formal education. One familiar theme is that schools and universities have a central role to play in any vibrant democracy, equipping students, not just with relevant knowledge, but with the tools to think critically, so that they can make informed choices about how to live and contribute to democratic deliberation.

我已经证明教育应该对哲学很重要，我认为教育，非常广泛地理解（作为形成或自我发展），是人类生命形式的核心，并通过探索进入哲学的一些形而上学和认识论问题当人们认识到这一点时，请查看。关于正规教育（学校教育和高等教育）的哲学层面，我只谈了很少，当然，教育哲学中的大量工作都致力于此类问题。事实上，那些涉足该领域的主流哲学家通常这样做是为了解决正规教育提出的道德和政治问题。一个熟悉的主题是，学校和大学在任何充满活力的民主国家中都可以发挥核心作用，不仅为学生提供相关知识，还为学生提供批判性思考的工具，以便他们能够就如何生活和为社会做出贡献做出明智的选择民主审议。

Some have defended the [humanities](https://aeon.co/essays/the-humanities-are-booming-only-the-professors-can-t-see-it) and, more generally, a broadly liberal arts education, not just for honing critical reasoning, but for opening up to students things of genuine value, educating them in what matters, and thereby giving them a chance to choose among ways of living that are genuinely worthwhile. Sadly, throughout the world, and conspicuously in the United States, the ideals of democracy are so beleaguered that such discussions look increasingly utopian. But they are all the more relevant for that. For what can protect us, our children and our children’s children, from the post-truth world of alternative facts, the reduction of political discourse to lies, name-calling and abuse, from climate-crisis deniers, vaccine sceptics, and science-haters? What can inure us against conspiracy theories and the treacherous influence of social media? What can equip us to confront the injustices and evils of the past? Education – more and better – has to be a big part of the answer to these questions. That’s another blindingly obvious reason why philosophers should take education seriously.

有些人捍卫人文学科，更广泛地说，捍卫广泛的文科教育，不仅是为了磨练批判性推理，而且是为了向学生开放真正有价值的东西，在重要的事情上教育他们，从而让他们有机会选择各种方式真正值得的生活。可悲的是，在世界各地，尤其是在美国，民主理想如此受困，以至于这种讨论看起来越来越乌托邦。但它们与此更相关。什么可以保护我们、我们的孩子和我们孩子的孩子免受替代事实的后真相世界、将政治话语简化为谎言、辱骂和辱骂、免受气候危机否认者、疫苗怀疑论者和科学仇恨者的影响？什么可以使我们免受阴谋论和社交媒体的危险影响？什么可以装备我们去面对过去的不公正和罪恶？教育——更多更好——必须成为这些问题答案的重要组成部分。这是哲学家应该认真对待教育的另一个显而易见的原因。

Education’s relation to democracy is a central theme in a text I mentioned earlier: Philip Kitcher’s _The Main Enterprise of the World._ This book is an exemplary contribution to the philosophy of education and deserves to be taken seriously. Kitcher combines a broad vision of the centrality of education in human life with discussion of many concrete questions about how schools should be organised, curricula designed and so on. The discussion is framed by the big question: what is education for? He argues that the way politicians and policy-makers answer this question is usually distorted by economic priorities. They think educational institutions exist to prepare the young for the workforce, and thereby to contribute to their nation’s ability to compete in the global capitalist arena.

教育与民主的关系是我之前提到的一篇文章的中心主题：Philip Kitcher 的 The Main Enterprise of the World。这本书是对教育哲学的典范贡献，值得认真对待。基彻结合了教育在人类生活中的中心地位的广阔视野，以及对学校应该如何组织、课程设计等许多具体问题的讨论。讨论围绕着一个大问题展开：教育的目的是什么？他认为政治家和政策制定者回答这个问题的方式通常会被经济优先事项所扭曲。他们认为教育机构的存在是为了让年轻人为劳动力做好准备，从而为他们国家在全球资本主义舞台上的竞争能力做出贡献。

But such an answer is myopic and, moreover, out of step with economic reality. With increasing automation and global outsourcing, there will be less and less desirable work to prepare students for, and the majority of tomorrow’s workforce will find itself in service jobs. In light of this, we must rethink our priorities. We need to recognise the value of service work and reward it accordingly. And we need to embrace the view that education exists to prepare students not just to make a living, but to lead flourishing lives, and to equip them for democratic citizenship. If there are ways that economic reality is out of kilter with this richer conception of education, then we should put education first and change reality accordingly.

但这样的答案是短视的，而且不符合经济现实。随着自动化和全球外包的增加，可供学生准备的理想工作将越来越少，明天的大部分劳动力将从事服务工作。有鉴于此，我们必须重新考虑我们的优先事项。我们需要认识到服务工作的价值并相应地给予奖励。我们需要接受这样一种观点，即教育的存在不仅是为了让学生谋生，而且是为了过上幸福的生活，并让他们成为民主公民。如果经济现实与这种更丰富的教育理念不协调，那么我们应该把教育放在首位，并相应地改变现实。

Kitcher embraces [John Stuart Mill](https://aeon.co/ideas/suffering-not-just-happiness-weighs-in-the-utilitarian-calculus)’s view that a flourishing life must be ‘one’s own’ as it were – a life one has, in some sense, _chosen_. This means that we must educate for autonomy, so that students are enabled to decide for themselves how to live. Of course, we want to equip students not just to choose, but to make _good_ choices. How are we to reconcile this ‘perfectionist’ sensibility with liberalism’s reluctance to take a stand on where the good lies? Kitcher responds by introducing a social dimension into his vision of flourishing. Individuals’ life-projects should be freely chosen, but they should aim not just at personal flourishing, but at the flourishing of others, including future generations. Our lives must contribute to the human project by being to the benefit of humankind.

基彻拥护约翰·斯图尔特·穆勒 (John Stuart Mill) 的观点，即繁荣的生活必须是“自己的”生活——从某种意义上说，这是一个人选择的生活。这意味着我们必须进行自主性教育，让学生能够自己决定如何生活。当然，我们不仅要让学生学会选择，还要让他们做出正确的选择。我们如何调和这种“完美主义者”的敏感性与自由主义不愿就善所在而采取立场的态度？ Kitcher 的回应是在他的繁荣愿景中引入社会维度。个人的人生计划应该是自由选择的，但他们的目标不应只是个人的繁荣，而是他人的繁荣，包括子孙后代。我们的生活必须造福于人类，从而为人类事业做出贡献。

This view takes inspiration from [John Dewey](https://aeon.co/essays/dewey-knew-how-to-teach-democracy-and-we-must-not-forget-it), and so too does Kitcher’s conception of education and democracy. Kitcher – who, as it happens, is John Dewey Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Columbia University in New York – is inspired by Dewey’s idea of democracy as a way of life. Because the institutions of representative democracy are prone to familiar failings, he endorses Dewey’s conception of deliberative democracy in which inclusive, informed and engaged dialogue among citizens seeks outcomes that are acceptable to all, in a spirit of mutual recognition and respect. If such a vision is to be realised, children must be introduced to democratic practice as early as possible, so this must become part of the ethos of the school.

这种观点的灵感来自约翰杜威，基彻的教育和民主概念也是如此。基彻——碰巧是纽约哥伦比亚大学约翰·杜威名誉哲学教授——受到杜威将民主作为一种生活方式的理念的启发。由于代议制民主制度容易出现常见的失败，他赞同杜威的协商民主概念，即本着相互承认和尊重的精神，公民之间进行包容、知情和参与的对话，寻求所有人都能接受的结果。如果要实现这样的愿景，就必须尽早向孩子们介绍民主实践，因此这必须成为学校风气的一部分。

It would require massive social change for such a conception of education to become reality  
要使这种教育理念成为现实，需要进行大规模的社会变革  

As for curriculum, Kitcher favours a broad general education in science and mathematics with specialised studies limited to those who are genuinely interested in pursuing science seriously. He also makes a strong case for the humanities, music and the arts. Aesthetic experience, he argues, is a vital part of life but, since the range of such experience is vast, and individual responses so variable, students should be helped to find forms of literature, art or music they enjoy and can relate to. Such attention to the interests of the individual learners is crucial to Kitcher’s vision of pedagogy, so class size is to be kept as small as possible (eg, under 10 students) and teachers should be complemented by educational aides from the wider community, who can share their experiences, counsel, enlighten and inspire. As they mature, students should be helped to explore the diversity of human possibility through increasingly sophisticated forms of history, geography, psychology and social science. Just as democracy is a way of life, so too is education, and opportunities for participation in formal education – as students, teachers or as both at once – should be open to citizens throughout their lives.

至于课程，基彻喜欢广泛的科学和数学通识教育，而专门研究仅限于那些真正有兴趣认真追求科学的人。他还为人文、音乐和艺术提供了强有力的支持。他认为，审美体验是生活的重要组成部分，但由于这种体验的范围很广，而且个人反应也各不相同，因此应该帮助学生找到他们喜欢并与之相关的文学、艺术或音乐形式。这种对个体学习者兴趣的关注对于 Kitcher 的教育学愿景至关重要，因此班级规模应尽可能小（例如，10 名学生以下），教师应辅以来自更广泛社区的教育助手，他们可以分享他们的经验、建议、启发和启发。随着他们的成熟，应该帮助学生通过日益复杂的历史、地理、心理学和社会科学形式探索人类可能性的多样性。正如民主是一种生活方式，教育也是如此，参与正规教育的机会——作为学生、教师或同时作为两者——应该对公民终生开放。

Kitcher is aware that it would require massive social change for such a conception of education to become reality. In addition to respecting all forms of socially valuable work, we must do away with the obscene inequalities of wealth, eradicate the stereotypes and prejudices that are impediments to mutual recognition and epistemic justice, quieten the desire for the mindless [accumulation](https://aeon.co/ideas/conspicuous-consumption-is-over-its-all-about-intangibles-now) of cheap consumer goods, and overcome the relentless economic imperative to maximise [productivity](https://aeon.co/essays/the-rest-cure-challenges-cherished-myths-about-a-working-body). Only then can we have a ‘Deweyan society’ in which citizens, committed to life-long education, flourish in a truly democratic order where they devote themselves to finding mutually acceptable solutions to the problems, big and small, that confront them.

基彻意识到，要使这种教育理念成为现实，需要进行大规模的社会变革。除了尊重所有形式的具有社会价值的工作之外，我们还必须消除可憎的财富不平等，消除阻碍相互承认和认知正义的刻板印象和偏见，平息盲目积累廉价消费品的欲望，以及克服最大化生产力的无情的经济需要。只有这样，我们才能拥有一个“杜威社会”，在这个社会中，致力于终身教育的公民在真正民主的秩序中蓬勃发展，他们致力于为他们面临的大小问题寻找双方都能接受的解决方案。

All this might seem utopian, but it would be wrong to dismiss Kitcher’s bold vision as wishful thinking or revolutionary posturing. True to Dewey, his aim is actually [pragmatic](https://aeon.co/essays/pragmatism-is-one-of-the-most-successful-idioms-in-philosophy): to articulate ideals to enable us to move gradually from where we are towards something better. The challenge is not to build a utopia from scratch, but to solve a kind of simultaneous equation – since the creation of a society in which education finds its proper place itself depends on education – by steadily working towards the mutual rejuvenation of education and society guided by ideals that are open to revision in light of how things go. Kitcher takes heart from examples of the dramatic moral progress that has occurred in recent years, for example on such matters as [gender equality](https://aeon.co/essays/do-analytic-and-continental-philosophy-agree-what-woman-is) and [same-sex marriage](https://aeon.co/essays/at-last-america-changes-its-mind-on-gay-marriage). These are cases where beliefs, attitudes and practices that were once derided are now widely endorsed. If such moral progress is possible, then maybe the Deweyan society is too.

所有这一切似乎都是乌托邦式的，但将基彻的大胆设想视为一厢情愿或革命姿态是错误的。对杜威来说，他的目标实际上是务实的：阐明理想，使我们能够逐渐从我们所处的地方走向更好的事物。挑战不是从零开始建立一个乌托邦，而是解决一种联立方程式——因为一个教育在其中找到合适位置的社会的创建本身取决于教育——通过稳步努力实现教育和社会的共同振兴根据可以根据事情的进展情况进行修改的理想。基彻从近年来发生的戏剧性道德进步的例子中汲取灵感，例如在性别平等和同性婚姻等问题上。在这些案例中，曾经被嘲笑的信仰、态度和做法现在得到了广泛认可。如果这种道德进步是可能的，那么也许杜威社会也是如此。

Kitcher’s book makes vivid why education should matter to philosophy. Its publication is important for, when a thinker of Kitcher’s stature turns to an issue, this is likely to attract attention. This will, I hope, stimulate new interest in philosophical studies of education. And this is all to the good, so long of course that those so stimulated do not think of the field as virgin soil, but take an interest in what has already been achieved by philosophers of education. Kitcher makes reference to a number of figures he respects (including Harry Brighouse, Randall Curren, Catherine Elgin, Meira Levinson and John White), but there are many others he might have drawn on. Not only is there much insightful writing on Dewey’s educational ideas, but there are numerous philosophers of education who have fruitfully pursued many of the issues Kitcher addresses from a wide variety of perspectives (for example, René Arcilla, Nicholas Burbules, Joseph Dunne, Jan Derry, Megan Laverty, Michael Peters, Paul Smeyers, Richard Smith, Paul Standish, and Christopher Winch, to name but a few).

基彻的书生动地阐述了为什么教育对哲学很重要。它的出版很重要，因为当像基彻这样的思想家转向一个问题时，这很可能会引起注意。我希望这会激发对教育哲学研究的新兴趣。这一切都是好的，当然，只要那些如此兴奋的人不认为这个领域是处女地，而是对教育哲学家已经取得的成就感兴趣。 Kitcher 提到了许多他尊敬的人物（包括 Harry Brighouse、Randall Curren、Catherine Elgin、Meira Levinson 和 John White），但他可能还借鉴了许多其他人物。不仅有很多关于杜威教育思想的有见地的著作，而且还有许多教育哲学家从各种不同的角度（例如，René Arcilla、Nicholas Burbules、Joseph Dunne、Jan Derry）卓有成效地研究了 Kitcher 提出的许多问题, Megan Laverty, Michael Peters, Paul Smeyers, Richard Smith, Paul Standish, and Christopher Winch, 仅举几例）。

I do not mean to be critical of Kitcher. Given the breadth of his vision, and the amount of ground his ambitious book has to cover, he can only do so much. But to those he convinces that education matters to philosophy, I recommend they spend some time with the recently published _Handbook of Philosophy of Education_ (2022), edited by Randall Curren, which presents a fascinating array of philosophical inquiries into a multiplicity of educational matters, showcasing many of the leading practitioners. This should leave you in no doubt that the philosophical study of education is not an intellectual slum, but a rather attractive and engaging city of ideas.

我并不是要批评基彻。考虑到他的视野之广，以及他那本雄心勃勃的著作所涵盖的范围之广，他能做的也就这么多了。但对于那些他认为教育对哲学很重要的人，我建议他们花些时间阅读最近出版的教育哲学手册（2022 年），该手册由 Randall Curren 编辑，其中对多种教育问题进行了一系列引人入胜的哲学探究，展示了许多领先的从业者。这应该让你毫不怀疑，教育哲学研究不是一个知识分子的贫民窟，而是一个相当有吸引力和引人入胜的思想之城。
