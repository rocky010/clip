## Evaluating the impact of UX research is hard. Here is a framework that can help.

“Perf” is a shorthand for “performance review” at Google, and yes, it’s that time again to evaluate the impact of our work and determine who gets raises and promotions. As a UX research (UXR) manager, it’s my job to help my colleagues understand how they should look at the impact of UXR, which many found not as straightforward or as quantifiable as some other disciplines.

“Perf”是谷歌“绩效评估”的简写，是的，又到了评估我们工作的影响并确定谁获得加薪和晋升的时候了。作为一名用户体验研究 (UXR) 经理，我的工作是帮助我的同事了解他们应该如何看待 UXR 的影响，许多人发现 UXR 不像其他学科那样直接或可量化。

There are two fundamental challenges in evaluating UXR impact: a long time horizon and limited control of its usage. First, the impact of a study might take some time to realize from its completion. This is especially true for [foundational research](https://medium.com/facebook-research/getting-started-with-foundational-ux-48dd244b763e) which is intended to build a baseline understanding of potential users and their needs before the team even starts designing or building a product. Second, UXR might have indirect or little control over how their research gets used by others in the organization. This is usually not an issue for researchers in an agency setting, since impact is realized when the research report is accepted by the client. But for in-house researchers, there is an expectation that research needs to lead to changes in product design or revenue to be considered impactful.

评估 UXR 影响有两个基本挑战：时间跨度长和对其使用的控制有限。首先，一项研究的影响可能需要一些时间才能在完成后体现出来。对于旨在在团队甚至开始设计或构建产品之前建立对潜在用户及其需求的基线理解的基础研究尤其如此。其次，UXR 可能间接或很少控制他们的研究如何被组织中的其他人使用。对于机构环境中的研究人员来说，这通常不是问题，因为当研究报告被客户接受时，影响就会实现。但对于内部研究人员而言，人们期望研究需要导致产品设计或收入发生变化才能被视为有影响力。

Wrestling with these two challenges initially as an individual contributor and more recently as a manager led me to a mental framework that has helped me better articulate my team’s impact and set the right expectations about what stakeholders can get out of engaging with the UXR team. This framework builds upon my understanding of the core job UXR does —

最初作为个人贡献者和最近作为经理应对这两个挑战使我建立了一个心理框架，该框架帮助我更好地阐明我的团队的影响并对利益相关者可以从与 UXR 团队的接触中获得什么设定正确的期望。这个框架建立在我对 UXR 所做的核心工作的理解之上——

_producing knowledge about product users and product designs to support decision making  
产生有关产品用户和产品设计的知识以支持决策制定  
_. Breaking down this understanding of the UXR role, I arrived in the following three levels of impact:  
打破对 UXR 角色的这种理解，我得出以下三个影响级别：

-   Level 1: research questions answered  
    级别 1：回答研究问题  
    
-   Level 2: decisions supported 级别 2：支持的决策
-   Level 3: user value generated Level 3：产生用户价值

As the diagram below illustrates, the higher levels of impact not only take longer to realize but also depend on the influence of the UXR team and the organization’s capacity to act on research rather than individual researcher’s expertise and diligence.

如下图所示，更高水平的影响不仅需要更长的时间才能实现，而且还取决于 UXR 团队的影响力和组织对研究采取行动的能力，而不是个别研究人员的专业知识和勤奋程度。

In this diagram, Level 1 of UXR impact is situated near the top-left corner, Level 2 is in the middle, and Level 3 is near the bottom-right corner.](1tdGL7lOMDyNWd3UgmPNXww.png)

A framework for thinking about the impact of UX research  
思考用户体验研究影响的框架  

Realizing the first level of research impact is relatively straightforward: the researcher needs to answer important research questions and answer them really well. Every business faces uncertainty in their decision making, and UXR helps reduce that uncertainty through collecting, analyzing, and reporting data about users and how they use the product. This uncertainty is usually expressed as questions the team asks or should have asked — sometimes we don’t know what we don’t know.

实现第一级研究影响相对简单：研究人员需要回答重要的研究问题并很好地回答这些问题。每个企业在决策过程中都面临着不确定性，而 UXR 通过收集、分析和报告有关用户以及他们如何使用产品的数据来帮助减少这种不确定性。这种不确定性通常表现为团队提出或应该提出的问题——有时我们不知道我们不知道什么。

When research questions are well defined and reflect what the team really needs to know, the first level of research impact can be assessed almost immediately after the delivery of the final research report, based on whether or not stakeholders feel the research questions have been answered satisfactorily and the uncertainty that prompted the research has been reduced if not eliminated.

当研究问题定义明确并反映团队真正需要知道的内容时，第一级研究影响几乎可以在最终研究报告交付后立即评估，评估的依据是利益相关者是否认为研究问题得到了令人满意的回答促使研究的不确定性即使没有消除也已经减少。

Picking the right question to answer is as important as, if not more important than, answering the question well. If the research addresses an inconsequential question, its impact will be limited regardless of how well it is carried out. Therefore, it’s very important to make sure all stakeholders are aligned not only on what the research deliverables will look like, but also why and why not this research should be done early in the research planning process.

选择正确的问题来回答与正确回答问题同样重要，甚至更重要。如果研究解决了一个无关紧要的问题，那么无论其执行得如何，其影响都将是有限的。因此，非常重要的是要确保所有利益相关者不仅在研究成果的外观上保持一致，而且在研究计划过程的早期就为什么以及为什么不应该进行这项研究保持一致。

The second level of research impact is about decisions informed by the research. Those decisions could involve any work across design, engineering, product management, marketing, operations, etc. This means that the stakeholders of the research not only agreed with and accepted the research findings, but they also found ways to apply what they learned in places that could directly add value to the product or the organization. It’s important to note that cancelling an activity that was assumed or planned, because of what the research has suggested is also a legitimate form of research impact.

研究影响的第二个层次是关于研究提供的决策。这些决策可能涉及设计、工程、产品管理、营销、运营等方面的任何工作。这意味着研究的利益相关者不仅同意并接受研究结果，而且他们还找到了将所学知识应用到地方的方法可以直接为产品或组织增加价值。重要的是要注意取消假设或计划的活动，因为研究表明也是一种合法的研究影响形式。

Nonetheless, a well-done research study doesn’t always lead to explicit or immediate decisions. Sometimes the solution space for a problem uncovered through research can be highly ambiguous, though a correct framing and a rich description of the problem can often pave the way to finding the right solution eventually. That’s why [socialization of research](https://www.answerlab.com/insights/creative-approaches-to-socialize-research-insights-and-build-empathy) is an ongoing and long-term activity. Someone needs to remember that the organization already “knows” this and brings up the knowledge at the right time.

尽管如此，一项出色的研究并不总是会导致明确或立即做出决定。有时，通过研究发现的问题的解决方案空间可能非常模糊，但正确的框架和对问题的丰富描述通常可以为最终找到正确的解决方案铺平道路。这就是为什么研究社会化是一项持续和长期的活动。有人需要记住，组织已经“知道”这一点，并会在正确的时间提出这些知识。

The final level of research impact is realized when the research has generated measurable value to the user through well-made business decisions informed by the research results. It can take months, sometimes years, to confirm the research has had an impact at this level. To do this well and consistently, the organization needs to invest in systematic measurements and cultivating a culture of [project landing](https://simple-pdh.com/launching-and-landing-a-new-product/) instead of launching. Good business or design decisions, especially those that can stand the test of time, reflect the quality of research that supported those decisions.

当研究通过以研究结果为依据的精心制定的业务决策为用户产生了可衡量的价值时，研究影响的最终水平就实现了。可能需要数月，有时甚至数年时间，才能确认研究在这个层面上产生了影响。为了做好并始终如一地做到这一点，组织需要投资于系统的测量并培养项目落地而不是启动的文化。好的商业或设计决策，尤其是那些经得起时间考验的决策，反映了支持这些决策的研究质量。

These three levels of impact are related to the career growth of UX researchers. An entry-level UXR should aim to achieve the first-level impact by answering well-defined research questions independently. As the individual gains more experiences and organizational context, they are expected to actively influence and support cross-functional decision making. Finally, a UXR Lead role embraces the responsibility for creating a culture and processes to ensure the whole organization regularly makes sound, data-based decisions.

这三个层面的影响与用户体验研究人员的职业发展有关。入门级 UXR 应该旨在通过独立回答明确定义的研究问题来实现第一级影响。随着个人获得更多经验和组织背景，他们有望积极影响和支持跨职能决策。最后，UXR Lead 角色承担了创建文化和流程的责任，以确保整个组织定期做出合理的、基于数据的决策。
