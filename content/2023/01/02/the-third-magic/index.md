This post is essentially a rewrite of a big and half-formed idea that [I wrote on my old blog eight years ago](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2014/10/three-ways-of-understanding-world.html). I was deeply dissatisfied with that post, but I thought it contained a few interesting seeds. So now I’m trying again, and will undoubtedly fail again. But hopefully something else interesting will come out of the attempt.

这篇文章本质上是对我八年前在我的旧博客上写的一个大而半成形的想法的重写。我对那个帖子深感不满，但我认为它包含了一些有趣的种子。所以现在我再试一次，毫无疑问会再次失败。但希望这次尝试会产生其他有趣的东西。

Humanity’s living standards are vastly greater than those of the other animals. Many people attribute this difference to our greater intelligence or our greater linguistic communication ability. But without minimizing the importance of those underlying advantages, I’d like to offer the idea that our material success is due, in large part, to two great innovations. Usually we think of innovations as specific technologies — agriculture, writing, the wheel, the steam engine, the computer. The most important of these are the things we call “general purpose technologies”. But I think that at a deeper level, there are more profound and fundamental meta-innovations that underlie even those things, and these are _ways of learning about the world_.

人类的生活水平远远高于其他动物。许多人将这种差异归因于我们更高的智力或更强的语言交流能力。但是，在不低估这些潜在优势的重要性的情况下，我想提出这样的观点，即我们的物质成功在很大程度上归功于两项伟大的创新。通常我们认为创新是特定的技术——农业、写作、轮子、蒸汽机、计算机。其中最重要的是我们称之为“通用技术”的东西。但我认为，在更深层次上，甚至在这些事情的基础上，还有更深刻、更基本的元创新，这些都是了解世界的方式。

Humans’ first big meta-innovation, roughly speaking — the first thing that lifted us above an animal existence — was _history_. By this, I don’t just mean the chronicling of political events and social trends that we now call “history”, but basically any knowledge that’s recorded in language — instructions on how to farm, family genealogies, techniques for building a house or making bronze, etc. Originally these were recorded in oral traditions, but these are a very lossy medium; eventually, we started writing knowledge down, and then we got [agricultural manuals](https://www.shuge.org/ebook/nong-shu/), almanacs, [math books](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9780691219813-030/pdf), and so on. That’s when we really got going.

粗略地说，人类的第一个重大元创新——使我们超越动物存在的第一件事——是历史。在这里，我指的不仅仅是我们现在称之为“历史”的政治事件和社会趋势的编年史，而是基本上任何以语言记录的知识——关于如何耕种的说明、家族谱系、建造房屋或制作房屋的技术青铜等。最初这些是在口述传统中记录的，但这些是一种非常有损的媒介；最终，我们开始把知识写下来，然后我们得到农业手册、年历、数学书等等。那是我们真正开始的时候。

[Animals make tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZM9GpLXepU), but they don’t collectively remember how to make those tools. History, especially written history, is what allows tinkering to stick — it means that when one human finds an ingenious new way of doing something, there’s a good chance that many other humans, and eventually _all_ humans, will know how to do it. And of course those techniques can then build on each other over time. In the modern day we think of history as primarily a social science, but fundamentally it’s the foundation of technology as well; it’s the thing that lifted us from an almost animal existence into the agricultural age.

动物制造工具，但它们并不共同记住如何制造这些工具。历史，尤其是书面历史，是让修修补补得以延续的原因——这意味着当一个人找到一种巧妙的新做事方式时，其他许多人，最终是所有人类，很有可能会知道如何去做。当然，随着时间的推移，这些技术可以相互借鉴。在现代，我们认为历史主要是一门社会科学，但从根本上说，它也是技术的基础；是它把我们从几乎是动物的存在带入了农业时代。

Then — I won’t say exactly when, because it wasn’t a discrete process and the argument about exactly when it occurred is kind of boring — humanity discovered our second magic trick, our second great meta-innovation for gaining control over our world. This was _science_.

然后——我不会说确切的时间，因为它不是一个离散的过程，而且关于它发生的确切时间的争论有点无聊——人类发现了我们的第二个魔术，我们第二个伟大的元创新来控制我们的世界.这是科学。

“History”, as I think of it, is about chronicling the past, passing on and accumulating _information_. “Science", by contrast, is about figuring out generally applicable _principles_ about how the world works. Chronicling the motions of the planets is one thing; being able to predict the motion of planets you’ve never discovered is quite another. Tinkering with steam engines and writing down your findings can lead to progress; understanding the principles of thermodynamics and being able to use those to _design_ a better engine, without having to tinker for decades or centuries, is far more effective.

“历史”，在我看来，就是记录过去，传递信息，积累信息。相比之下，“科学”是关于找出关于世界如何运转的普遍适用原则。记录行星的运动是一回事；能够预测你从未发现的行星的运动是另一回事。修补蒸汽引擎并写下您的发现可以带来进步；了解热力学原理并能够使用这些原理设计更好的引擎，而无需修补数十年或数百年，这要有效得多。

Science is often done in a lab, but it doesn’t have to be. Ecologists can derive laws for predator-prey relationships simply by observing nature. Kepler didn’t need to do experiments with gravity in order to write down laws of planetary motion that would hold generally true. Nor do you need math to do science; many of the principles that govern the world can be expressed purely in words and pictures. But just as writing supercharged the process of recording events, controlled experimentation and mathematics supercharged the process of discovering the laws of the Universe.

科学研究通常在实验室中完成，但并非必须如此。生态学家可以简单地通过观察自然来推导出捕食者与猎物关系的规律。开普勒不需要用引力做实验来写下普遍适用的行星运动定律。你也不需要数学来做科学；许多支配世界的原则可以纯粹用文字和图片来表达。但是，正如写作增强了记录事件的过程一样，受控实验和数学也增强了发现宇宙规律的过程。

Controlled experiments are powerful because they let you go from the small to the large — you can [roll balls down a ramp in your house](https://galileoandeinstein.phys.virginia.edu/lectures/gal_accn96.htm), and use that to figure out the laws of motion that control the motions of the stars. You can [grow peas in your yard](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/gregor-mendel-and-the-principles-of-inheritance-593/) and use these to figure out laws of heredity. And mathematics is powerful because it lets you express those laws in ways that are easy to use across a dizzying breadth of applications. If you’re an artilleryman, field manuals embodying decades or centuries of cumulated experience can tell you how to calibrate the range and accuracy of your cannon; physics, derived from experiments with little wooden balls and expressed in mathematics, can [tell you how to hit a target](https://www.napoleon-series.org/military-info/organization/c_velocity.html) with far less trial and error.

受控实验之所以强大，是因为它们可以让你从小到大——你可以把球滚下你家的斜坡，然后用它来找出控制星星运动的运动定律。你可以在你的院子里种豌豆，并用它们来找出遗传规律。数学之所以强大，是因为它可以让您以易于在各种令人眼花缭乱的应用程序中使用的方式表达这些定律。如果您是一名炮兵，那么包含数十年或数百年积累经验的战地手册可以告诉您如何校准大炮的射程和精度；源自小木球实验并用数学表达的物理学可以告诉你如何用更少的试验和错误击中目标。

If you think about it, it’s pretty incredible that the world actually works that way. If you went up to someone in the year 1500 and told them that one kooky hobbyist rolling little balls down ramps could be right about how the physical world works, when the cumulated experience of millions of human beings around him was wrong, and that his insights could be written down by [an even kookier kook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_of_Principia_Mathematica) in an arcane language that few could speak, and that this language would allow its speakers to apply the laws to do wondrous feats that others couldn’t possibly do, they would have thought you were crazy. They _did_ think that was crazy. And yet, it worked. It [worked](https://www.antonhowes.com/uploads/2/1/0/8/21082490/spread_of_improvement_working_paper.pdf) more [spectacularly](https://rootsofprogress.org/relationship-of-the-scientific-and-industrial-revolutions) than anything had ever worked before, and the [economic result](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/book-review-slouching-toward-utopia) looked like this:

如果你仔细想想，世界实际上是这样运作的，这真是令人难以置信。如果你去找 1500 年的某个人并告诉他们一个古怪的业余爱好者将小球滚下斜坡可能是正确的关于物理世界如何运作的，而他周围数百万人的累积经验是错误的，并且他的见解可以由一个更古怪的怪人用一种很少有人会说的神秘语言写下来，并且这种语言将允许它的说话者运用法律来做其他人不可能做的奇妙壮举，他们会认为你疯了。他们确实认为那很疯狂。然而，它奏效了。它的效果比以往任何时候都好，经济结果如下所示：

[![](https3A2F2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com2Fpublic2Fimages2F8f68394d-e9c9-4b41-81c7-80224975a487_3400x2400.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f68394d-e9c9-4b41-81c7-80224975a487_3400x2400.png)

In 1960, the physicist Eugene Wigner wrote an essay called “[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/wigner.pdf)”. It’s really not about math so much as it’s about the fact that such a thing as simple, generalizable “laws of the universe” exist in the first place. Why should principles like physical laws or the basics of genetics be so simple, and yet so generalizable and consistent across time and space? There’s no obvious reason this should be true, and yet it is.

1960 年，物理学家尤金·维格纳 (Eugene Wigner) 发表了一篇名为《自然科学中数学的不合理有效性》的文章。这真的不是关于数学，而是关于这样一个事实，即简单、可概括的“宇宙法则”首先存在。为什么像物理定律或遗传学基础这样的原理应该如此简单，但又如此普遍且跨时空一致？没有明显的理由认为这是真的，但事实确实如此。

Well, for _some_ things it is. Charles Marcus, my freshman physics teacher, told me that “physics is great, but it will never tell you how to make a tree.” That [wasn’t](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2307/2656967) _[entirely](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2307/2656967)_ [true](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2307/2656967). But it is true that a whole lot of complex phenomena have so far defied the approach that gave us the laws of physics and genetics. Language, cognition, society, economics, complex ecologies — these things so far don’t have any equivalent of Newton’s Laws, and it’s not clear they ever will.

好吧，对于某些事情来说是这样。我的大一物理老师查尔斯·马库斯 (Charles Marcus) 告诉我，“物理学很棒，但它永远不会告诉你如何制作一棵树。”这不完全正确。但确实，到目前为止，许多复杂现象都违背了为我们提供物理学和遗传学定律的方法。语言、认知、社会、经济学、复杂的生态学——到目前为止，这些东西都没有与牛顿定律等价的东西，而且也不清楚它们是否会出现。

This problem has been recognized for a very long time, and thinkers tried several approaches to get around it. Some hoped that all complex phenomena would be governed by [emergent properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) — that simplicity would emerge at higher levels of complexity, allowing us to discover simple laws for things like psychology and economics even without connecting those laws to the underlying physics. Indeed, this idea is implicit (or, occasionally, [explicit](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2016/06/the-pool-player-analogy-is-silly.html)) in the way economists try to write down simple mathematical laws of collective human behavior. People make fun of this approach as “physics envy”, but sometimes it really works; auction theory isn’t derived from physics, but it has been able to make very effective predictions about how much people will pay for Google ads or spectrum rights. Ditto for “[gravity models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_model_of_trade)” of trade, migration, retail shopping, etc. Sometimes emergence works.

这个问题已经被认识到很长时间了，思想家们尝试了几种方法来解决它。一些人希望所有复杂现象都受涌现属性的支配——简单性会在更高层次的复杂性中出现，从而使我们能够发现心理学和经济学等事物的简单法则，即使不将这些法则与基础物理学联系起来。事实上，在经济学家试图写下人类集体行为的简单数学定律的方式中，这个想法是隐含的（或偶尔是明确的）。人们取笑这种方法为“物理学嫉妒”，但有时它确实有效；拍卖理论并非源自物理学，但它已经能够非常有效地预测人们将为谷歌广告或频谱权支付多少费用。贸易、移民、零售购物等的“引力模型”也是如此。有时涌现会奏效。

Sometimes, though, it doesn’t — or at least, it doesn’t yet. But in [psychology](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.609802/full), in [macroeconomics](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/macroeconomics-is-still-in-its-infancy), in natural language processing, and many other domains, the search for laws of nature has been mostly stymied so far, and it’s not clear when real progress might ever be made. Wigner goes so far as to postulate that some domains of human knowledge might _never_ be described by such simple, generalizable principles.

但有时，它并没有——或者至少，现在还没有。但在心理学、宏观经济学、自然语言处理和许多其他领域，对自然规律的探索迄今大多受阻，而且尚不清楚何时才能取得真正的进展。维格纳甚至假设人类知识的某些领域可能永远无法用如此简单、可概括的原则来描述。

Other approaches for getting around the problem of complexity — chaos theory, complexity theory — yielded interesting insights, but ultimately didn’t succeed in giving us substantially more mastery of the phenomena they dealt with. In the late 20th century, the problem of complexity was like a looming wall up ahead — as scientists found more and more of the laws that could be found, a larger and larger percentage of the remaining problems were things where laws seemed very hard or potentially even impossible to find.

解决复杂性问题的其他方法——混沌理论、复杂性理论——产生了有趣的见解，但最终没有成功地让我们更好地掌握它们所处理的现象。在 20 世纪后期，复杂性问题就像一堵若隐若现的高墙——随着科学家发现越来越多的规律，剩下的问题中越来越多的问题是规律似乎非常困难或可能存在的问题甚至不可能找到。

Our second great magic, powerful though it had proven to be, was still not omnipotent.

我们的第二大魔法虽然已经被证明是强大的，但仍然不是万能的。

In 2001, the statistician Leo Breiman wrote an essay called “[Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures](http://www2.math.uu.se/~thulin/mm/breiman.pdf)”, in which he described an emerging split between statisticians who were interested in making _parsimonious models_ of the phenomena they modeled, and others who were more interested in _predictive accuracy_. He demonstrated that in a number of domains, what he calls “algorithmic” models (early machine learning techniques) were yielding consistently better predictions than what he calls “data models”, even though the former were far less easy, or even impossible, to interpret.

2001 年，统计学家利奥·布雷曼 (Leo Breiman) 撰写了一篇名为“统计建模：两种文化”的文章，他在文中描述了一种新出现的分歧，即有兴趣为所建模的现象制作简约模型的统计学家，以及其他对预测更感兴趣的人准确性。他证明，在许多领域，他所谓的“算法”模型（早期的机器学习技术）始终比他所谓的“数据模型”产生更好的预测，尽管前者远没有那么容易，甚至不可能解释。

This raises an important question: What is the goal of human knowledge? As I see it — and as Breiman sees it — the fundamental objective is not understanding but _control_. By recording which crops grow in which season, we can feed our families. By understanding that germs cause disease, we can know to wash our hands or get a vaccine, and lower our risk of death. In these situations, knowledge and understanding might be intrinsically satisfying to our curiosity, but that satisfaction ultimately pales in importance to our ability to reshape our world to our benefit. And the “algorithmic” learning models that Breiman talks about were better able to deliver their users the power to reshape the world, even if they offered less promise of understanding what they were predicting.

这就提出了一个重要的问题：人类知识的目标是什么？正如我所见——正如布雷曼所见——根本目标不是理解而是控制。通过记录哪些作物在哪个季节生长，我们可以养家糊口。通过了解细菌会导致疾病，我们可以知道洗手或接种疫苗，从而降低死亡风险。在这些情况下，知识和理解可能从本质上满足我们的好奇心，但这种满足最终会淡化我们重塑世界以造福于我们的能力。 Breiman 谈论的“算法”学习模型能够更好地为用户提供重塑世界的力量，即使他们不太可能理解他们的预测。

Why should we care about _understanding_ the things we predict? To most of us, raised and inculcated in the age of science, that might seem like a laughable question, but there actually is a good reason. “Understanding”, in the scientific sense, means deriving a simple, generalizable principle that you can apply in other domains. You can write down Kepler’s laws of planetary motion, but Newton’s laws of motion and gravitation let you generalize from planetary orbits to artillery shells. Collapsing observed phenomena to simple, generalizable laws and then expanding these laws again in some other domain to allow you to control other phenomena is fundamental to the awesome power of science. So because you and I sit at the end of 400 years of science being the most powerful tool in the world, we have naturally been taught that it is very, very important to _understand_ things.

为什么我们应该关心理解我们预测的事情？对于我们大多数在科学时代成长和灌输的人来说，这似乎是一个可笑的问题，但实际上有一个很好的理由。 “理解”，在科学意义上，意味着推导出一个简单的、可概括的原则，你可以将其应用到其他领域。你可以写下开普勒行星运动定律，但牛顿运动定律和万有引力定律可以让你从行星轨道概括到炮弹。将观察到的现象分解为简单的、可概括的规律，然后在其他领域再次扩展这些规律以允许您控制其他现象，这是科学强大力量的基础。所以因为你和我坐在 400 年的末尾，科学是世界上最强大的工具，我们自然而然地被教导理解事物是非常非常重要的。

But what if, sometimes, there are ways to generalize from one phenomenon to another _without_ finding any simple “law” to intermediate between the two? Breiman sadly never lived to see his vision come to fruition, but that is exactly what the people who work in machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly doing. In 2009 — just before the deep learning revolution really kicked off — the Google researchers Alon Halevy, Peter Norvig, and Fernando Pereira wrote an essay called “[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/35179.pdf)” that picked up the argument where Breiman left off. They argued that in the cases of natural language processing and machine translation, applying large amounts of data was effective even in the absence of simple generalizable laws. A few excerpts:

但是，如果有时有办法从一种现象推广到另一种现象，而无需找到任何简单的“规律”来介于两者之间呢？遗憾的是，Breiman 没有活着看到他的愿景实现，但这正是从事机器学习和人工智能工作的人们越来越多地在做的事情。 2009 年——就在深度学习革命真正开始之前——谷歌研究人员 Alon Halevy、Peter Norvig 和 Fernando Pereira 写了一篇名为“数据的不合理有效性”的文章，从 Breiman 结束的地方继续争论。他们认为，在自然语言处理和机器翻译的情况下，即使没有简单的可概括的规律，应用大量数据也是有效的。一些摘录：

> \[S\]ciences that involve human beings rather than elementary particles have proven more resistant to elegant mathematics…An informal, incomplete \[list of the grammatical rules that define\] the English language runs over 1,700 pages. Perhaps when it comes to natural language processing and related fields, we’re doomed to complex theories that will never have the elegance of physics equations. But if that’s so, we should stop acting as if our goal is to author extremely elegant theories, and instead embrace complexity and make use of the best ally we have: the unreasonable effectiveness of data…
> 
> \[S\] 涉及人类而不是基本粒子的科学已被证明更能抵抗优雅的数学......一个非正式的，不完整的 \[定义语法规则的列表\] 英语超过 1,700 页。也许当涉及到自然语言处理和相关领域时，我们注定会遇到永远不会像物理方程那样优雅的复杂理论。但如果是这样，我们就应该停止表现得好像我们的目标是编写极其优雅的理论，而是拥抱复杂性并利用我们拥有的最佳盟友：数据的不合理有效性......
> 
> So, follow the data…Represent all the data with a nonparametric model rather than trying to summarize it with a parametric model, because with very large data sources, the data holds a lot of detail. For natural language applications, trust that human language has already evolved words for the important concepts. See how far you can go by tying together the words that are already there, rather than by inventing new concepts with clusters of words. Now go out and gather some data, and see what it can do.
> 
> 因此，遵循数据……用非参数模型表示所有数据，而不是试图用参数模型对其进行总结，因为对于非常大的数据源，数据包含很多细节。对于自然语言应用程序，相信人类语言已经为重要概念进化出单词。通过将已经存在的单词组合在一起，而不是通过使用单词簇来发明新概念，看看你能走多远。现在出去收集一些数据，看看它能做什么。

(Note: ChatGPT, the chatbot that has recently [wowed the world](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/01/while-anticipation-builds-for-gpt-4-openai-quietly-releases-gpt-3-5/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANv_wS9iSvtZHRKljyB3OiWunulSO0rNmseCOFZqQIftLZbjaXZRe2KzHGWNFsKRWN_rl8UL_195rPga8oS8FzPAo1kkEWG7gp3eftl2LupOMsrp8kAi2skcsvLW7ijYjUexrJ09lJ1nlaD3kGqvFvOMShGloI5cXjnPRmD9cU9I), is a parametric model, but I wouldn’t get too hung up on that little detail. In terms of interpretability, a model with 175 billion parameters is not really different from one with no parameters at all.)

（注意：ChatGPT，最近让世界惊叹的聊天机器人，是一个参数模型，但我不会太在意那个小细节。在可解释性方面，一个有 1750 亿个参数的模型与一个模型并没有什么不同完全没有参数。）

Anyway, the basic idea here is that many complex phenomena like language have underlying regularities that are _difficult to summarize_ but which are still _possible to generalize_. If you have enough data, you can create a model (or, if you prefer, an “AI”) that can encode many (all?) of the fantastically complex rules of human language, and apply them to conversations that have never existed before. As a demonstration of how powerful this can be, let’s ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) about the subject of this post:

无论如何，这里的基本思想是许多复杂的现象，如语言，都有潜在的规律性，这些规律性难以概括，但仍然可以概括。如果你有足够的数据，你可以创建一个模型（或者，如果你愿意的话，一个“AI”），它可以编码许多（全部？）人类语言极其复杂的规则，并将它们应用到以前从未存在过的对话中.为了证明这有多强大，让我们向 ChatGPT 询问这篇文章的主题：

The ability to write down farming techniques is power. The ability to calculate the path of artillery shells is power. And the ability to have a machine reliably and consistently write paragraphs as clear and helpful as the one above is _power_, even if we don’t really understand the principles of how it’s doing what it does.

能记下耕作技术就是力量。计算炮弹路径的能力就是力量。让一台机器可靠、一致地写出像上面那样清晰有用的段落的能力就是力量，即使我们并不真正理解它如何做它所做的事情的原则。

This power is hardly limited to natural language processing and chatbots. In recent years, Google’s AlphaFold algorithm [has outpaced traditional scientific methods](https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2020/12/08/alphafold2-casp14-it-feels-like-ones-child-has-left-home/) in predicting the shapes of folded proteins. Biologist Mohammed AlQuraishi wrote that:

这种力量不仅限于自然语言处理和聊天机器人。近年来，谷歌的 AlphaFold 算法在预测折叠蛋白质的形状方面已经超过了传统的科学方法。生物学家 Mohammed AlQuraishi 写道：

> There was, in many ways, a broad sense of existential angst felt by most academic researchers \[in the field\]…\[those\] who have bet their careers on trying to obsolete crystallographers are now worried about getting obsoleted ourselves.
> 
> 在很多方面，\[该领域\] 的大多数学术研究人员都感受到了一种广泛的存在主义焦虑感……\[那些\] 将自己的职业生涯押在试图淘汰晶体学家的人现在担心自己会被淘汰。

We are almost certainly going to call this new type of prediction technique “science”, at least for a while, because it deals with fields of inquiry that we have traditionally called “science”, like protein folding. But I think this will obscure more than it clarifies. I hope we eventually come up with a new term for this sort of black-box prediction method, not because it’s better or worse than science, but because it’s _different_.

我们几乎肯定会将这种新型预测技术称为“科学”，至少在一段时间内是这样，因为它涉及我们传统上称为“科学”的研究领域，例如蛋白质折叠。但我认为这会掩盖更多而不是澄清。我希望我们最终能为这种黑盒预测方法提出一个新术语，不是因为它比科学更好或更差，而是因为它不同。

A big knock on AI is that because it doesn’t really let you understand the things you’re predicting, it’s unscientific. And in a formal sense, I think this is true. But instead of spending our effort on a neverending (and probably fruitless) quest to make AI fully interpretable, I think we should recognize that science is only one possible tool for predicting and controlling the world. Compared to science, black-box prediction has both strengths and weaknesses.

对 AI 的一大打击是，因为它并不能真正让你理解你所预测的事情，所以它是不科学的。从形式上讲，我认为这是真的。但是，我认为我们应该认识到，科学只是预测和控制世界的一种可能工具，而不是将我们的精力花在永无止境（而且可能毫无结果）的探索上，以使 AI 完全可解释。与科学相比，黑盒预测既有优点也有缺点。

One weakness — the downside of being “unscientific” — is that without simple laws, it’s harder to anticipate when the power of AI will fail us. Our lack of knowledge about AI’s internal workings means that we’re always in danger of [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting) and [edge cases](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/lovecraftian-intelligence). In other words, the “third magic” may be more like actual magic than the previous two — AI may always be powerful yet ineffable, performing frequent wonders, but prone to failure at fundamentally unpredictable times.

一个弱点——“不科学”的缺点——是如果没有简单的法律，就很难预测人工智能的力量何时会让我们失望。我们缺乏对 AI 内部工作原理的了解，这意味着我们总是处于过度拟合和边缘情况的危险之中。换句话说，“第三种魔法”可能比前两种更像是真正的魔法——人工智能可能总是强大而又难以言喻，经常创造奇迹，但在根本无法预测的时候容易失败。

But even wild, occasionally-uncontrollable power is real power.  
但即使是狂野的、偶尔无法控制的力量也是真正的力量。  

It’s impossible to know, just yet, _how_ powerful this new technique will be. Perhaps AI will be a niche application, or perhaps it will revolutionize all the fields of endeavor where traditional science has run into diminishing returns. Just as none of the scientists in the 1600s knew how many wonders their theories would eventually produce, we have no idea how far the third magic will take us. People may look back on this post in half a century and laugh at how I dared to frame AI as an epistemological successor to history and science. Or perhaps AI will lead to a leap in human power and flourishing comparable to those in the two graphs above.

目前还无法知道这项新技术的威力有多大。也许 AI 将是一个小众应用，或者它可能会彻底改变传统科学收益递减的所有领域。正如 1600 年代的科学家都不知道他们的理论最终会产生多少奇迹一样，我们也不知道第三种魔法会带我们走多远。人们可能会在半个世纪后回顾这篇文章，并嘲笑我如何敢于将 AI 定义为历史和科学的认识论继承者。或许人工智能会带来人类力量的飞跃和繁荣，可与上面两张图相媲美。

As always, we won’t know until we try.  
与往常一样，我们只有尝试才能知道。  

Let’s briefly circle back to [my old 2014 post](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2014/10/three-ways-of-understanding-world.html). One reason I’m dissatisfied with that post is that I focused on ways of “understanding” the world, but as ChatGPT notes above, understanding isn’t the only thing we care about when we’re trying to make predictions and control our world. A second thing I’m dissatisfied with is that I presented empirics — statistical analysis of uncontrolled observational data — as a third tool, separate from science and history. With some time to reflect, I see less of a distinction to be made there. Observing correlations might involve some fancy math, but conceptually it isn’t that different from marking down the patterns of the seasons or the orbits of the planets. And using observational data to uncover the laws of nature — like predator-prey models — is really just another way of doing traditional science.

让我们简单地回到我 2014 年的旧帖子。我对这篇文章不满意的一个原因是我专注于“理解”世界的方式，但正如 ChatGPT 上面指出的那样，当我们试图做出预测和控制我们的世界时，理解并不是我们唯一关心的事情.我不满意的第二件事是，我将经验——不受控制的观察数据的统计分析——作为第三种工具，独立于科学和历史。有一些时间来反思，我认为那里没有什么区别。观察相关性可能涉及一些奇特的数学，但从概念上讲，它与标记季节模式或行星轨道并没有什么不同。使用观测数据来揭示自然法则——比如捕食者-猎物模型——实际上只是传统科学的另一种方式。

I do think I was right, though, to see natural experiments as something a bit different. In the past few decades, as economics has moved [away from theory and toward empirics](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2016-01-06/how-economics-went-from-theory-to-data?sref=R8NfLgwS), the [most important innovation](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-08-02/how-economics-went-from-philosophy-to-science?sref=R8NfLgwS) has been the use of natural experiments — situations where some policy change or seemingly random difference allows you to tell yourself that you’re looking at causation, rather than just correlation. This is different than what I call “history”, because you’re doing more than just documenting facts; you’re verifying causal links. But it’s also different from science, because a lot of the time you don’t exactly know _why_ the causal links are there. In a way, a natural experiment is its own sort of black-box prediction algorithm.

不过，我确实认为我是对的，将自然实验视为有点不同的东西。在过去的几十年里，随着经济学从理论转向经验，最重要的创新是自然实验的使用——一些政策变化或看似随机的差异让你告诉自己你正在寻找因果关系的情况，而不仅仅是相关性。这与我所说的“历史”不同，因为你所做的不仅仅是记录事实；您正在验证因果关系。但它也不同于科学，因为很多时候你并不完全知道为什么存在因果关系。在某种程度上，自然实验本身就是一种黑盒预测算法。

A number of subfields of econ, however, are so complex, with so many feedback systems, that they’ve [largely resisted](https://docs.iza.org/dp4800.pdf) the natural experiment approach. These include not just [the study of business cycles](https://www.nber.org/papers/w21228) (what most people call “macro”), but also the study of economic growth, international finance, and a number of others. In these fields, theory (including “structural estimation”) still rules, but predictive power is very low.

然而，经济学的许多子领域非常复杂，具有如此多的反馈系统，以至于它们在很大程度上抵制了自然实验方法。这些不仅包括对商业周期（大多数人称之为“宏观”）的研究，还包括对经济增长、国际金融和许多其他方面的研究。在这些领域，理论（包括“结构估计”）仍然占主导地位，但预测能力很低。

Might we apply AI tools to these hard problems, in order to predict vast economic forces without needing to understand them? [A recent paper by Khachiyan et al.](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29569) argues that the answer is “yes”. The authors use deep neural nets (i.e., AI) to look at daytime satellite imagery, in order to predict future economic growth at the hyper-local level. The results they achieve are nothing short of astonishing:

我们是否可以将人工智能工具应用于这些难题，以便在不需要理解它们的情况下预测巨大的经济力量？ Khachiyan 等人最近发表的一篇论文。认为答案是“是”。作者使用深度神经网络（即 AI）来查看白天的卫星图像，以预测超本地级别的未来经济增长。他们取得的成果令人震惊：

> For grid cells with lateral dimensions of 1.2km and 2.4km (where the average US county has dimension of 55.6km), our model predictions achieve R2 values of 0.85 to 0.91 in levels, which far exceed the accuracy of existing models, and 0.32 to 0.46 in decadal changes, which have no counterpart in the literature and are 3-4 times larger than for commonly used nighttime lights.

> 对于横向尺寸为 1.2km 和 2.4km 的网格单元（美国县平均尺寸为 55.6km），我们的模型预测 R2 值达到 0.85 到 0.91 的水平，远远超过现有模型的精度，0.32 到 0.32 到0.46 的年代际变化，在文献中没有对应的变化，比常用的夜间灯光大 3-4 倍。

This isn’t yet AlphaFold, but being able to predict the economic growth of a few city blocks 10 years into the future with even 30% or 40% accuracy is leaps and bounds ahead of anything I’ve ever seen. It suggests that rather than being utter incomprehensible chaos, some economic systems have patterns and regularities that are too complex to be summarized with simple mathematical theories, but which nevertheless can be captured and generalized by AI.

这还不是 AlphaFold，但能够以 30% 或 40% 的准确率预测未来 10 年几个城市街区的经济增长，这在我所见过的任何事情中都是突飞猛进的。它表明，一些经济系统并非完全不可理解的混乱，而是具有过于复杂而无法用简单的数学理论概括的模式和规律，但仍然可以被人工智能捕捉和概括。

And this is just a first-pass attempt, by a team with relatively limited resources. What if the people at DeepMind were to tackle the questions of economic growth and business cycles, with even bigger data sets and more advanced models? Khachiyan et al.’s paper raises the possibility that in a decade or two, macroeconomics might go from being something we simply theorize about to something we can anticipate — and therefore, something we can control. The authors suggest place-based policies, transportation infrastructure construction, and disaster relief as three possible applications of their work.

这只是资源相对有限的团队的一次尝试。如果 DeepMind 的人要用更大的数据集和更先进的模型来解决经济增长和商业周期的问题，会怎样？ Khachiyan 等人的论文提出了这样一种可能性，即在一两年内，宏观经济学可能会从我们简单地理论化的东西变成我们可以预期的东西——因此，我们可以控制的东西。作者建议将基于地方的政策、交通基础设施建设和救灾作为他们工作的三种可能应用。

This is just one example that happens to be near and dear to my heart (and which inspired me to write this post). But it’s just one example of how fields of inquiry that seemed like impossible cliffs just a few years ago may seem like easily scalable boulders in a year or a decade or a century, thanks to a grand new meta-innovation in how we predict and control the world around us. That’s what happened with the scientific revolution, and there’s no obvious reason why it might not happen again. Just the possibility should make us dizzy with excitement.

这只是我心中最亲近的一个例子（也是它激发了我写这篇文章的灵感）。但这只是一个例子，说明几年前看似不可能的悬崖的研究领域在一年、十年或一个世纪后可能看起来像易于攀登的巨石，这要归功于我们预测和控制方式的全新元创新我们周围的世界。这就是科学革命所发生的事情，而且没有明显的理由说明它不会再次发生。只是这种可能性就应该让我们兴奋得头晕目眩。
