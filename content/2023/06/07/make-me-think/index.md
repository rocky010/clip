Until recently everyday objects were shaped by their technology. The design of a telephone was basically a hull around a machine. **The task of the designers** was to **make technology look pretty**.  
直到最近，日常物品都是由他们的技术塑造的。电话的设计基本上是围绕机器的船体。设计师的任务是让技术看起来很漂亮。

It was up to the **engineers** to **define the interfaces** of those objects. Their main concern was **the function of the machine, not its ease of use**. We — the “users” — had to figure out how they worked.  
由工程师来定义这些对象的接口。他们主要关心的是机器的功能，而不是它的易用性。我们——“用户”——必须弄清楚他们是如何工作的。

With every technological innovation our everyday objects became richer and increasingly complex. Designers and engineers simply **burdened the users with this increase in complexity**. I am still having nightmares [trying to get a train ticket from the old BART vending machines in San Francisco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kyl2g11KSqc).  
随着每一次技术创新，我们的日常物品变得越来越丰富和复杂。设计师和工程师只是用这种复杂性的增加来增加用户的负担。我仍然做噩梦，试图从旧金山的旧BART自动售货机上买火车票。

### From complicated to simple  
从复杂到简单

Fortunately, UX (User eXperience) designers have found ways to design beautiful interfaces that are easy to use. Their process can resemble a philosophical enquiry, where they constantly ask questions such as: **What is this really about? How do we perceive this? What is our mental model?**  
幸运的是，UX（用户体验）设计师已经找到了设计易于使用的漂亮界面的方法。他们的过程可能类似于哲学探究，他们不断提出诸如以下问题：这到底是关于什么的？我们如何看待这一点？我们的心智模式是什么？

![][fig4]

Today, as a result of their efforts, we interact with wonderfully designed interfaces. **Designers have been taming complexity for us**. They make extremely sophisticated technology appear simple and easy to use.  
今天，由于他们的努力，我们与设计精美的界面进行了交互。设计师一直在为我们驯服复杂性。它们使极其复杂的技术看起来简单易用。

![][fig5]

### From simple to too simple  
从简单到太简单

And easy sells well. Thus more and more products are based on the promise to **make our lives easier** by **using increasingly complex technologies with ever simpler interfaces**.  
而且容易卖得很好。因此，越来越多的产品基于通过使用越来越复杂的技术和更简单的界面使我们的生活更轻松的承诺。

![][fig6]

Just tell your phone what you want and things will appear magically — whether it is the information on a screen or a package delivered to your doorstep. A **gigantic amount of technologies and infrastructure** is domesticated by brave designers and engineers who make all this work.  
只需告诉你的手机你想要什么，事情就会神奇地出现——无论是屏幕上的信息还是送到你家门口的包裹。大量的技术和基础设施是由勇敢的设计师和工程师驯化的，他们使这一切得以实现。

![][fig7]

But we don’t see — let alone understand — what is going on behind the scenes, behind the simple appearance. **We are kept in the dark**.  
但我们看不到——更不用说理解——幕后发生了什么，在简单的表象背后。我们被蒙在鼓里。

You should see me whining like a spoiled brat when a video call is not working as smoothly as expected — all those interruptions and the bad sound quality! An experience which would have appeared nothing short of a **miracle** to people just 50 years ago and which requires the operation of a colossal infrastructure has become an expected normality for me.  
你应该看到我像个被宠坏的小子一样抱怨，当视频通话没有像预期的那样顺利时——所有这些中断和糟糕的音质！这种经历在50年前对人们来说简直就是一个奇迹，需要运营庞大的基础设施，这对我来说已经成为一种预期的常态。

**We fail to appreciate and to empathise because we don’t understand what is going on.  
我们没有欣赏和同情，因为我们不明白发生了什么。**

So does technology makes us dumb? This question isn’t really new. Famously Plato warned us about the detrimental effects of writing — which we know of because he wrote them down.  
那么技术会让我们变得愚蠢吗？这个问题并不新鲜。著名的柏拉图警告我们写作的有害影响——我们知道这一点，因为他把它们写下来了。

### The problem with “user centered” design  
“以用户为中心”设计的问题

In his **excellent** book “Living with complexity” Donald Norman offers numerous strategies for how designers can harness the design of complexity to **improve the user experience**.  
唐纳德·诺曼（Donald Norman）在他的优秀著作《与复杂性共存》（Living with complexity）中，为设计师如何利用复杂性设计来改善用户体验提供了许多策略。

And there lies a problem.  
而且存在一个问题。

I am increasingly wary of the term “**user centered design**”. The word “user” has a second meaning — “consumer of drugs”— which implies **dependance, short-sighted gratification and a reliable source of income for the “dealer”**. The word “centered” excludes pretty much everyone and everything else.  
我对“以用户为中心的设计”一词越来越警惕。“使用者”一词有第二个含义——“毒品消费者”——这意味着依赖、短视的满足和“经销商”的可靠收入来源。“居中”这个词几乎排除了所有人和其他一切。

### A holistic approach to complexity  
应对复杂性的整体方法

As an alternative we should widen our perspective and ask questions such as:  
作为替代方案，我们应该拓宽视野并提出以下问题：

#### Empowerment: Who’s having the fun?  
赋权：谁玩得开心？

Maybe being able to speak a foreign language is more fun than using a translation software.  
也许会说外语比使用翻译软件更有趣。

Whenever we are about to substitute a laborious activity such as learning a language, cooking a meal, or tending to plants with a — deceptively — simple solution, we might always ask ourselves: **Should the technology grow — or the person using it?**  
每当我们要用一种看似简单的解决方案来代替一项艰苦的活动，比如学习一门语言、做一顿饭或照料植物，我们可能总是会问自己：技术应该发展——还是使用它的人？

![][fig10]

#### Resilience: Does it make us more vulnerable?  
韧性：它会让我们更加脆弱吗？

Highly sophisticated systems work flawlessly, **as long as things go as expected**.  
高度复杂的系统可以完美运行，只要事情按预期进行。

When a problem occurs which hasn’t been anticipated by the designers, those systems are prone to fail. **The more complex the systems are, the higher are the chances that things go wrong**. They are less resilient.  
当出现设计人员没有预料到的问题时，这些系统很容易出现故障。系统越复杂，出错的可能性就越大。它们的弹性较差。

![][fig11]

A chronic dependance on a combination of electronics, artificial intelligence and a high speed internet connection for the simplest tasks is a recipe for disaster. It makes our lives more complicated, especially when we don’t understand what is going on behind the deceptively simple interface.  
长期依赖电子设备、人工智能和高速互联网连接来完成最简单的任务是灾难的秘诀。它使我们的生活变得更加复杂，尤其是当我们不了解看似简单的界面背后发生了什么时。

#### Empathy: What is the impact of simplification on others?  
同理心：简化对他人有什么影响？

Our decisions have consequences for ourselves and others. **A simplified appearance can make us blind to those consequences**.  
我们的决定会对我们自己和他人产生影响。简化的外观会使我们对这些后果视而不见。

![][fig12]

Our decision what smart phone to buy or what to have for dinner has a huge impact on other living beings. Knowing about the complexity behind such a decision can be of tremendous value. **We need to know things better if we want to be better**.  
我们决定买什么智能手机或晚餐吃什么对其他生物有巨大的影响。了解这种决定背后的复杂性可能具有巨大的价值。如果我们想变得更好，我们需要更好地了解事情。

**Embracing complexity 拥抱复杂性**

Simplification is a powerful design strategy. Naturally the button to make an emergency call should be as simple as possible. And yet, we also need further design strategies that help us accept, understand, and interact with complex situations in our lives.  
简化是一种强大的设计策略。当然，拨打紧急电话的按钮应该尽可能简单。然而，我们还需要进一步的设计策略，帮助我们接受、理解生活中的复杂情况并与之互动。
