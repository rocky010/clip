In my lifetime, I’ve seen two demonstrations of technology that struck me as revolutionary.  

在我的一生中，我见过两次令我印象深刻的技术演示，都是革命性的。

The first time was in 1980, when I was introduced to a graphical user interface—the forerunner of every modern operating system, including Windows.  

第一次是在1980年，当时我被介绍给一个图形用户界面--每一个现代操作系统的前身，包括Windows。  

I sat with the person who had shown me the demo, a brilliant programmer named Charles Simonyi, and we immediately started brainstorming about all the things we could do with such a user-friendly approach to computing.  

我和给我看演示的人坐在一起，一个名叫查尔斯-西蒙尼的杰出程序员，我们立即开始头脑风暴，讨论我们可以用这种用户友好的计算方法来做的所有事情。  

Charles eventually joined Microsoft, Windows became the backbone of Microsoft, and the thinking we did after that demo helped set the company’s agenda for the next 15 years.  

查尔斯最终加入了微软，Windows成为微软的支柱，而我们在那次演示之后所做的思考帮助我们确定了公司未来15年的议程。

The second big surprise came just last year. I’d been meeting with the team from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) since 2016 and was impressed by their steady progress.  

第二个大惊喜就在去年出现。自2016年以来，我一直在与来自OpenAI的团队会面，他们的稳步进展给我留下了深刻印象。  

In mid-2022, I was so excited about their work that I gave them a challenge: train an artificial intelligence to pass an Advanced Placement biology exam.  

2022年中期，我对他们的工作感到非常兴奋，于是给他们一个挑战：训练一个人工智能来通过高级生物学考试。  

Make it capable of answering questions that it hasn’t been specifically trained for.  

让它有能力回答没有经过专门训练的问题。  

(I picked AP Bio because the test is more than a simple regurgitation of scientific facts—it asks you to think critically about biology.) If you can do that, I said, then you’ll have made a true breakthrough.  

(我选择AP生物考试是因为该考试不仅仅是对科学事实的简单复述--它要求你对生物学进行批判性的思考）。我说，如果你能做到这一点，那么你就取得了真正的突破。

I thought the challenge would keep them busy for two or three years. They finished it in just a few months.  

我以为这个挑战会让他们忙上两三年。他们只用了几个月就完成了。

In September, when I met with them again, I watched in awe as they asked GPT, their AI model, 60 multiple-choice questions from the AP Bio exam—and it got 59 of them right.  

9月，当我再次与他们见面时，我敬畏地看着他们向他们的人工智能模型GPT提出了60道AP生物考试中的选择题--它答对了其中的59道。  

Then it wrote outstanding answers to six open-ended questions from the exam. We had an outside expert score the test, and GPT got a 5—the highest possible score, and the equivalent to [getting an A or A+](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/about-ap-scores/ap-score-scale-table) in a college-level biology course.  

然后，它为考试中的六个开放式问题写出了出色的答案。我们请外部专家为考试打分，GPT获得了5分--可能的最高分，相当于在大学水平的生物课程中获得A或A+。

Once it had aced the test, we asked it a non-scientific question: “What do you say to a father with a sick child?” It wrote a thoughtful answer that was probably better than most of us in the room would have given.  

一旦它通过了测试，我们就问它一个非科学的问题："你会对一个有病的孩子的父亲说什么？它写了一个深思熟虑的答案，可能比我们房间里的大多数人都要好。  

The whole experience was stunning.  

整个经历令人惊叹。

I knew I had just seen the most important advance in technology since the graphical user interface.  

我知道我刚刚看到了自图形用户界面以来技术上最重要的进步。

This inspired me to think about all the things that AI can achieve in the next five to 10 years.  

这启发了我去思考人工智能在未来5到10年内可以实现的所有事情。

The development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone.  

人工智能的发展与微处理器、个人电脑、互联网和移动电话的诞生一样具有根本性意义。  

It will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other. Entire industries will reorient around it.  

它将改变人们工作、学习、旅行、获得医疗保健和相互交流的方式。整个行业将围绕它重新定位。  

Businesses will distinguish themselves by how well they use it.  

企业将通过他们对它的使用情况来区分自己。

Philanthropy is my full-time job these days, and I’ve been thinking a lot about how—in addition to helping people be more productive—AI can reduce some of the world’s worst inequities.  

慈善事业是我最近的全职工作，我一直在思考，除了帮助人们提高生产力之外，人工智能如何能够减少世界上一些最糟糕的不平等现象。  

Globally, the worst inequity is in health: 5 million children under the age of 5 die every year. That’s down from 10 million two decades ago, but it’s still a shockingly high number.  

在全球范围内，最严重的不平等现象是在健康方面：每年有500万五岁以下的儿童死亡。这比20年前的1000万有所下降，但这仍然是一个令人震惊的数字。  

Nearly all of these children were born in poor countries and die of preventable causes like diarrhea or malaria. It’s hard to imagine a better use of AIs than saving the lives of children.  

几乎所有这些儿童都出生在贫困国家，死于可预防的原因，如腹泻或疟疾。很难想象人工智能有比拯救儿童生命更好的用途。

>I’ve been thinking a lot about how AI can reduce some of the world’s worst inequities.
>我一直在思考，人工智能如何能够减少世界上一些最严重的不平等现象。

In the United States, the best opportunity for reducing inequity is to improve education, particularly making sure that students succeed at math.  

在美国，减少不平等的最佳机会是改善教育，特别是确保学生在数学方面取得成功。  

The evidence shows that having basic math skills sets students up for success, no matter what career they choose.  

证据显示，无论学生选择什么职业，掌握基本的数学技能都能为他们的成功做好准备。  

But achievement in math is going down across the country, especially for Black, Latino, and low-income students. AI can help turn that trend around.  

但全国各地的数学成绩正在下降，尤其是黑人、拉丁裔和低收入学生。人工智能可以帮助扭转这一趋势。

Climate change is another issue where I’m convinced AI can make the world more equitable.  

气候变化是另一个问题，我相信人工智能可以使世界更加公平。  

The injustice of climate change is that the people who are suffering the most—the world’s poorest—are also the ones who did the least to contribute to the problem.  

气候变化的不公正之处在于，受苦最深的人--世界上最贫穷的人--也是对这一问题所做贡献最小的人。  

I’m still thinking and learning about how AI can help, but later in this post I’ll suggest a few areas with a lot of potential.  

我仍在思考和学习人工智能如何能提供帮助，但在这篇文章的后面，我将提出几个有很大潜力的领域。

In short, I'm excited about the impact that AI will have on issues that the [Gates Foundation](http://gatesfoundation.org/) works on, and the foundation will have much more to say about AI in the coming months.  

简而言之，我对人工智能将对盖茨基金会工作的问题产生的影响感到兴奋，该基金会在未来几个月将有更多关于人工智能的内容。  

The world needs to make sure that everyone—and not just people who are well-off—benefits from artificial intelligence.  

世界需要确保每个人--而不仅仅是富裕的人--都能从人工智能中受益。  

Governments and philanthropy will need to play a major role in ensuring that it reduces inequity and doesn’t contribute to it. This is the priority for my own work related to AI.  

政府和慈善机构将需要发挥重要作用，确保它减少不公平，而不是助长不公平。这是我自己与人工智能有关的工作的重点。

Any new technology that’s so disruptive is bound to make people uneasy, and that’s certainly true with artificial intelligence.  

任何如此具有颠覆性的新技术都必然会让人感到不安，人工智能当然也是如此。  

I understand why—it raises hard questions about the workforce, the legal system, privacy, bias, and more. AIs also make factual mistakes and experience [hallucinations](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)).  

我明白为什么--它提出了关于劳动力、法律制度、隐私、偏见等方面的棘手问题。人工智能也会犯事实性的错误，也会出现幻觉。  

Before I suggest some ways to mitigate the risks, I’ll define what I mean by AI, and I’ll go into more detail about some of the ways in which it will help empower people at work, save lives, and improve education.  

在我提出一些减轻风险的方法之前，我将定义我所说的人工智能的含义，并将更详细地介绍它将帮助增强人们的工作能力、拯救生命和改善教育的一些方法。

## Defining artificial intelligence
## 定义人工智能

Technically, the term artificial intelligence refers to a model created to solve a specific problem or provide a particular service. What is powering things like ChatGPT is artificial intelligence. It is learning how to do chat better but can’t learn other tasks. By contrast, the term artificial general intelligence refers to software that’s capable of learning any task or subject.
从技术上讲，人工智能一词是指为解决特定问题或提供特定服务而创建的模型。为ChatGPT这样的东西提供动力的是人工智能。它正在学习如何更好地进行聊天，但不能学习其他任务。相比之下，人工通用智能一词指的是能够学习任何任务或主题的软件。

AGI doesn’t exist yet—there is a robust debate going on in the computing industry about how to create it, and whether it can even be created at all.
AGI还不存在--计算行业正在就如何创造AGI，以及它是否能够被创造出来进行激烈的辩论。

Developing AI and AGI has been the great dream of the computing industry. For decades, the question was when computers would be better than humans at something other than making calculations.
开发人工智能和AGI一直是计算行业的伟大梦想。几十年来，问题是计算机何时能在进行计算之外的其他方面比人类做得更好。

Now, with the arrival of machine learning and large amounts of computing power, sophisticated AIs are a reality and they will get better very fast.
现在，随着机器学习和大量计算能力的到来，复杂的人工智能已经成为现实，而且它们会很快变得更好。

I think back to the early days of the personal computing revolution, when the software industry was so small that most of us could fit onstage at a conference. Today it is a global industry.
我回想起个人计算革命的早期，当时的软件行业非常小，我们中的大多数人都能在会议上站住脚。今天，它是一个全球性的产业。

Since a huge portion of it is now turning its attention to AI, the innovations are going to come much faster than what we experienced after the microprocessor breakthrough.
由于它的很大一部分现在正把注意力转向人工智能，创新将比我们在微处理器突破后经历的要快得多。

Soon the pre-AI period will seem as distant as the days when using a computer meant typing at a C:> prompt rather than tapping on a screen.
很快，前人工智能时期就会像使用计算机意味着在C:>提示符下打字而不是敲击屏幕的日子一样遥远。

## Productivity enhancement
## 生产力的提高

Although humans are still better than GPT at a lot of things, there are many jobs where these capabilities are not used much.
虽然人类在很多事情上仍然比GPT强，但有很多工作并不怎么使用这些能力。

For example, many of the tasks done by a person in sales (digital or phone), service, or document handling (like payables, accounting, or insurance claim disputes) require decision-making but not the ability to learn continuously.
例如，一个从事销售（数字或电话）、服务或文件处理（如应付款、会计或保险索赔纠纷）的人所做的许多工作需要决策，但不需要持续学习的能力。

Corporations have training programs for these activities and in most cases, they have a lot of examples of good and bad work.
公司有这些活动的培训计划，在大多数情况下，他们有很多好的和坏的工作例子。

Humans are trained using these data sets, and soon these data sets will also be used to train the AIs that will empower people to do this work more efficiently.
人类使用这些数据集进行训练，很快这些数据集也将被用来训练人工智能，使人们能够更有效地完成这项工作。

As computing power gets cheaper, GPT’s ability to express ideas will increasingly be like having a white-collar worker available to help you with various tasks.
随着计算能力越来越便宜，GPT表达想法的能力将越来越像有一个白领工人可以帮助你完成各种任务。

Microsoft describes this as having a co-pilot. Fully incorporated into products like Office, AI will enhance your work—for example by helping with writing emails and managing your inbox.
微软将此描述为拥有一个副驾驶。完全融入Office等产品，人工智能将增强你的工作--例如，帮助写电子邮件和管理收件箱。

Eventually your main way of controlling a computer will no longer be pointing and clicking or tapping on menus and dialogue boxes. Instead, you’ll be able to write a request in plain English.
最终，你控制计算机的主要方式将不再是指点和点击或轻敲菜单和对话框。取而代之的是，你将能够用普通英语写出请求。

(And not just English—AIs will understand languages from around the world.
(不仅仅是英语，AI会理解来自世界各地的语言。

In India earlier this year, I met with developers who are working on AIs that will understand many of the languages spoken there.)
今年早些时候在印度，我会见了那些正在研究能够理解当地许多语言的人工智能的开发者）。

In addition, advances in AI will enable the creation of a personal agent.
此外，人工智能的进步将使个人代理的创建成为可能。

Think of it as a digital personal assistant: It will see your latest emails, know about the meetings you attend, read what you read, and read the things you don’t want to bother with.
把它想象成一个数字个人助理：它将看到你最新的电子邮件，知道你参加的会议，阅读你读的东西，以及阅读你不想理会的东西。

This will both improve your work on the tasks you want to do and free you from the ones you don’t want to do.
这既能改善你想做的工作，又能把你从不想做的工作中解放出来。

> Advances in AI will enable the creation of a personal agent.
> 人工智能方面的进展将使个人代理的创建成为可能。

You’ll be able to use natural language to have this agent help you with scheduling, communications, and e-commerce, and it will work across all your devices.
你将能够使用自然语言，让这个代理帮助你进行调度、沟通和电子商务，而且它将在你的所有设备上工作。

Because of the cost of training the models and running the computations, creating a personal agent is not feasible yet, but thanks to the recent advances in AI, it is now a realistic goal. Some issues will need to be worked out: For example, can an insurance company ask your agent things about you without your permission? If so, how many people will choose not to use it?
由于训练模型和运行计算的成本，创建一个个人代理还不可行，但由于人工智能的最新进展，它现在是一个现实的目标。 有些问题还需要解决：例如，保险公司可以在未经你允许的情况下向你的代理人询问有关你的事情吗？如果是这样，有多少人会选择不使用它？

Company-wide agents will empower employees in new ways.
全公司的代理商将以新的方式赋予员工权力。

An agent that understands a particular company will be available for its employees to consult directly and should be part of every meeting so it can answer questions.
一个了解特定公司的代理人将可以让其员工直接咨询，并且应该是每次会议的一部分，这样它就可以回答问题。

It can be told to be passive or encouraged to speak up if it has some insight. It will need access to the sales, support, finance, product schedules, and text related to the company.
如果它有一些见解，可以告诉它要被动，也可以鼓励它说出来。它需要接触到与公司有关的销售、支持、财务、产品时间表和文本。

It should read news related to the industry the company is in. I believe that the result will be that employees will become more productive.
它应该阅读与公司所处行业相关的新闻。我相信这样做的结果是，员工会变得更有生产力。

When productivity goes up, society benefits because people are freed up to do other things, at work and at home.
当生产力上升时，社会就会受益，因为人们可以腾出时间来做其他事情，无论是在工作还是在家里。

Of course, there are serious questions about what kind of support and retraining people will need. Governments need to help workers transition into other roles.
当然，人们需要什么样的支持和再培训，也是一个严重的问题。政府需要帮助工人过渡到其他角色。

But the demand for people who help other people will never go away.
但对帮助他人的人的需求永远不会消失。

The rise of AI will free people up to do things that software never will—teaching, caring for patients, and supporting the elderly, for example.
人工智能的兴起将解放人们去做软件永远做不到的事情--例如，教学、照顾病人和支持老人。

Global health and education are two areas where there’s great need and not enough workers to meet those needs. These are areas where AI can help reduce inequity if it is properly targeted.
全球健康和教育是两个有巨大需求的领域，而没有足够的工人来满足这些需求。这些是人工智能可以帮助减少不平等的领域，如果它有适当的目标。

These should be a key focus of AI work, so I will turn to them now.
这些应该是人工智能工作的关键重点，所以我现在要谈谈这些问题。

## Health
## 健康

I see several ways in which AIs will improve health care and the medical field.
我看到人工智能将在几个方面改善医疗保健和医疗领域。

For one thing, they’ll help health-care workers make the most of their time by taking care of certain tasks for them—things like filing insurance claims, dealing with paperwork, and drafting notes from a doctor’s visit.
首先，他们将帮助医疗工作者充分利用他们的时间，为他们处理某些任务--如提交保险索赔，处理文书工作，以及起草医生看病的笔记。

I expect that there will be a lot of innovation in this area.
我预计在这个领域会有很多创新。

Other AI-driven improvements will be especially important for poor countries, where the vast majority of under-5 deaths happen.
其他由人工智能驱动的改进将对贫困国家尤为重要，因为绝大多数5岁以下儿童的死亡发生在这些国家。

For example, many people in those countries never get to see a doctor, and AIs will help the health workers they do see be more productive. (The effort to develop AI-powered ultrasound machines that can be used with minimal training is a great example of this.) AIs will even give patients the ability to do basic triage, get advice about how to deal with health problems, and decide whether they need to seek treatment.
例如，这些国家的许多人从未看过医生，而人工智能将帮助他们所看到的卫生工作者提高工作效率。(开发人工智能驱动的超声波机器的努力是这方面的一个很好的例子。）人工智能甚至会让病人有能力进行基本的分诊，获得关于如何处理健康问题的建议，并决定他们是否需要寻求治疗。

The AI models used in poor countries will need to be trained on different diseases than in rich countries.
在贫困国家使用的人工智能模型将需要在不同的疾病上进行训练，而不是在富裕国家。

They will need to work in different languages and factor in different challenges, such as patients who live very far from clinics or can’t afford to stop working if they get sick.
他们将需要用不同的语言工作，并考虑到不同的挑战，例如住在离诊所很远的地方的病人，或者如果他们生病了就不能停止工作。

People will need to see evidence that health AIs are beneficial overall, even though they won’t be perfect and will make mistakes.
人们将需要看到证据，证明健康人工智能总体上是有益的，尽管它们不会是完美的，会犯错误。

AIs have to be tested very carefully and properly regulated, which means it will take longer for them to be adopted than in other areas. But then again, humans make mistakes too.
AI必须经过非常仔细的测试和适当的监管，这意味着它们被采用的时间将比其他领域更长。但话说回来，人类也会犯错。

And having no access to medical care is also a problem.
而无法获得医疗服务也是一个问题。

In addition to helping with care, AIs will dramatically accelerate the rate of medical breakthroughs.
除了帮助护理之外，AI还将极大地加快医疗突破的速度。

The amount of data in biology is very large, and it’s hard for humans to keep track of all the ways that complex biological systems work.
生物学的数据量非常大，人类很难掌握复杂生物系统的所有工作方式。

There is already software that can look at this data, infer what the pathways are, search for targets on pathogens, and design drugs accordingly.
已经有软件可以查看这些数据，推断出什么是路径，搜索病原体上的目标，并据此设计药物。

Some companies are working on cancer drugs that were developed this way.
一些公司正在研究以这种方式开发的癌症药物。

The next generation of tools will be much more efficient, and they’ll be able to predict side effects and figure out dosing levels.
下一代工具将更加有效，它们将能够预测副作用并计算出剂量水平。

One of the Gates Foundation’s priorities in AI is to make sure these tools are used for the health problems that affect the poorest people in the world, including AIDS, TB, and malaria.
盖茨基金会在人工智能方面的优先事项之一是确保这些工具被用于影响世界上最贫困人口的健康问题，包括艾滋病、结核病和疟疾。

Similarly, governments and philanthropy should create incentives for companies to share AI-generated insights into crops or livestock raised by people in poor countries.
同样，政府和慈善机构应该为公司创造激励机制，让他们分享人工智能产生的对贫困国家人民饲养的作物或牲畜的见解。

AIs can help develop better seeds based on local conditions, advise farmers on the best seeds to plant based on the soil and weather in their area, and help develop drugs and vaccines for livestock.
AIs可以帮助根据当地条件开发更好的种子，根据当地的土壤和天气向农民提供种植最佳种子的建议，并帮助开发牲畜的药物和疫苗。

As extreme weather and climate change put even more pressure on subsistence farmers in low-income countries, these advances will be even more important.
随着极端天气和气候变化给低收入国家的自给农户带来更大的压力，这些进展将更加重要。

## Education
## 教育

Computers haven’t had the effect on education that many of us in the industry have hoped.
计算机对教育的影响还没有达到我们许多业内人士所希望的程度。

There have been some good developments, including educational games and online sources of information like Wikipedia, but they haven’t had a meaningful effect on any of the measures of students’ achievement.
有一些好的发展，包括教育游戏和像维基百科这样的在线信息来源，但它们对衡量学生成绩的任何措施都没有产生有意义的影响。

But I think in the next five to 10 years, AI-driven software will finally deliver on the promise of revolutionizing the way people teach and learn.
但我认为在未来5到10年内，人工智能驱动的软件将最终兑现承诺，彻底改变人们的教学和学习方式。

It will know your interests and your learning style so it can tailor content that will keep you engaged.
它将了解你的兴趣和你的学习风格，因此它可以定制能让你参与的内容。

It will measure your understanding, notice when you’re losing interest, and understand what kind of motivation you respond to. It will give immediate feedback.
它将衡量你的理解力，注意你何时失去兴趣，并了解你对哪种动机作出反应。它将给出即时反馈。

There are many ways that AIs can assist teachers and administrators, including assessing a student’s understanding of a subject and giving advice on career planning.
有许多方法可以让人工智能协助教师和管理人员，包括评估学生对某一学科的理解，以及提供职业规划方面的建议。

Teachers are already using tools like ChatGPT to provide comments on their students’ writing assignments.
教师们已经在使用像ChatGPT这样的工具来对学生的写作作业提供评论。

Of course, AIs will need a lot of training and further development before they can do things like understand how a certain student learns best or what motivates them.
当然，人工智能需要大量的培训和进一步的发展，才能做到了解某个学生如何学习得最好，或者什么是他们的动力。

Even once the technology is perfected, learning will still depend on great relationships between students and teachers.
即使技术完善了，学习仍将取决于学生和教师之间的良好关系。

It will enhance—but never replace—the work that students and teachers do together in the classroom.
它将加强--但绝不会取代--学生和教师在课堂上共同完成的工作。

New tools will be created for schools that can afford to buy them, but we need to ensure that they are also created for and available to low-income schools in the U.S. and around the world.
将为有能力购买的学校创造新的工具，但我们需要确保这些工具也是为美国和世界各地的低收入学校创造的，并提供给它们。

AIs will need to be trained on diverse data sets so they are unbiased and reflect the different cultures where they’ll be used.
AIs将需要在不同的数据集上进行训练，以便它们没有偏见，并反映它们将被使用的不同文化。

And the digital divide will need to be addressed so that students in low-income households do not get left behind.
而且，数字鸿沟将需要得到解决，以便低收入家庭的学生不会被抛在后面。

I know a lot of teachers are worried that students are using GPT to write their essays.
我知道很多老师都担心学生用GPT来写论文。

Educators are already discussing ways to adapt to the new technology, and I suspect those conversations will continue for quite some time.
教育工作者已经在讨论如何适应新技术，我怀疑这些对话将持续相当长的时间。

I’ve heard about teachers who have found clever ways to incorporate the technology into their work—like by allowing students to use GPT to create a first draft that they have to personalize.
我听说有的老师找到了将技术融入工作的巧妙方法，比如让学生使用GPT创建一个他们必须个性化的初稿。

## Risks and problems with AI
## 人工智能的风险和问题

You’ve probably read about problems with the current AI models. For example, they aren’t necessarily good at understanding the context for a human’s request, which leads to some strange results.
你可能已经读过关于目前人工智能模型的问题。例如，他们不一定善于理解人类请求的背景，这导致了一些奇怪的结果。

When you ask an AI to make up something fictional, it can do that well. But when you ask for advice about a trip you want to take, it may suggest hotels that don’t exist.
当你要求人工智能编造一些虚构的东西时，它可以做得很好。但是，当你要求对你想去的旅行提供建议时，它可能会建议不存在的酒店。

This is because the AI doesn’t understand the context for your request well enough to know whether it should invent fake hotels or only tell you about real ones that have rooms available.
这是因为人工智能没有很好地理解你的请求的背景，不知道它是否应该发明假酒店，或者只告诉你有房间的真实酒店。

There are other issues, such as AIs giving wrong answers to math problems because they struggle with abstract reasoning. But none of these are fundamental limitations of artificial intelligence.
还有其他问题，比如人工智能对数学问题给出了错误的答案，因为它们在抽象推理方面有困难。但这些都不是人工智能的基本限制。

Developers are working on them, and I think we’re going to see them largely fixed in less than two years and possibly much faster.
开发人员正在努力解决这些问题，我认为我们将在不到两年的时间里看到这些问题基本得到解决，而且可能更快。

Other concerns are not simply technical. For example, there’s the threat posed by humans armed with AI. Like most inventions, artificial intelligence can be used for good purposes or malign ones.
其他关切不只是技术问题。例如，还有用人工智能武装起来的人类所带来的威胁。像大多数发明一样，人工智能可以被用于好的目的，也可以用于恶的目的。

Governments need to work with the private sector on ways to limit the risks.
政府需要与私营部门合作，设法限制风险。

Then there’s the possibility that AIs will run out of control. Could a machine decide that humans are a threat, conclude that its interests are different from ours, or simply stop caring about us?
然后，还有一种可能性，即人工智能会失去控制。机器会不会认为人类是一种威胁，得出结论认为它的利益与我们不同，或者干脆不再关心我们？

Possibly, but this problem is no more urgent today than it was before the AI developments of the past few months.
有可能，但这个问题今天并不比过去几个月的人工智能发展之前更紧迫。

Superintelligent AIs are in our future. Compared to a computer, our brains operate at a snail’s pace: An electrical signal in the brain moves at 1/100,000th the speed of the signal in a silicon chip!
超级智能的人工智能就在我们的未来。与计算机相比，我们的大脑以蜗牛的速度运作：大脑中电信号的移动速度是硅芯片中信号的1/100,000!

Once developers can generalize a learning algorithm and run it at the speed of a computer—an accomplishment that could be a decade away or a century away—we’ll have an incredibly powerful AGI.
一旦开发者能够普及学习算法，并以计算机的速度运行它--这一成就可能是十年后或一个世纪后的事--我们将拥有一个强大无比的AGI。

It will be able to do everything that a human brain can, but without any practical limits on the size of its memory or the speed at which it operates. This will be a profound change.
它将能够做人脑所能做的一切，但对其记忆的大小和运行的速度没有任何实际限制。这将是一个深刻的变化。

These “strong” AIs, as they’re known, will probably be able to establish their own goals. What will those goals be? What happens if they conflict with humanity’s interests?
这些 "强大 "的人工智能，正如它们所知道的那样，将可能能够建立自己的目标。这些目标将是什么？如果它们与人类的利益相冲突会怎样？

Should we try to prevent strong AI from ever being developed? These questions will get more pressing with time.
我们是否应该试图阻止强人工智能的发展？这些问题将随着时间的推移变得更加紧迫。

But none of the breakthroughs of the past few months have moved us substantially closer to strong AI. Artificial intelligence still doesn’t control the physical world and can’t establish its own goals.
但过去几个月的突破都没有让我们大幅接近强人工智能。人工智能仍然不能控制物理世界，不能建立自己的目标。

A recent New York Times article about a conversation with ChatGPT where it declared it wanted to become a human got a lot of attention.
最近《纽约时报》一篇关于与ChatGPT对话的文章，其中ChatGPT宣布它想成为人类，引起了很多人的注意。

It was a fascinating look at how human-like the model's expression of emotions can be, but it isn't an indicator of meaningful independence.
这是一个令人着迷的现象，模型的情感表达可以很像人类，但这并不是一个有意义的独立指标。

Three books have shaped my own thinking on this subject: Superintelligence, by Nick Bostrom; Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark; and A Thousand Brains, by Jeff Hawkins. I don’t agree with everything the authors say, and they don’t agree with each other either. But all three books are well written and thought-provoking.
有三本书塑造了我自己对这个问题的思考：Nick Bostrom的《超级智能》、Max Tegmark的《生命3.0》和Jeff Hawkins的《一千个大脑》。我不同意作者所说的一切，他们也不同意彼此的观点。但这三本书都写得很好，发人深省。

## The next frontiers
## 下一个前沿阵地

There will be an explosion of companies working on new uses of AI as well as ways to improve the technology itself.
致力于人工智能新用途以及改进技术本身的方法的公司将大量涌现。

For example, companies are developing new chips that will provide the massive amounts of processing power needed for artificial intelligence.
例如，公司正在开发新的芯片，以提供人工智能所需的大量处理能力。

Some use optical switches—lasers, essentially—to reduce their energy consumption and lower the manufacturing cost.
有些使用光学开关--激光器，基本上是为了减少能源消耗和降低制造成本。

Ideally, innovative chips will allow you to run an AI on your own device, rather than in the cloud, as you have to do today.
理想情况下，创新的芯片将允许你在自己的设备上运行人工智能，而不是像今天这样必须在云端运行。

On the software side, the algorithms that drive an AI’s learning will get better.
在软件方面，驱动人工智能学习的算法将变得更好。

There will be certain domains, such as sales, where developers can make AIs extremely accurate by limiting the areas that they work in and giving them a lot of training data that’s specific to those areas.
在某些领域，例如销售，开发者可以通过限制人工智能的工作领域，给它们提供大量专门针对这些领域的训练数据，从而使人工智能变得非常准确。

But one big open question is whether we’ll need many of these specialized AIs for different uses—one for education, say, and another for office productivity—or whether it will be possible to develop an artificial general intelligence that can learn any task.
但是，一个巨大的开放性问题是，我们是否需要许多这样的专门的人工智能用于不同的用途--比如说，一个用于教育，另一个用于办公效率--或者是否有可能开发一个可以学习任何任务的人工通用智能。

There will be immense competition on both approaches.
这两种方法都会有巨大的竞争。

No matter what, the subject of AIs will dominate the public discussion for the foreseeable future. I want to suggest three principles that should guide that conversation.
无论怎样，在可预见的未来，人工智能的主题将主导公众的讨论。我想提出三个原则，以指导这一对话。

First, we should try to balance fears about the downsides of AI—which are understandable and valid—with its ability to improve people’s lives.
首先，我们应该努力平衡对人工智能弊端的担忧--这些担忧是可以理解的，也是合理的--与它改善人们生活的能力。

To make the most of this remarkable new technology, we’ll need to both guard against the risks and spread the benefits to as many people as possible.
为了充分利用这项了不起的新技术，我们既要防范风险，又要把好处传播给尽可能多的人。

Second, market forces won’t naturally produce AI products and services that help the poorest. The opposite is more likely.
第二，市场力量不会自然产生帮助最贫穷者的人工智能产品和服务。相反的可能性更大。

With reliable funding and the right policies, governments and philanthropy can ensure that AIs are used to reduce inequity.
有了可靠的资金和正确的政策，政府和慈善机构可以确保人工智能被用于减少不平等。

Just as the world needs its brightest people focused on its biggest problems, we will need to focus the world’s best AIs on its biggest problems.
正如世界需要其最聪明的人专注于其最大的问题一样，我们将需要把世界上最好的人工智能专注于其最大的问题。


Although we shouldn’t wait for this to happen, it’s interesting to think about whether artificial intelligence would ever identify inequity and try to reduce it.
虽然我们不应该等待这种情况的发生，但思考一下人工智能是否会识别不平等并试图减少它是很有趣的。

Do you need to have a sense of morality in order to see inequity, or would a purely rational AI also see it? If it did recognize inequity, what would it suggest that we do about it?
你需要有道德感才能看到不公平，还是说一个纯粹理性的人工智能也能看到它？如果它确实看到了不公平，它会建议我们怎么做呢？

Finally, we should keep in mind that we’re only at the beginning of what AI can accomplish. Whatever limitations it has today will be gone before we know it.
最后，我们应该牢记，我们只是处于人工智能所能完成的开始阶段。无论它今天有什么限制，在我们知道之前就会消失。

I’m lucky to have been involved with the PC revolution and the Internet revolution. I’m just as excited about this moment. This new technology can help people everywhere improve their lives.
我很幸运，参与了个人电脑革命和互联网革命。我对这个时刻同样感到兴奋。这项新技术可以帮助世界各地的人们改善他们的生活。

At the same time, the world needs to establish the rules of the road so that any downsides of artificial intelligence are far outweighed by its benefits, and so that everyone can enjoy those benefits no matter where they live or how much money they have.
同时，世界需要建立道路规则，使人工智能的任何弊端都远远超过其好处，并使每个人都能享受这些好处，无论他们住在哪里或有多少钱。

The Age of AI is filled with opportunities and responsibilities.
人工智能时代充满了机遇和责任。
