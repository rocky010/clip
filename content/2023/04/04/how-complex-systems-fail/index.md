-   ## [Complex systems are intrinsically hazardous systems.  
    
    复杂的系统是内在的危险系统。](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#1)
    
    All of the interesting systems (e.g. transportation, healthcare, power generation) are inherently and unavoidably hazardous by the own nature.  
    
    所有有趣的系统（如交通、医疗、发电）都因其本身的性质而具有内在的、不可避免的危险性。  
    
    The frequency of hazard exposure can sometimes be changed but the processes involved in the system are themselves intrinsically and irreducibly hazardous.  
    
    危险暴露的频率有时可以改变，但系统所涉及的过程本身就是内在的、不可减少的危险。  
    
    It is the presence of these hazards that drives the creation of defenses against hazard that characterize these systems.  
    
    正是这些危险的存在，推动了对危险的防御措施的产生，而这正是这些系统的特点。
    
-   ## [Complex systems are heavily and successfully defended against failure  
    
    复杂的系统被大量地、成功地抵御了故障](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#2)
    
    The high consequences of failure lead over time to the construction of multiple layers of defense against failure.  
    
    失败的高后果随着时间的推移导致了对失败的多层防御的构建。  
    
    These defenses include obvious technical components (e.g. backup systems, ‘safety’ features of equipment) and human components (e.g.  
    
    这些防御措施包括明显的技术成分（如备份系统、设备的 "安全 "功能）和人类成分（如  
    
    training, knowledge) but also a variety of organizational, institutional, and regulatory defenses (e.g. policies and procedures, certification, work rules, team training).  
    
    培训、知识），但也有各种组织、机构和法规的防御（如政策和程序、认证、工作规则、团队培训）。
    
    The effect of these measures is to provide a series of shields that normally divert operations away from accidents.  
    
    这些措施的效果是提供了一系列的防护措施，这些措施通常会将业务从事故中转移出来。
    
-   ## [Catastrophe requires multiple failures – single point failures are not enough.  
    
    灾难需要多种故障--单点故障是不够的。](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#3)
    
    The array of defenses works. System operations are generally successful.  
    
    一系列的防御措施发挥作用。系统运行总体上是成功的。  
    
    Overt catastrophic failure occurs when small, apparently innocuous failures join to create opportunity for a systemic accident. Each of these small failures is necessary to cause catastrophe but only the combination is sufficient to permit failure.  
    
    公开的灾难性失败发生在小的、表面上无害的失败联合起来为系统性事故创造机会的时候。这些小故障中的每一个都是导致灾难的必要条件，但只有组合起来才足以允许失败。  
    
    Put another way, there are many more failure opportunities than overt system accidents. Most initial failure trajectories are blocked by designed system safety components.  
    
    换句话说，故障机会比公开的系统事故多得多。大多数初始故障轨迹被设计好的系统安全部件所阻挡。
    
    Trajectories that reach the operational level are mostly blocked, usually by practitioners.  
    
    到达操作层面的轨迹大多被阻断，通常是由实践者来完成。
    
-   ## [Complex systems contain changing mixtures of failures latent within them.  
    
    复杂的系统包含潜藏在其中的不断变化的故障混合物。](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#4)
    
    The complexity of these systems makes it impossible for them to run without multiple flaws being present.  
    
    这些系统的复杂性使得它们不可能在不存在多种缺陷的情况下运行。  
    
    Because these are individually insufficient to cause failure they are regarded as minor factors during operations.  
    
    因为这些都是单独不足以导致故障的因素，它们被认为是操作过程中的次要因素。  
    
    Eradication of all latent failures is limited primarily by economic cost but also because it is difficult before the fact to see how such failures might contribute to an accident.  
    
    消除所有的潜伏故障主要受到经济成本的限制，但也因为在事实之前很难看到这些故障可能导致事故的发生。  
    
    The failures change constantly because of changing technology, work organization, and efforts to eradicate failures.  
    
    由于技术、工作组织的变化，以及消除故障的努力，故障不断变化。
    
-   ## [Complex systems run in degraded mode.  
    
    复杂的系统以降级模式运行。](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#5)
    
    A corollary to the preceding point is that complex systems run as broken systems. The system continues to function because it contains so many redundancies and because people can make it function, despite the presence of many flaws.  
    
    前述观点的一个推论是，复杂的系统是作为破碎的系统运行的。系统继续运行是因为它包含了许多冗余，而且人们可以使它运行，尽管存在许多缺陷。  
    
    After accident reviews nearly always note that the system has a history of prior ‘proto-accidents’ that nearly generated catastrophe.  
    
    事故后的审查几乎总是注意到，该系统有一个先前的 "原事故 "历史，几乎产生了灾难。  
    
    Arguments that these degraded conditions should have been recognized before the overt accident are usually predicated on naïve notions of system performance.  
    
    认为这些退化的条件在公开的事故之前就应该被认识到的论点，通常是以天真的系统性能概念为前提的。  
    
    System operations are dynamic, with components (organizational, human, technical) failing and being replaced continuously.  
    
    系统运行是动态的，各组成部分（组织、人力、技术）不断地失效和被替换。
    
-   ## [Catastrophe is always just around the corner.  
    
    灾难总是在拐角处。](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#6)
    
    Complex systems possess potential for catastrophic failure.  
    
    复杂的系统拥有潜在的灾难性故障。  
    
    Human practitioners are nearly always in close physical and temporal proximity to these potential failures – disaster can occur at any time and in nearly any place.  
    
    人类从业者几乎总是在物理和时间上接近这些潜在的故障--灾难可能在任何时间和任何地点发生。  
    
    The potential for catastrophic outcome is a hallmark of complex systems. It is impossible to eliminate the potential for such catastrophic failure; the potential for such failure is always present by the system’s own nature.  
    
    潜在的灾难性结果是复杂系统的一个标志。要消除这种灾难性失败的可能性是不可能的；系统本身的性质决定了这种失败的可能性始终存在。
    
-   ## [Post-accident attribution to a ‘root cause’ is fundamentally wrong.  
    
    事故后归因于 "根本原因 "从根本上说是错误的。](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#7)
    
    Because overt failure requires multiple faults, there is no isolated ‘cause’ of an accident.  
    
    因为公开的故障需要多个故障，所以不存在孤立的事故'原因'。  
    
    There are multiple contributors to accidents. Each of these is necessarily insufficient in itself to create an accident.  
    
    事故的发生有多种因素。其中每个因素本身必然不足以造成事故。  
    
    Only jointly are these causes sufficient to create an accident. Indeed, it is the linking of these causes together that creates the circumstances required for the accident.  
    
    只有这些原因联合起来，才足以造成事故。事实上，正是这些原因联系在一起才创造了事故所需的环境。  
    
    Thus, no isolation of the ‘root cause’ of an accident is possible.  
    
    因此，不可能将事故的 "根源 "分离出来。  
    
    The evaluations based on such reasoning as ‘root cause’ do not reflect a technical understanding of the nature of failure but rather the social, cultural need to blame specific, localized forces or events for outcomes. [<sup>1</sup>](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#footnote-1)  
    
    基于 "根本原因 "这种推理的评价，并不反映对失败性质的技术理解，而是反映了将结果归咎于特定的、局部的力量或事件的社会、文化需要。 <sup>1</sup>
    
    [<sup>1</sup>](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#7) Anthropological field research provides the clearest demonstration of the social construction of the notion of ‘cause’ (cf.  
    
    <sup>1</sup> 人类学的实地研究为 "原因 "这一概念的社会建构提供了最清晰的证明（参见。

-   ## [Hindsight biases post-accident assessments of human performance.  
    
    事后诸葛亮对人的表现的评估有偏差。](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#8)
    
    Knowledge of the outcome makes it seem that events leading to the outcome should have appeared more salient to practitioners at the time than was actually the case. This means that _ex post facto_ accident analysis of human performance is inaccurate.  
    
    对结果的了解使人觉得，导致结果的事件在当时对从业者来说应该比实际情况更突出。这意味着，对人类表现的事后事故分析是不准确的。  
    
    The outcome knowledge poisons the ability of after-accident observers to recreate the view of practitioners before the accident of those same factors.  
    
    结果知识毒害了事故后的观察者重现事故前从业者对这些相同因素的看法的能力。  
    
    It seems that practitioners “should have known” that the factors would “inevitably” lead to an accident. [<sup>2</sup>](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#footnote-2) _Hindsight bias remains the primary obstacle to accident investigation, especially when expert human performance is involved._  
    
    似乎从业者 "应该知道 "这些因素会 "不可避免地 "导致事故的发生。 <sup>2</sup> 事后诸葛亮的偏见仍然是事故调查的主要障碍，特别是当涉及到专家的人类表现时。
    
    [<sup>2</sup>](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#8) This is not a feature of medical judgements or technical ones, but rather of all human cognition about past events and their causes.  
    
    <sup>2</sup> 这不是医学判断或技术判断的特点，而是所有人类对过去事件及其原因的认知的特点。
    
-   ## [Human operators have dual roles: as producers & as defenders against failure.  
    
    人类操作者有双重角色：既是生产者，又是失败的防御者。](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#9)
    
    The system practitioners operate the system in order to produce its desired product and also work to forestall accidents.  
    
    该系统的从业人员操作该系统，以生产其期望的产品，并努力防止事故发生。  
    
    This dynamic quality of system operation, the balancing of demands for production against the possibility of incipient failure is unavoidable.  
    
    系统运行的这种动态质量，平衡对生产的需求和初生故障的可能性是不可避免的。  
    
    Outsiders rarely acknowledge the duality of this role. In non-accident filled times, the production role is emphasized.  
    
    外人很少承认这一角色的双重性。在非事故多发期，生产角色被强调。  
    
    After accidents, the defense against failure role is emphasized.  
    
    事故发生后，强调防御失败的作用。  
    
    At either time, the outsider’s view misapprehends the operator’s constant, simultaneous engagement with both roles.  
    
    在任何时候，局外人的观点都会误解操作者不断地、同时地参与两种角色。
    
-   ## [All practitioner actions are gambles.  
    
    所有从业人员的行动都是赌博。](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#10)
    
    After accidents, the overt failure often appears to have been inevitable and the practitioner’s actions as blunders or deliberate willful disregard of certain impending failure.  
    
    事故发生后，公开的失败往往看起来是不可避免的，而从业者的行为是失误或故意无视某些即将发生的失败。  
    
    But all practitioner actions are actually gambles, that is, acts that take place in the face of uncertain outcomes.  
    
    但所有从业者的行为实际上都是赌博，也就是说，在面对不确定结果时发生的行为。  
    
    The degree of uncertainty may change from moment to moment.  
    
    不确定性的程度可能会在不同的时刻发生变化。  
    
    That practitioner actions are gambles appears clear after accidents; in general, _post hoc_ analysis regards these gambles as poor ones. But the converse: that successful outcomes are also the result of gambles; is not widely appreciated.  
    
    事故发生后，实践者的行为是一种赌博，这一点显得很清楚；一般来说，事后分析认为这些赌博是很差的赌博。但反过来说，成功的结果也是赌博的结果，这一点没有得到广泛重视。
    
-   ## [Actions at the sharp end resolve all ambiguity.  
    
    锋芒毕露的行动解决了所有模糊不清的问题。](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#11)
    
    Organizations are ambiguous, often intentionally, about the relationship between production targets, efficient use of resources, economy and costs of operations, and acceptable risks of low and high consequence accidents.  
    
    组织对生产目标、资源的有效利用、运营的经济性和成本以及可接受的低和高后果的事故风险之间的关系含糊不清，往往是有意为之。  
    
    All ambiguity is resolved by actions of practitioners at the sharp end of the system.  
    
    所有模棱两可的问题都是由处于系统尖端的从业者的行动来解决的。  
    
    After an accident, practitioner actions may be regarded as ‘errors’ or ‘violations’ but these evaluations are heavily biased by hindsight and ignore the other driving forces, especially production pressure.  
    
    事故发生后，从业人员的行为可能被认为是 "错误 "或 "违规"，但这些评价严重偏离了事后的看法，忽略了其他驱动力，特别是生产压力。
    
-   ## [Human practitioners are the adaptable element of complex systems.  
    
    人类从业者是复杂系统的适应性元素。](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#12)
    
    Practitioners and first line management actively adapt the system to maximize production and minimize accidents.  
    
    从业人员和一线管理人员积极调整系统，使生产最大化，事故最小化。  
    
    These adaptations often occur on a moment by moment basis.  
    
    这些适应往往发生在每时每刻的基础上。  
    
    Some of these adaptations include: (1) Restructuring the system in order to reduce exposure of vulnerable parts to failure.  
    
    其中一些适应措施包括(1) 重组系统，以减少脆弱部分的故障暴露。  
    
    (2) Concentrating critical resources in areas of expected high demand. (3) Providing pathways for retreat or recovery from expected and unexpected faults.  
    
    (2) 将关键资源集中在预期的高需求地区。(3) 提供从预期和意外故障中撤退或恢复的途径。  
    
    (4) Establishing means for early detection of changed system performance in order to allow graceful cutbacks in production or other means of increasing resiliency.  
    
    (4) 建立早期检测系统性能变化的手段，以允许优雅地削减生产或其他提高弹性的手段。
    
-   ## [Human expertise in complex systems is constantly changing  
    
    复杂系统中人的专业知识是不断变化的](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#13)
    
    Complex systems require substantial human expertise in their operation and management.  
    
    复杂的系统在运行和管理中需要大量的人类专业知识。  
    
    This expertise changes in character as technology changes but it also changes because of the need to replace experts who leave.  
    
    这种专业知识的特点随着技术的变化而变化，但它也因为需要取代离开的专家而变化。  
    
    In every case, training and refinement of skill and expertise is one part of the function of the system itself.  
    
    在每一种情况下，技能和专业知识的培训和完善是系统本身功能的一个部分。  
    
    At any moment, therefore, a given complex system will contain practitioners and trainees with varying degrees of expertise.  
    
    因此，在任何时候，一个特定的复杂系统将包含具有不同程度专业知识的从业者和受训者。  
    
    Critical issues related to expertise arise from (1) the need to use scarce expertise as a resource for the most difficult or demanding production needs and (2) the need to develop expertise for future use.  
    
    与专业知识有关的关键问题来自于：（1）需要将稀缺的专业知识作为资源，用于最困难或最苛刻的生产需求；（2）需要发展专业知识供未来使用。
    
-   ## [Change introduces new forms of failure.  
    
    变化引入了新的失败形式。](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#14)
    
    The low rate of overt accidents in reliable systems may encourage changes, especially the use of new technology, to decrease the number of low consequence but high frequency failures.  
    
    可靠系统中的低公开事故率可能会鼓励改变，特别是使用新技术，以减少低后果但高频率的故障数量。  
    
    These changes maybe actually create opportunities for new, low frequency but high consequence failures.  
    
    这些变化可能实际上为新的、低频率但高后果的故障创造了机会。  
    
    When new technologies are used to eliminate well understood system failures or to gain high precision performance they often introduce new pathways to large scale, catastrophic failures. Not uncommonly, these new, rare catastrophes have even greater impact than those eliminated by the new technology.  
    
    当新技术被用来消除众所周知的系统故障或获得高精度的性能时，它们往往会引入大规模、灾难性故障的新途径。并不罕见的是，这些新的、罕见的灾难比那些被新技术消除的灾难具有更大的影响。
    
    These new forms of failure are difficult to see before the fact; attention is paid mostly to the putative beneficial characteristics of the changes.  
    
    这些新的失败形式在事实面前是很难看出来的；人们关注的主要是变化的假定的有益特征。  
    
    Because these new, high consequence accidents occur at a low rate, multiple system changes may occur before an accident, making it hard to see the contribution of technology to the failure.  
    
    因为这些新的、后果严重的事故发生率很低，在事故发生前可能会发生多种系统变化，所以很难看到技术对故障的贡献。
    
-   ## [Views of ‘cause’ limit the effectiveness of defenses against future events.  
    
    对 "原因 "的看法限制了对未来事件的防卫效果。](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#15)
    
    Post-accident remedies for “human error” are usually predicated on obstructing activities that can “cause” accidents.  
    
    事故后对 "人为错误 "的补救措施通常是以阻挠可能 "导致 "事故的活动为前提。  
    
    These end-of-the-chain measures do little to reduce the likelihood of further accidents.  
    
    这些链条末端的措施对减少进一步发生事故的可能性作用不大。  
    
    In fact that likelihood of an identical accident is already extraordinarily low because the pattern of latent failures changes constantly.  
    
    事实上，发生相同事故的可能性已经特别低，因为潜伏故障的模式不断变化。  
    
    Instead of increasing safety, post-accident remedies usually increase the coupling and complexity of the system. This increases the potential number of latent failures and also makes the detection and blocking of accident trajectories more difficult.  
    
    事故后的补救措施非但没有提高安全性，通常还增加了系统的耦合性和复杂性。这就增加了潜在的故障数量，也使检测和阻断事故轨迹变得更加困难。
    
-   ## [Safety is a characteristic of systems and not of their components  
    
    安全是系统的特性，而不是其组成部分的特性](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#16)
    
    Safety is an emergent property of systems; it does not reside in a person, device or department of an organization or system.  
    
    安全是系统的一种新兴属性；它不存在于一个组织或系统的某个人、设备或部门中。  
    
    Safety cannot be purchased or manufactured; it is not a feature that is separate from the other components of the system.  
    
    安全性是无法购买或制造的；它不是一个独立于系统其他组成部分的功能。  
    
    This means that safety cannot be manipulated like a feedstock or raw material.  
    
    这意味着，安全不能像原料或原材料那样被操纵。  
    
    The state of safety in any system is always dynamic; continuous systemic change insures that hazard and its management are constantly changing.  
    
    任何系统的安全状态都是动态的；持续的系统变化保证了危险及其管理是不断变化的。
    
-   ## [People continuously create safety.  
    
    人们不断地创造安全。](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#17)
    
    Failure free operations are the result of activities of people who work to keep the system within the boundaries of tolerable performance.  
    
    无故障运行是人们活动的结果，他们努力使系统保持在可容忍的性能范围内。  
    
    These activities are, for the most part, part of normal operations and superficially straightforward.  
    
    这些活动在很大程度上是正常运作的一部分，表面上看很简单。  
    
    But because system operations are never trouble free, human practitioner adaptations to changing conditions actually create safety from moment to moment. These adaptations often amount to just the selection of a well-rehearsed routine from a store of available responses; sometimes, however, the adaptations are novel combinations or de novo creations of new approaches.  
    
    但是，由于系统的运行从来都不是没有问题的，人类实践者对不断变化的条件的适应实际上是在时刻创造安全。这些适应往往只是从现有的反应中选择一个精心排练的程序；但有时，适应是新的组合或新的方法的创造。
    
-   ## [Failure free operations require experience with failure.  
    
    无故障操作需要有失败的经验。](https://how.complexsystems.fail/#18)
    
    Recognizing hazard and successfully manipulating system operations to remain inside the tolerable performance boundaries requires intimate contact with failure.  
    
    识别危险并成功地操纵系统操作以保持在可容忍的性能边界内，需要与故障密切接触。  
    
    More robust system performance is likely to arise in systems where operators can discern the “edge of the envelope”.  
    
    在操作人员能够辨别 "包络边缘 "的系统中，可能会出现更强大的系统性能。  
    
    This is where system performance begins to deteriorate, becomes difficult to predict, or cannot be readily recovered.  
    
    这时，系统性能开始恶化，变得难以预测，或不能轻易恢复。  
    
    In intrinsically hazardous systems, operators are expected to encounter and appreciate hazards in ways that lead to overall performance that is desirable.  
    
    在本质上危险的系统中，操作者被期望以导致理想的整体性能的方式遇到和理解危险。  
    
    Improved safety depends on providing operators with calibrated views of the hazards.  
    
    改善安全取决于为操作人员提供校准的危险观点。  
    
    It also depends on providing calibration about how their actions move system performance towards or away from the edge of the envelope.  
    
    这也取决于提供关于他们的行动如何使系统性能走向或远离包络边缘的校准。
