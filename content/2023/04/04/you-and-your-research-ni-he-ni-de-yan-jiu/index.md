## Richard Hamming

Transcription of the  Bell Communications Research Colloquium Seminar  

7 March 1986 J. F. Kaiser Bell Communications Research  445 South Street  Morristown, NJ 07962-1910 

At a seminar in the Bell Communications Research Colloquia Series, Dr. Richard W.  

在贝尔通信研究座谈会系列的一个研讨会上，理查德-W.博士。  

Hamming, a Professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California and a retired Bell Labs scientist, gave a very interesting and stimulating talk, \`You and Your Research' to an overflow audience of some 200 Bellcore staff members and visitors at the Morris Research and Engineering Center on March 7, 1986. This talk centered on Hamming's observations and research on the question \`\`Why do so few scientists make significant contributions and so many are forgotten in the long run?'' From his more than forty years of experience, thirty of which were at Bell Laboratories, he has made a number of direct observations, asked very pointed questions of scientists about what, how, and why they did things, studied the lives of great scientists and great contributions, and has done introspection and studied theories of creativity.  

1986年3月7日，加州蒙特雷海军研究生院教授、贝尔实验室退休科学家汉明在莫里斯研究与工程中心为约200名贝尔核心工作人员和访客做了一场非常有趣和刺激的讲座--《你和你的研究》。这次讲座的中心内容是汉明对 "为什么很少有科学家做出重大贡献，而很多人在长期内被遗忘 "这一问题的观察和研究。从他四十多年的经验来看，其中三十多年是在贝尔实验室，他做了一些直接的观察，向科学家提出了非常尖锐的问题，问他们做什么，怎么做，为什么做，研究了伟大科学家的生活和伟大的贡献，并做了反省和研究创造理论。  

The talk is about what he has learned in terms of the properties of the individual scientists, their abilities, traits, working habits, attitudes, and philosophy.  

谈的是他在科学家个人的属性、能力、特质、工作习惯、态度和理念方面的心得。

In order to make the information in the talk more widely available, the tape recording that was made of that talk was carefully transcribed.  

为了更广泛地提供谈话中的信息，对该谈话的录音进行了仔细的转录。  

This transcription includes the discussions which followed in the question and answer period.  

本记录包括随后在问答阶段的讨论。  

As with any talk, the transcribed version suffers from translation as all the inflections of voice and the gestures of the speaker are lost; one must listen to the tape recording to recapture that part of the presentation.  

与任何谈话一样，转录的版本受到翻译的影响，因为所有的语音转折和演讲者的手势都丢失了；人们必须听录音来重拾演讲的那一部分。  

While the recording of Richard Hamming's talk was completely intelligible, that of some of the questioner's remarks were not.  

虽然理查德-汉明的谈话录音是完全可以理解的，但提问者的一些话却不能理解。  

Where the tape recording was not intelligible I have added in parentheses my impression of the questioner's remarks.  

在录音不清楚的地方，我在括号里加上了我对提问者言论的印象。  

Where there was a question and I could identify the questioner, I have checked with each to ensure the accuracy of my interpretation of their remarks.  

在有问题并且我可以确定提问者的情况下，我与每个人都进行了核对，以确保我对他们言论的解释是准确的。

**INTRODUCTION OF DR. RICHARD W. HAMMING  

介绍Dr.Richard W. Hamming博士**

As a speaker in the Bell Communications Research Colloquium Series, Dr. Richard W. Hamming of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, was introduced by Alan G.  

作为贝尔通信研究座谈会系列的发言人，加利福尼亚州蒙特雷海军研究生院的Richard W. Hamming博士由Alan G. 介绍。  

Chynoweth, Vice President, Applied Research, Bell Communications Research.  

Chynoweth，贝尔通信研究公司应用研究部副总裁。

_Alan G. Chynoweth:_ Greetings colleagues, and also to many of our former colleagues from Bell Labs who, I understand, are here to be with us today on what I regard as a particularly felicitous occasion.  

阿兰-G-希诺思： 向各位同事问好，也向我们许多来自贝尔实验室的前同事问好，我知道他们今天在这里和我们在一起，我认为这是一个特别令人高兴的时刻。  

It gives me very great pleasure indeed to introduce to you my old friend and colleague from many many years back, Richard Hamming, or Dick Hamming as he has always been know to all of us.  

我确实非常高兴向你们介绍我的老朋友和多年前的同事，理查德-汉明，或者说迪克-汉明，他一直被我们大家所熟知。

Dick is one of the all time greats in the mathematics and computer science arenas, as I'm sure the audience here does not need reminding.  

迪克是数学和计算机科学领域有史以来最伟大的人物之一，我相信这里的观众不需要提醒。  

He received his early education at the Universities of Chicago and Nebraska, and got his Ph.D. at Illinois; he then joined the Los Alamos project during the war.  

他在芝加哥大学和内布拉斯加大学接受早期教育，并在伊利诺伊大学获得博士学位；然后在战争期间加入了洛斯阿拉莫斯项目。  

Afterwards, in 1946, he joined Bell Labs. And that is, of course, where I met Dick - when I joined Bell Labs in their physics research organization.  

此后，在1946年，他加入了贝尔实验室。当然，这就是我遇到迪克的地方--当我加入贝尔实验室的物理研究组织时。  

In those days, we were in the habit of lunching together as a physics group, and for some reason this strange fellow from mathematics was always pleased to join us.  

在那些日子里，我们有作为一个物理学小组一起吃午饭的习惯，由于某些原因，这个来自数学界的奇怪家伙总是很高兴地加入我们。  

We were always happy to have him with us because he brought so many unorthodox ideas and views. Those lunches were stimulating, I can assure you.  

我们总是很高兴有他在一起，因为他带来了许多非正统的想法和观点。我可以向你保证，那些午餐很有刺激性。

While our professional paths have not been very close over the years, nevertheless I've always recognized Dick in the halls of Bell Labs and have always had tremendous admiration for what he was doing.  

虽然多年来我们的职业道路并不十分接近，但我总是在贝尔实验室的大厅里认出迪克，并一直对他所做的事情表示极大的钦佩。  

I think the record speaks for itself.  

我认为记录是不言自明的。  

It is too long to go through all the details, but let me point out, for example, that he has written seven books and of those seven books which tell of various areas of mathematics and computers and coding and information theory, three are already well into their second edition.  

详述所有细节太长了，但让我指出，例如，他已经写了七本书，在这七本讲述数学和计算机以及编码和信息理论各个领域的书中，有三本已经进入第二版。  

That is testimony indeed to the prolific output and the stature of Dick Hamming.  

这确实证明了迪克-汉明的多产和地位。

I think I last met him - it must have been about ten years ago - at a rather curious little conference in Dublin, Ireland where we were both speakers. As always, he was tremendously entertaining.  

我想我最后一次见到他--一定是十年前--是在爱尔兰都柏林的一个相当奇怪的小会议上，我们都是发言人。一如既往，他非常有娱乐性。  

Just one more example of the provocative thoughts that he comes up with: I remember him saying, \`\`There are wavelengths that people cannot see, there are sounds that people cannot hear, and maybe computers have thoughts that people cannot think.'' Well, with Dick Hamming around, we don't need a computer.  

这只是他提出的挑衅性想法的又一个例子：我记得他说："有些波长是人们看不到的，有些声音是人们听不到的，也许计算机也有人们想不到的想法"。好吧，有迪克-汉明在，我们就不需要计算机了。  

I think that we are in for an extremely entertaining talk.  

我认为，我们将迎来一场极具娱乐性的谈话。

**THE TALK: \`\`You and Your Research'' by Dr. Richard W. Hamming  

讲座：Richard W. Hamming博士的 "你和你的研究"。**

It's a pleasure to be here. I doubt if I can live up to the Introduction.  

很高兴来到这里。我怀疑我是否能达到介绍的要求。  

The title of my talk is, \`\`You and Your Research.'' It is not about managing research, it is about how you individually do your research.  

我演讲的题目是："你和你的研究"。它不是关于管理研究，而是关于你个人如何做你的研究。  

I could give a talk on the other subject - but it's not, it's about you. I'm not talking about ordinary run-of-the-mill research; I'm talking about great research.  

我可以就另一个主题进行演讲--但这不是，而是关于你。我说的不是普通的运行研究；我说的是伟大的研究。  

And for the sake of describing great research I'll occasionally say Nobel-Prize type of work.  

而为了描述伟大的研究，我偶尔会说诺贝尔奖类型的工作。  

It doesn't have to gain the Nobel Prize, but I mean those kinds of things which we perceive are significant things.  

它不一定要获得诺贝尔奖，但我的意思是那些我们认为是重要的事情。  

Relativity, if you want, Shannon's information theory, any number of outstanding theories - that's the kind of thing I'm talking about.  

相对论，如果你想的话，香农的信息理论，任何数量的杰出理论--这就是我所谈论的那种东西。

Now, how did I come to do this study? At Los Alamos I was brought in to run the computing machines which other people had got going, so those scientists and physicists could get back to business.  

现在，我是怎么来做这项研究的？在洛斯阿拉莫斯，我被带去运行其他人已经开始使用的计算机器，这样那些科学家和物理学家就可以重新开始工作。  

I saw I was a stooge. I saw that although physically I was the same, they were different. And to put the thing bluntly, I was envious. I wanted to know why they were so different from me.  

我看到我是一个傀儡。我看到，虽然在身体上我是一样的，但他们是不同的。说得直白一点，我很羡慕。我想知道为什么他们与我如此不同。  

I saw Feynman up close. I saw Fermi and Teller. I saw Oppenheimer. I saw Hans Bethe: he was my boss. I saw quite a few very capable people.  

我近距离地看到了费曼。我看到了费米和特勒。我看到了奥本海默。我看到了汉斯-贝特：他是我的老板。我看到了不少非常有能力的人。  

I became very interested in the difference between those who do and those who might have done.  

我开始对那些做的人和那些可能做的人之间的区别非常感兴趣。

When I came to Bell Labs, I came into a very productive department. Bode was the department head at the time; Shannon was there, and there were other people.  

当我来到贝尔实验室时，我来到了一个非常有成效的部门。博德是当时的部门主管；香农在那里，还有其他一些人。  

I continued examining the questions, \`\`Why?'' and \`\`What is the difference?'' I continued subsequently by reading biographies, autobiographies, asking people questions such as: \`\`How did you come to do this?'' I tried to find out what are the differences.  

我继续研究这些问题，"为什么？"和 "有什么区别？随后，我继续阅读传记、自传，问人们一些问题，如：\`你是怎么来做这个的？我试图找出其中的差异。  

And that's what this talk is about.  

而这正是这次谈话的内容。

Now, why is this talk important? I think it is important because, as far as I know, each of you has one life to live.  

现在，为什么这次谈话很重要？我认为它很重要，因为据我所知，你们每个人都有一个生命要过。  

Even if you believe in reincarnation it doesn't do you any good from one life to the next! Why shouldn't you do significant things in this one life, however you define significant?  

即使你相信轮回，从这一世到下一世对你也没有任何好处！为什么你不能在这一世做重要的事情呢？为什么你不应该在这一生中做有意义的事情，不管你如何定义有意义？  

I'm not going to define it - you know what I mean. I will talk mainly about science because that is what I have studied.  

我不打算给它下定义--你知道我的意思。我将主要谈论科学，因为这是我研究的内容。  

But so far as I know, and I've been told by others, much of what I say applies to many fields.  

但据我所知，而且别人也告诉我，我说的大部分内容适用于许多领域。  

Outstanding work is characterized very much the same way in most fields, but I will confine myself to science.  

杰出的工作在大多数领域都有非常相同的特点，但我将只限于科学。

In order to get at you individually, I must talk in the first person.  

为了单独对付你，我必须用第一人称说话。  

I have to get you to drop modesty and say to yourself, \`\`Yes, I would like to do first-class work.'' Our society frowns on people who set out to do really good work.  

我必须让你放下谦虚，对自己说："是的，我想做一流的工作。我们的社会对那些立志要做真正好工作的人不屑一顾。  

You're not supposed to; luck is supposed to descend on you and you do great things by chance. Well, that's a kind of dumb thing to say. I say, why shouldn't you set out to do something significant.  

你不应该这样做；运气应该降临到你身上，你做伟大的事情是偶然的。嗯，这样说有点傻。我说，为什么你不应该着手做一些重要的事情。  

You don't have to tell other people, but shouldn't you say to yourself, \`\`Yes, I would like to do something significant.''  

你不必告诉其他人，但你不应该对自己说："是的，我想做一些重要的事情。

In order to get to the second stage, I have to drop modesty and talk in the first person about what I've seen, what I've done, and what I've heard.  

为了进入第二个阶段，我必须放下谦虚，以第一人称谈论我所看到的、我所做的和我所听到的事情。  

I'm going to talk about people, some of whom you know, and I trust that when we leave, you won't quote me as saying some of the things I said.  

我将谈论一些人，其中一些人你们认识，我相信当我们离开时，你们不会引用我说的一些话。

Let me start not logically, but psychologically. I find that the major objection is that people think great science is done by luck. It's all a matter of luck. Well, consider Einstein.  

让我不是从逻辑上，而是从心理上开始。我发现，主要的反对意见是，人们认为伟大的科学是靠运气完成的。这都是运气的问题。那么，考虑一下爱因斯坦。  

Note how many different things he did that were good. Was it all luck? Wasn't it a little too repetitive? Consider Shannon. He didn't do just information theory.  

注意他做了多少不同的事情，都是好的。这都是运气吗？是不是有点太重复了？考虑一下香农。他做的不仅仅是信息理论。  

Several years before, he did some other good things and some which are still locked up in the security of cryptography. He did many good things.  

几年前，他还做了一些其他的好事，有些还被锁在密码学的安全中。他做了很多好事情。

You see again and again, that it is more than one thing from a good person.  

你一次又一次地看到，这不仅仅是一个好人的一件事。  

Once in a while a person does only one thing in his whole life, and we'll talk about that later, but a lot of times there is repetition. I claim that luck will not cover everything.  

偶尔一个人一生只做一件事，我们以后再谈这个问题，但很多时候是有重复的。我声称，运气不会涵盖一切。  

And I will cite Pasteur who said, \`\`Luck favors the prepared mind.'' And I think that says it the way I believe it. There is indeed an element of luck, and no, there isn't.  

我将引用巴斯德的话，他说："幸运之神眷顾有准备的人"。而我认为这句话说出了我的看法。确实有运气的成分，不，也没有。  

The prepared mind sooner or later finds something important and does it. So yes, it is luck. The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is not.  

有准备的头脑迟早会发现一些重要的事情，并去做。因此，是的，这是运气。你做的特定事情是运气，但你做的事情不是运气。

For example, when I came to Bell Labs, I shared an office for a while with Shannon. At the same time he was doing information theory, I was doing coding theory.  

例如，当我来到贝尔实验室时，我与香农共用了一段时间的办公室。在他做信息理论的同时，我在做编码理论。  

It is suspicious that the two of us did it at the same place and at the same time - it was in the atmosphere.  

令人怀疑的是，我们两个人在同一地点、同一时间做了这件事--是在大气层中。  

And you can say, \`\`Yes, it was luck.'' On the other hand you can say, \`\`But why of all the people in Bell Labs then were those the two who did it?'' Yes, it is partly luck, and partly it is the prepared mind; but \`partly' is the other thing I'm going to talk about.  

你可以说，"是的，这是运气"。另一方面，你可以说，\`但为什么在贝尔实验室的所有人员中，只有这两个人做到了呢'？是的，部分是运气，部分是有准备的头脑；但 "部分 "是我要谈的另一件事。  

So, although I'll come back several more times to luck, I want to dispose of this matter of luck as being the sole criterion whether you do great work or not.  

因此，尽管我还会多次回到运气问题上，但我想把运气作为你是否做了伟大工作的唯一标准来处理这个问题。  

I claim you have some, but not total, control over it. And I will quote, finally, Newton on the matter.  

我声称你对它有一些控制，但不是完全控制。最后，我将引用牛顿在这个问题上的观点。  

Newton said, \`\`If others would think as hard as I did, then they would get similar results.''  

牛顿说，"如果其他人能像我一样努力思考，那么他们也会得到类似的结果。

One of the characteristics you see, and many people have it including great scientists, is that usually when they were young they had independent thoughts and had the courage to pursue them.  

你看到的一个特点，很多人都有这个特点，包括伟大的科学家，通常在他们年轻的时候就有独立的想法，并有勇气去追求这些想法。  

For example, Einstein, somewhere around 12 or 14, asked himself the question, \`\`What would a light wave look like if I went with the velocity of light to look at it?'' Now he knew that electromagnetic theory says you cannot have a stationary local maximum.  

例如，爱因斯坦在12或14岁左右，问自己一个问题："如果我以光速去看，光波会是什么样子？现在他知道，电磁理论说你不可能有一个固定的局部最大值。  

But if he moved along with the velocity of light, he would see a local maximum.  

但如果他随着光速移动，他将看到一个局部的最大值。  

He could see a contradiction at the age of 12, 14, or somewhere around there, that everything was not right and that the velocity of light had something peculiar.  

他在12、14岁的时候，或者在那附近就能看到一个矛盾，认为一切都不对，光速有一些特殊的地方。  

Is it luck that he finally created special relativity? Early on, he had laid down some of the pieces by thinking of the fragments. Now that's the necessary but not sufficient condition.  

他最终创造了狭义相对论，这是运气吗？早期，他通过对碎片的思考，奠定了一些碎片。现在这就是必要但不充分的条件。  

All of these items I will talk about are both luck and not luck.  

我将谈论的所有这些项目既是运气，也不是运气。

How about having lots of \`brains?' It sounds good. Most of you in this room probably have more than enough brains to do first-class work. But great work is something else than mere brains.  

有很多 "大脑 "怎么样？这听起来不错。你们在座的大多数人可能都有足够的大脑来做一流的工作。但是，伟大的工作是比单纯的大脑更重要的东西。  

Brains are measured in various ways. In mathematics, theoretical physics, astrophysics, typically brains correlates to a great extent with the ability to manipulate symbols.  

大脑是以各种方式测量的。在数学、理论物理学、天体物理学中，通常大脑在很大程度上与操纵符号的能力相关。  

And so the typical IQ test is apt to score them fairly high. On the other hand, in other fields it is something different.  

因此，典型的智商测试很可能会给他们打出相当高的分数。另一方面，在其他领域，情况则有所不同。  

For example, Bill Pfann, the fellow who did zone melting, came into my office one day. He had this idea dimly in his mind about what he wanted and he had some equations.  

例如，比尔-普凡，那个做区域熔化的家伙，有一天来到我的办公室。他的脑海中有一个关于他想要的东西的模糊想法，他有一些方程式。  

It was pretty clear to me that this man didn't know much mathematics and he wasn't really articulate. His problem seemed interesting so I took it home and did a little work.  

我很清楚，这个人不太懂数学，而且他也不太善于表达。他的问题似乎很有趣，所以我把它带回家，做了一点工作。  

I finally showed him how to run computers so he could compute his own answers. I gave him the power to compute.  

我最终向他展示了如何运行计算机，以便他能够计算出自己的答案。我给了他计算的权力。  

He went ahead, with negligible recognition from his own department, but ultimately he has collected all the prizes in the field.  

他一往无前，自己部门的认可微乎其微，但最终他收集了该领域的所有奖项。  

Once he got well started, his shyness, his awkwardness, his inarticulateness, fell away and he became much more productive in many other ways. Certainly he became much more articulate.  

一旦他有了良好的开端，他的害羞、笨拙、不善言辞就会消失，他在其他许多方面变得更有成效。当然，他变得更善于表达。

And I can cite another person in the same way. I trust he isn't in the audience, i.e. a fellow named Clogston.  

我还可以用同样的方式举出另一个人。我相信他不在观众席上，也就是一个叫克洛格斯顿的家伙。  

I met him when I was working on a problem with John Pierce's group and I didn't think he had much.  

我是在与约翰-皮尔斯的小组合作解决一个问题时认识他的，我认为他没有什么本事。  

I asked my friends who had been with him at school, \`\`Was he like that in graduate school?'' \`\`Yes,'' they replied. Well I would have fired the fellow, but J. R. Pierce was smart and kept him on.  

我问我那些在学校和他在一起的朋友，\`\`他在研究生院也是这样吗？\`是的，'他们回答说。好吧，我本来想解雇这个家伙，但J.R.皮尔斯很聪明，把他留了下来。  

Clogston finally did the Clogston cable. After that there was a steady stream of good ideas. One success brought him confidence and courage.  

克洛格斯顿终于做了克洛格斯顿电缆。此后，好点子源源不断。一次次的成功给他带来了信心和勇气。

One of the characteristics of successful scientists is having courage. Once you get your courage up and believe that you can do important problems, then you can.  

成功的科学家的特征之一是有勇气。一旦你鼓起勇气，相信你可以做重要的问题，那么你就可以。  

If you think you can't, almost surely you are not going to. Courage is one of the things that Shannon had supremely. You have only to think of his major theorem.  

如果你认为你不能，几乎可以肯定你是不会的。勇气是香农极度拥有的东西之一。你只要想想他的主要定理就知道了。  

He wants to create a method of coding, but he doesn't know what to do so he makes a random code. Then he is stuck.  

他想创造一种编码方法，但他不知道该怎么做，所以他做了一个随机编码。然后他就被卡住了。  

And then he asks the impossible question, \`\`What would the average random code do?'' He then proves that the average code is arbitrarily good, and that therefore there must be at least one good code.  

然后他提出了一个不可能的问题："平均随机代码会做什么？然后他证明，平均代码是任意好的，因此，至少有一个好的代码。  

Who but a man of infinite courage could have dared to think those thoughts? That is the characteristic of great scientists; they have courage.  

除了一个有无限勇气的人，谁还敢想这些想法？这就是伟大科学家的特点；他们有勇气。  

They will go forward under incredible circumstances; they think and continue to think.  

他们将在不可思议的情况下前进；他们思考并继续思考。

Age is another factor which the physicists particularly worry about. They always are saying that you have got to do it when you are young or you will never do it.  

年龄是物理学家们特别担心的另一个因素。他们总是在说，你必须在年轻的时候做，否则你将永远做不到。  

Einstein did things very early, and all the quantum mechanic fellows were disgustingly young when they did their best work.  

爱因斯坦很早就做了一些事情，所有的量子力学研究员在做他们最好的工作时都很年轻，令人厌恶。  

Most mathematicians, theoretical physicists, and astrophysicists do what we consider their best work when they are young.  

大多数数学家、理论物理学家和天体物理学家在年轻时做了我们认为是他们最好的工作。  

It is not that they don't do good work in their old age but what we value most is often what they did early.  

并不是说他们在晚年没有做好工作，而是我们最看重的往往是他们早期的工作。  

On the other hand, in music, politics and literature, often what we consider their best work was done late. I don't know how whatever field you are in fits this scale, but age has some effect.  

另一方面，在音乐、政治和文学方面，往往我们认为他们最好的工作是在后期完成的。我不知道你所处的任何领域如何符合这个尺度，但年龄有一些影响。

But let me say why age seems to have the effect it does. In the first place if you do some good work you will find yourself on all kinds of committees and unable to do any more work.  

但让我说说为什么年龄似乎有这样的影响。首先，如果你做了一些好的工作，你会发现自己在各种委员会中，无法再做任何工作。  

You may find yourself as I saw Brattain when he got a Nobel Prize. The day the prize was announced we all assembled in Arnold Auditorium; all three winners got up and made speeches.  

你可能会发现自己就像我看到布拉坦获得诺贝尔奖时一样。宣布获奖的那天，我们都聚集在阿诺德礼堂；三位获奖者都站起来发表了讲话。  

The third one, Brattain, practically with tears in his eyes, said, \`\`I know about this Nobel-Prize effect and I am not going to let it affect me; I am going to remain good old Walter Brattain.'' Well I said to myself, \`\`That is nice.'' But in a few weeks I saw it was affecting him.  

第三个人，布拉坦，几乎是含着眼泪说："我知道这个诺贝尔奖的影响，我不会让它影响我；我将继续做一个好的老沃尔特-布拉坦"。我对自己说，"这很好。但在几个星期后，我看到它正在影响他。  

Now he could only work on great problems.  

现在他只能致力于解决伟大的问题。

When you are famous it is hard to work on small problems. This is what did Shannon in. After information theory, what do you do for an encore? The great scientists often make this error.  

当你成名时，很难在小问题上下功夫。这就是香农的原因。在信息理论之后，你要做的是什么？伟大的科学家们经常犯这个错误。  

They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow. They try to get the big thing right off. And that isn't the way things go.  

他们未能继续种植小橡子，而强大的橡树正是从这些小橡子中生长出来的。他们试图马上得到大的东西。而这并不是事情的发展方向。  

So that is another reason why you find that when you get early recognition it seems to sterilize you. In fact I will give you my favorite quotation of many years.  

所以这也是为什么你发现当你得到早期认可时，似乎会使你不育的另一个原因。事实上，我将给你我多年来最喜欢的引文。  

The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, in my opinion, has ruined more good scientists than any institution has created, judged by what they did before they came and judged by what they did after.  

在我看来，普林斯顿高等研究所毁掉的优秀科学家比任何机构创造的都要多，根据他们来之前的表现和之后的表现来判断。  

Not that they weren't good afterwards, but they were superb before they got there and were only good afterwards.  

不是说他们事后不好，而是他们在到达那里之前是极好的，事后才好。

This brings up the subject, out of order perhaps, of working conditions. What most people think are the best working conditions, are not.  

这带来了工作条件的话题，也许是不合时宜的。大多数人认为是最好的工作条件，其实不然。  

Very clearly they are not because people are often most productive when working conditions are bad.  

很明显，他们不是这样的，因为人们在工作条件不好的时候往往是生产力最高的。  

One of the better times of the Cambridge Physical Laboratories was when they had practically shacks - they did some of the best physics ever.  

剑桥物理实验室的一个较好的时代是他们几乎有棚屋的时候--他们做了一些有史以来最好的物理学。

I give you a story from my own private life.  

我给你们讲一个我自己私人生活中的故事。  

Early on it became evident to me that Bell Laboratories was not going to give me the conventional acre of programming people to program computing machines in absolute binary.  

早期我就发现，贝尔实验室不会给我传统的一亩三分地，让人们用绝对二进制的方式为计算机编程。  

It was clear they weren't going to. But that was the way everybody did it.  

很明显，他们不打算这样做。但这是每个人的做法。  

I could go to the West Coast and get a job with the airplane companies without any trouble, but the exciting people were at Bell Labs and the fellows out there in the airplane companies were not.  

我可以去西海岸，在飞机公司找到一份工作，没有任何麻烦，但令人兴奋的人都在贝尔实验室，而外面的飞机公司的伙计们却没有。  

I thought for a long while about, \`\`Did I want to go or not?'' and I wondered how I could get the best of two possible worlds.  

我想了很久，"我到底想不想去？"我想知道如何才能获得两个可能的世界中最好的结果。  

I finally said to myself, \`\`Hamming, you think the machines can do practically everything.  

我最后对自己说："汉明，你认为机器几乎可以做任何事情。  

Why can't you make them write programs?'' What appeared at first to me as a defect forced me into automatic programming very early.  

为什么你不能让他们写程序？起初在我看来是一个缺陷，迫使我很早就进入自动编程。  

What appears to be a fault, often, by a change of viewpoint, turns out to be one of the greatest assets you can have.  

看上去是一个错误，但通过改变观点，往往会变成你能拥有的最大资产之一。  

But you are not likely to think that when you first look the thing and say, \`\`Gee, I'm never going to get enough programmers, so how can I ever do any great programming?''  

但是，当你第一次看这个东西并说："哎呀，我永远不会有足够的程序员，所以我怎么能做任何伟大的编程？"你不可能这样想。

And there are many other stories of the same kind; Grace Hopper has similar ones.  

还有许多其他同类的故事；格雷斯-霍普有类似的故事。  

I think that if you look carefully you will see that often the great scientists, by turning the problem around a bit, changed a defect to an asset.  

我认为，如果你仔细观察，你会发现，伟大的科学家往往通过把问题转过来一点，把一个缺陷变成了一种资产。  

For example, many scientists when they found they couldn't do a problem finally began to study why not.  

例如，许多科学家当他们发现自己不能做一个问题时，最后开始研究为什么不能。  

They then turned it around the other way and said, \`\`But of course, this is what it is'' and got an important result. So ideal working conditions are very strange.  

然后他们反过来说，"但当然，这就是事实"，得到了一个重要的结果。因此，理想的工作条件是非常奇怪的。  

The ones you want aren't always the best ones for you.  

你想要的并不总是最适合你的。

Now for the matter of drive. You observe that most great scientists have tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell Labs. He had tremendous drive.  

现在说说动力的问题。你观察到，大多数伟大的科学家都有巨大的动力。我在贝尔实验室与约翰-图基共事了十年。他有巨大的动力。  

One day about three or four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and I clearly was not.  

在我加入后大约三四年的某一天，我发现约翰-图克比我略微年轻。约翰是个天才，而我显然不是。  

Well I went storming into Bode's office and said, \`\`How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does?'' He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, \`\`You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years.'' I simply slunk out of the office!  

好吧，我冲进博德的办公室，说："我这个年龄的人怎么能像约翰-图基那样知道这么多？他靠在椅子上，把双手放在脑后，微微一笑，说："你会惊讶的，汉明，如果你像他那样努力工作那么多年，你会知道多少。我干脆溜出了办公室！"！

What Bode was saying was this: \`\`Knowledge and productivity are like compound interest.'' Given two people of approximately the same ability and one person who works ten percent more than the other, the latter will more than twice outproduce the former.  

博德的意思是这样的：\`知识和生产力就像复利一样'。如果有两个能力大致相同的人，一个人比另一个人多工作百分之十，那么后者会比前者多出两倍以上的产量。  

The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much like compound interest.  

你知道的越多，你学的越多；你学的越多，你能做的越多；你能做的越多，机会就越多--这非常像复利。  

I don't want to give you a rate, but it is a very high rate.  

我不想给你一个比率，但这是一个非常高的比率。  

Given two people with exactly the same ability, the one person who manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be tremendously more productive over a lifetime.  

如果有两个能力完全相同的人，一个人日复一日地设法多思考一个小时，那么他一生中的生产力就会大大增加。  

I took Bode's remark to heart; I spent a good deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done.  

我把博德的话记在心里；在一些年里，我花了大量的时间来努力工作，我发现，事实上，我可以完成更多的工作。  

I don't like to say it in front of my wife, but I did sort of neglect her sometimes; I needed to study. You have to neglect things if you intend to get what you want done.  

我不喜欢在我妻子面前说这些，但我有时确实有点忽视她；我需要学习。如果你打算完成你想做的事情，你就必须忽视一些事情。  

There's no question about this.  

这一点是毫无疑问的。

On this matter of drive Edison says, \`\`Genius is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration.'' He may have been exaggerating, but the idea is that solid work, steadily applied, gets you surprisingly far.  

关于这个动力问题，爱迪生说："天才是99%的汗水和1%的灵感。他可能是在夸大其词，但他的想法是，扎实的工作，稳定的应用，能让你走得更远，令人惊讶。  

The steady application of effort with a little bit more work, _intelligently applied_ is what does it. That's the trouble; drive, misapplied, doesn't get you anywhere.  

稳定地应用努力，多做一点工作，明智地应用，才能做到这一点。这就是问题所在；驱动力如果应用不当，不会让你有任何收获。  

I've often wondered why so many of my good friends at Bell Labs who worked as hard or harder than I did, didn't have so much to show for it. The misapplication of effort is a very serious matter.  

我经常想，为什么我在贝尔实验室的许多好朋友，他们和我一样努力工作，甚至比我更努力，却没有那么多的成果。误用努力是一个非常严重的问题。  

Just hard work is not enough - it must be applied sensibly.  

仅仅努力工作是不够的--必须合理地运用。

There's another trait on the side which I want to talk about; that trait is ambiguity. It took me a while to discover its importance. Most people like to believe something is or is not true.  

边上还有一个我想谈的特质；这个特质就是模糊性。我花了一段时间才发现它的重要性。大多数人喜欢相信一些事情是或不是真的。  

Great scientists tolerate ambiguity very well.  

伟大的科学家能够很好地容忍模糊性。  

They believe the theory enough to go ahead; they doubt it enough to notice the errors and faults so they can step forward and create the new replacement theory.  

他们相信这个理论，足以让他们继续前进；他们怀疑这个理论，足以让他们注意到错误和缺点，所以他们可以站出来，创造新的替代理论。  

If you believe too much you'll never notice the flaws; if you doubt too much you won't get started. It requires a lovely balance.  

如果你太相信，你永远不会注意到缺陷；如果你太怀疑，你就不会开始。这需要一个可爱的平衡。  

But most great scientists are well aware of why their theories are true and they are also well aware of some slight misfits which don't quite fit and they don't forget it.  

但大多数伟大的科学家都很清楚为什么他们的理论是真实的，他们也很清楚一些不太适合的轻微错误，他们也不会忘记这一点。  

Darwin writes in his autobiography that he found it necessary to write down every piece of evidence which appeared to contradict his beliefs because otherwise they would disappear from his mind.  

达尔文在他的自传中写道，他发现有必要写下每一个似乎与他的信仰相矛盾的证据，因为否则这些证据就会从他的头脑中消失。  

When you find apparent flaws you've got to be sensitive and keep track of those things, and keep an eye out for how they can be explained or how the theory can be changed to fit them.  

当你发现明显的缺陷时，你必须敏感地跟踪这些东西，并留意如何解释它们，或如何改变理论以适应它们。  

Those are often the great contributions. Great contributions are rarely done by adding another decimal place. It comes down to an emotional commitment.  

这些往往是伟大的贡献。伟大的贡献很少是通过增加一个小数位来完成的。它归结为一种情感承诺。  

Most great scientists are completely committed to their problem. Those who don't become committed seldom produce outstanding, first-class work.  

大多数伟大的科学家都完全致力于他们的问题。那些没有投入的人很少能做出杰出的、一流的工作。

Now again, emotional commitment is not enough. It is a necessary condition apparently. And I think I can tell you the reason why.  

现在再说一遍，仅有情感承诺是不够的。它显然是一个必要条件。我想我可以告诉你其中的原因。  

Everybody who has studied creativity is driven finally to saying, \`\`creativity comes out of your subconscious.'' Somehow, suddenly, there it is. It just appears.  

每个研究过创造力的人最后都会说："创造力来自于你的潜意识。不知何故，突然间，它出现了。它就这样出现了。  

Well, we know very little about the subconscious; but one thing you are pretty well aware of is that your dreams also come out of your subconscious.  

好吧，我们对潜意识知之甚少；但有一件事你很清楚，你的梦也来自你的潜意识。  

And you're aware your dreams are, to a fair extent, a reworking of the experiences of the day.  

而且你意识到你的梦在相当程度上是对一天的经历的重塑。  

If you are deeply immersed and committed to a topic, day after day after day, your subconscious has nothing to do but work on your problem.  

如果你日复一日地深深沉浸并致力于一个主题，你的潜意识就无事可做，只能在你的问题上努力。  

And so you wake up one morning, or on some afternoon, and there's the answer.  

于是你在某个早晨，或者某个下午醒来，就有了答案。  

For those who don't get committed to their current problem, the subconscious goofs off on other things and doesn't produce the big result.  

对于那些没有致力于解决当前问题的人来说，潜意识会在其他事情上胡作非为，不会产生大的结果。  

So the way to manage yourself is that when you have a real important problem you don't let anything else get the center of your attention - you keep your thoughts on the problem.  

因此，管理自己的方法是，当你有一个真正重要的问题时，你不要让其他东西成为你注意力的中心--你要把你的想法放在问题上。  

Keep your subconscious starved so it has to work on _your_ problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer in the morning, free.  

让你的潜意识处于饥饿状态，这样它就不得不为你的问题而努力，这样你就可以安然入睡，并在早上得到答案，免费的。

Now Alan Chynoweth mentioned that I used to eat at the physics table.  

现在Alan Chynoweth提到我曾经在物理学桌上吃饭。  

I had been eating with the mathematicians and I found out that I already knew a fair amount of mathematics; in fact, I wasn't learning much.  

我曾和数学家们一起吃饭，我发现我已经知道了相当多的数学知识；事实上，我并没有学到多少。  

The physics table was, as he said, an exciting place, but I think he exaggerated on how much I contributed. It was very interesting to listen to Shockley, Brattain, Bardeen, J. B.  

正如他所说，物理学桌是一个令人兴奋的地方，但我认为他夸大了我的贡献有多大。听Shockley、Brattain、Bardeen、J.B.的讲话非常有趣。  

Johnson, Ken McKay and other people, and I was learning a lot. But unfortunately a Nobel Prize came, and a promotion came, and what was left was the dregs. Nobody wanted what was left.  

约翰逊、肯-麦凯和其他人，我学到了很多。但不幸的是，诺贝尔奖来了，升职也来了，剩下的就是渣滓了。没有人想要剩下的东西。  

Well, there was no use eating with them!  

好吧，和他们一起吃饭是没有用的!

Over on the other side of the dining hall was a chemistry table. I had worked with one of the fellows, Dave McCall; furthermore he was courting our secretary at the time.  

在饭厅的另一边是一张化学桌。我曾与其中一位研究员戴夫-麦考尔共事；此外，他当时还在追求我们的秘书。  

I went over and said, \`\`Do you mind if I join you?'' They can't say no, so I started eating with them for a while.  

我走过去，说："你们介意我加入你们吗？他们不能说不，所以我开始和他们一起吃了一会儿。  

And I started asking, \`\`What are the important problems of your field?'' And after a week or so, \`\`What important problems are you working on?'' And after some more time I came in one day and said, \`\`If what you are doing is not important, and if you don't think it is going to lead to something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?'' I wasn't welcomed after that; I had to find somebody else to eat with!  

我开始问："你们领域的重要问题是什么？过了一个星期左右，"你在研究什么重要问题？又过了一段时间，有一天我进来说："如果你正在做的事情不重要，如果你认为它不会带来重要的东西，你为什么要在贝尔实验室工作？从那以后我就不受欢迎了；我不得不找别人一起吃饭！"！  

That was in the spring.  

那是在春天。

In the fall, Dave McCall stopped me in the hall and said, \`\`Hamming, that remark of yours got underneath my skin. I thought about it all summer, i.e. what were the important problems in my field.  

秋天，戴夫-麦考尔在大厅里拦住我说："汉明，你的那句话让我很不舒服。我整个夏天都在思考这个问题，也就是说，在我的领域有哪些重要问题。  

I haven't changed my research,'' he says, \`\`but I think it was well worthwhile.'' And I said, \`\`Thank you Dave,'' and went on.  

我没有改变我的研究，"他说，"但我认为这很值得。我说，'谢谢你，戴夫'，然后继续前进。  

I noticed a couple of months later he was made the head of the department. I noticed the other day he was a Member of the National Academy of Engineering. I noticed he has succeeded.  

我注意到几个月后他被任命为该部门的负责人。我注意到有一天他是国家工程院的成员。我注意到他已经成功了。  

I have never heard the names of any of the other fellows at that table mentioned in science and scientific circles.  

我从来没有听说过在科学和科学界提到过那张桌子上的任何其他研究员的名字。  

They were unable to ask themselves, \`\`What are the important problems in my field?''  

他们无法问自己："我的领域里有哪些重要问题？

If you do not work on an important problem, it's unlikely you'll do important work. It's perfectly obvious.  

如果你不在一个重要的问题上工作，你就不太可能做重要的工作。这一点非常明显。  

Great scientists have thought through, in a careful way, a number of important problems in their field, and they keep an eye on wondering how to attack them.  

伟大的科学家以谨慎的方式思考过他们领域的一些重要问题，他们一直在思考如何攻克这些问题。  

Let me warn you, \`important problem' must be phrased carefully. The three outstanding problems in physics, in a certain sense, were never worked on while I was at Bell Labs.  

让我提醒你，"重要的问题 "必须谨慎措辞。物理学中的三个突出问题，从某种意义上说，在我在贝尔实验室的时候，从来没有进行过研究。  

By important I mean guaranteed a Nobel Prize and any sum of money you want to mention. We didn't work on (1) time travel, (2) teleportation, and (3) antigravity.  

我说的重要是指保证获得诺贝尔奖和你想提的任何一笔钱。我们没有研究（1）时间旅行，（2）传送，和（3）反重力。  

They are not important problems because we do not have an attack. It's not the consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack.  

它们不是重要的问题，因为我们没有攻击。使一个问题变得重要的不是后果，而是你有一个合理的攻击。  

That is what makes a problem important. When I say that most scientists don't work on important problems, I mean it in that sense.  

这就是使问题重要的原因。当我说大多数科学家不从事重要问题的研究时，我是指这个意义上的。  

The average scientist, so far as I can make out, spends almost all his time working on problems which he believes will not be important and he also doesn't believe that they will lead to important problems.  

就我所知，一般的科学家几乎把所有的时间都花在他认为不重要的问题上，他也不相信这些问题会导致重要的问题。

I spoke earlier about planting acorns so that oaks will grow. You can't always know exactly where to be, but you can keep active in places where something might happen.  

我之前谈到了种植橡子，这样橡树就会生长。你不可能总是知道确切的位置，但你可以在可能发生事情的地方保持活跃。  

And even if you believe that great science is a matter of luck, you can stand on a mountain top where lightning strikes; you don't have to hide in the valley where you're safe.  

即使你相信伟大的科学是一个运气问题，你可以站在山顶上的闪电，你不需要躲在山谷里，你是安全的。  

But the average scientist does routine safe work almost all the time and so he (or she) doesn't produce much. It's that simple.  

但是普通的科学家几乎一直在做常规的安全工作，所以他（或她）没有什么成果。就是这么简单。  

If you want to do great work, you clearly must work on important problems, and you should have an idea.  

如果你想做伟大的工作，你显然必须研究重要的问题，而且你应该有一个想法。

Along those lines at some urging from John Tukey and others, I finally adopted what I called \`\`Great Thoughts Time.'' When I went to lunch Friday noon, I would only discuss great thoughts after that.  

沿着这些思路，在约翰-图基和其他人的敦促下，我最终采用了我称之为 "伟大思想时间 "的做法。当我周五中午去吃午饭时，我只会在那之后讨论伟大的思想。  

By great thoughts I mean ones like: \`\`What will be the role of computers in all of AT&T?'', \`\`How will computers change science?'' For example, I came up with the observation at that time that nine out of ten experiments were done in the lab and one in ten on the computer.  

我所说的伟大思想是指像这样的思想：\`计算机在所有AT&T中的作用将是什么？'，\`计算机将如何改变科学？例如，我当时提出了这样的看法：十项实验中有九项是在实验室完成的，十项中有一项是在计算机上完成的。  

I made a remark to the vice presidents one time, that it would be reversed, i.e. nine out of ten experiments would be done on the computer and one in ten in the lab.  

有一次，我对副总统们说，这将是相反的，即10个实验中有9个是在电脑上做的，10个中有1个是在实验室做的。  

They knew I was a crazy mathematician and had no sense of reality.  

他们知道我是个疯狂的数学家，对现实毫无感觉。  

I knew they were wrong and they've been proved wrong while I have been proved right. They built laboratories when they didn't need them.  

我知道他们是错的，他们已经被证明是错的，而我却被证明是对的。他们在不需要实验室的时候建造了实验室。  

I saw that computers were transforming science because I spent a lot of time asking \`\`What will be the impact of computers on science and how can I change it?'' I asked myself, \`\`How is it going to change Bell Labs?'' I remarked one time, in the same address, that more than one-half of the people at Bell Labs will be interacting closely with computing machines before I leave.  

我看到计算机正在改变科学，因为我花了很多时间问 "计算机将对科学产生什么影响，我如何才能改变它？我问自己，"它将如何改变贝尔实验室？有一次，我在同一个讲话中说，在我离开之前，贝尔实验室有超过一半的人将与计算机器密切互动。  

Well, you all have terminals now. I thought hard about where was my field going, where were the opportunities, and what were the important things to do.  

好了，你们现在都有终端。我认真思考了我的领域将走向何方，机会在哪里，有哪些重要的事情要做。  

Let me go there so there is a chance I can do important things.  

让我去那里，这样我就有机会做重要的事情。

Most great scientists know many important problems. They have something between 10 and 20 important problems for which they are looking for an attack.  

大多数伟大的科学家知道许多重要的问题。他们有10到20个重要的问题，他们正在寻找一个攻击。  

And when they see a new idea come up, one hears them say \`\`Well that bears on this problem.'' They drop all the other things and get after it.  

当他们看到一个新的想法出现时，就会听到他们说："这对这个问题有影响。他们放弃了所有其他的事情，开始追求这个问题。  

Now I can tell you a horror story that was told to me but I can't vouch for the truth of it.  

现在我可以告诉你一个有人告诉我的恐怖故事，但我不能保证它的真实性。  

I was sitting in an airport talking to a friend of mine from Los Alamos about how it was lucky that the fission experiment occurred over in Europe when it did because that got us working on the atomic bomb here in the US.  

我曾坐在机场与我的一位来自洛斯阿拉莫斯的朋友谈论，裂变实验在欧洲发生时是多么幸运，因为这使我们在美国这里研究原子弹。  

He said \`\`No; at Berkeley we had gathered a bunch of data; we didn't get around to reducing it because we were building some more equipment, but if we had reduced that data we would have found fission.'' They had it in their hands and they didn't pursue it.  

他说："不；在伯克利，我们收集了一堆数据；我们没有着手减少数据，因为我们正在建造更多的设备，但如果我们减少这些数据，我们就会发现裂变。他们手里有这个数据，但他们没有继续下去。

They came in second!  

他们获得了第二名!

The great scientists, when an opportunity opens up, get after it and they pursue it. They drop all other things.  

伟大的科学家，一旦有机会出现，就会去追求它。他们放弃所有其他的事情。  

They get rid of other things and they get after an idea because they had already thought the thing through. Their minds are prepared; they see the opportunity and they go after it.  

他们摆脱其他事情，追寻一个想法，因为他们已经把事情想清楚了。他们的头脑已经准备好了；他们看到了机会，就会去追求它。  

Now of course lots of times it doesn't work out, but you don't have to hit many of them to do some great science. It's kind of easy. One of the chief tricks is to live a long time!  

当然，很多时候它并不奏效，但你不必打很多人就能做一些伟大的科学。这是很容易的。主要的技巧之一是活得久一点！"！

Another trait, it took me a while to notice. I noticed the following facts about people who work with the door open or the door closed.  

另一个特质，我花了一段时间才注意到。我注意到关于那些工作时开门或关门的人的以下事实。  

I notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most.  

我注意到，如果你把办公室的门关上，你今天和明天就能完成更多的工作，而且你的工作效率比大多数人高。  

But 10 years later somehow you don't know quite know what problems are worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in importance.  

但10年后，不知为何，你不太知道哪些问题值得去研究；你所做的所有艰苦工作在重要性上都有点切肤之痛。  

He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.  

敞开门工作的人得到各种干扰，但他也偶尔得到关于世界是什么和什么可能是重要的线索。  

Now I cannot prove the cause and effect sequence because you might say, \`\`The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind.'' I don't know.  

现在我无法证明因果序列，因为你可能会说："关着的门象征着封闭的思想"。我不知道。  

But I can say there is a pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors closed often work harder.  

但我可以说，那些开门工作的人和那些最终做重要事情的人之间有相当好的相关性，尽管关门工作的人往往更努力。

Somehow they seem to work on slightly the wrong thing - not much, but enough that they miss fame.  

不知何故，他们似乎在稍微错误的事情上努力--不多，但足以让他们错过名声。

I want to talk on another topic. It is based on the song which I think many of you know, \`\`It ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it.'' I'll start with an example of my own.  

我想谈一下另一个话题。它基于一首我想你们很多人都知道的歌曲，"这不是你做什么，而是你做的方式。我将以我自己的一个例子开始。  

I was conned into doing on a digital computer, in the absolute binary days, a problem which the best analog computers couldn't do. And I was getting an answer.  

在绝对的二进制时代，我被骗到数字计算机上做一个最好的模拟计算机都做不到的问题。而我得到了一个答案。  

When I thought carefully and said to myself, \`\`You know, Hamming, you're going to have to file a report on this military job; after you spend a lot of money you're going to have to account for it and every analog installation is going to want the report to see if they can't find flaws in it.'' I was doing the required integration by a rather crummy method, to say the least, but I was getting the answer.  

当我仔细思考并对自己说："你知道，汉明，你将不得不就这项军事工作提交一份报告；在你花了很多钱之后，你将不得不对它进行说明，每个模拟装置都会想要这份报告，看看他们是否能在其中找到缺陷。至少可以说，我是用一种相当蹩脚的方法进行所需的整合，但我正在得到答案。  

And I realized that in truth the problem was not just to get the answer; it was to demonstrate for the first time, and beyond question, that I could beat the analog computer on its own ground with a digital machine.  

我意识到，事实上，问题不仅仅是要得到答案；而是要第一次毫无疑问地证明，我可以用一台数字机器在自己的地盘上击败模拟计算机。  

I reworked the method of solution, created a theory which was nice and elegant, and changed the way we computed the answer; the results were no different.  

我重新修改了解题方法，创建了一个漂亮而优雅的理论，并改变了我们计算答案的方式；结果没有什么不同。  

The published report had an elegant method which was later known for years as \`\`Hamming's Method of Integrating Differential Equations.'' It is somewhat obsolete now, but for a while it was a very good method.  

发表的报告有一个优雅的方法，后来多年来被称为 "哈明微分方程积分法"。它现在已经有些过时了，但在一段时间内，它是一种非常好的方法。  

By changing the problem slightly, I did important work rather than trivial work.  

通过稍微改变问题，我做了重要的工作而不是琐碎的工作。

In the same way, when using the machine up in the attic in the early days, I was solving one problem after another after another; a fair number were successful and there were a few failures.  

同样，在早期使用阁楼上的机器时，我在解决一个又一个的问题；有相当多的问题是成功的，也有少数失败的。  

I went home one Friday after finishing a problem, and curiously enough I wasn't happy; I was depressed. I could see life being a long sequence of one problem after another after another.  

一个星期五，我做完一个问题后回家，奇怪的是我并不高兴，我很沮丧。我可以看到生活就是一长串一个又一个的问题。  

After quite a while of thinking I decided, \`\`No, I should be in the mass production of a variable product. I should be concerned with _all_ of next year's problems, not just the one in front of my face.'' By changing the question I still got the same kind of results or better, but I changed things and did important work.  

经过相当一段时间的思考，我决定："不，我应该从事可变产品的大规模生产。我应该关注明年的所有问题，而不是只关注我眼前的问题'。通过改变问题，我仍然得到了同样的结果或更好的结果，但我改变了事情，做了重要的工作。  

I attacked the major problem - How do I conquer machines and do all of next year's problems when I don't know what they are going to be? How do I prepare for it?  

我攻克了主要问题--当我不知道明年的问题是什么时，我如何征服机器，做所有的问题？我如何准备呢？  

How do I do this one so I'll be on top of it? How do I obey Newton's rule?  

我怎样做才能在这个问题上做到游刃有余？我怎样才能遵守牛顿的规则？  

He said, \`\`If I have seen further than others, it is because I've stood on the shoulders of giants.'' These days we stand on each other's feet!  

他说："如果我比别人看得远，那是因为我站在巨人的肩膀上。这些天，我们站在彼此的脚上！"！

You should do your job in such a fashion that others can build on top of it, so they will indeed say, \`\`Yes, I've stood on so and so's shoulders and I saw further.'' The essence of science is cumulative.  

你应该以这样的方式完成你的工作，让其他人可以在此基础上再接再厉，所以他们确实会说："是的，我站在某某的肩膀上，我看得更远。科学的本质是积累。  

By changing a problem slightly you can often do great work rather than merely good work.  

通过稍微改变一个问题，你往往可以做伟大的工作，而不仅仅是好工作。  

Instead of attacking isolated problems, I made the resolution that I would never again solve an isolated problem except as characteristic of a class.  

我没有攻击孤立的问题，而是下定决心，除了作为一个班级的特点，我再也不会解决孤立的问题。

Now if you are much of a mathematician you know that the effort to generalize often means that the solution is simple.  

现在，如果你是很多数学家，你就会知道，努力归纳往往意味着解决方案很简单。  

Often by stopping and saying, \`\`This is the problem he wants but this is characteristic of so and so.  

通常是通过停下来说："这是他想要的问题，但这是某某的特点。  

Yes, I can attack the whole class with a far superior method than the particular one because I was earlier embedded in needless detail.'' The business of abstraction frequently makes things simple.  

是的，我可以用一种远比特定的方法来攻击整个类，因为我早先嵌入了不必要的细节。抽象的业务经常使事情变得简单。  

Furthermore, I filed away the methods and prepared for the future problems.  

此外，我把这些方法归档，为未来的问题做好准备。

To end this part, I'll remind you, \`\`It is a poor workman who blames his tools - the good man gets on with the job, given what he's got, and gets the best answer he can.'' And I suggest that by altering the problem, by looking at the thing differently, you can make a great deal of difference in your final productivity because you can either do it in such a fashion that people can indeed build on what you've done, or you can do it in such a fashion that the next person has to essentially duplicate again what you've done.  

在结束这一部分时，我要提醒你："指责他的工具的是一个可怜的工人--好的人继续工作，鉴于他所得到的，并得到他所能得到的最好的答案"。我建议，通过改变问题，以不同的方式看待问题，你可以在你的最终生产力上有很大的不同，因为你可以以这样的方式来做，人们确实可以在你所做的基础上发展，或者你可以以这样的方式来做，下一个人基本上必须再次复制你所做的。  

It isn't just a matter of the job, it's the way you write the report, the way you write the paper, the whole attitude. It's just as easy to do a broad, general job as one very special case.  

这不仅仅是工作的问题，而是你写报告的方式，你写论文的方式，整个态度。做一个广泛的、一般的工作和做一个非常特殊的案例一样容易。  

And it's much more satisfying and rewarding!  

而且它更令人满意，更有成就感!

I have now come down to a topic which is very distasteful; it is not sufficient to do a job, you have to sell it. \`Selling' to a scientist is an awkward thing to do.  

我现在谈到了一个非常令人厌恶的话题；仅仅做一项工作是不够的，你还得把它卖掉。向科学家 "推销 "是一件很尴尬的事情。  

It's very ugly; you shouldn't have to do it. The world is supposed to be waiting, and when you do something great, they should rush out and welcome it.  

这是非常丑陋的；你不应该这样做。世界应该是在等待，当你做一些伟大的事情时，他们应该冲出去欢迎。  

But the fact is everyone is busy with their own work.  

但事实上，每个人都在忙于自己的工作。  

You must present it so well that they will set aside what they are doing, look at what you've done, read it, and come back and say, \`\`Yes, that was good.'' I suggest that when you open a journal, as you turn the pages, you ask why you read some articles and not others.  

你必须表现得很好，让他们把正在做的事情放在一边，看看你所做的事情，读一读，然后回来说："是的，这很好"。我建议，当你打开期刊时，当你翻开书页时，你要问为什么你读了一些文章而不是其他文章。  

You had better write your report so when it is published in the Physical Review, or wherever else you want it, as the readers are turning the pages they won't just turn your pages but they will stop and read yours.  

你最好写好你的报告，这样当它在《物理评论》或其他你想发表的地方发表时，当读者翻页时，他们不会只翻你的页，而是会停下来读你的页。  

If they don't stop and read it, you won't get credit.  

如果他们不驻足阅读，你就不会得到奖励。

There are three things you have to do in selling.  

在销售中，你必须做三件事。  

You have to learn to write clearly and well so that people will read it, you must learn to give reasonably formal talks, and you also must learn to give informal talks.  

你必须学会写清楚，写好，以便人们阅读，你必须学会进行合理的正式会谈，你也必须学会进行非正式会谈。  

We had a lot of so-called \`back room scientists.' In a conference, they would keep quiet. Three weeks later after a decision was made they filed a report saying why you should do so and so.  

我们有很多所谓的 "密室科学家"。在一次会议上，他们会保持沉默。三周后，在做出决定后，他们提交一份报告，说你为什么要这样做，这样做。  

Well, it was too late.  

好吧，这已经太晚了。  

They would not stand up right in the middle of a hot conference, in the middle of activity, and say, \`\`We should do this for these reasons.'' You need to master that form of communication as well as prepared speeches.  

他们不会在热火朝天的会议中，在活动中站起来说："我们应该因为这些原因而这样做"。你需要掌握这种沟通方式，也需要掌握准备好的演讲稿。

When I first started, I got practically physically ill while giving a speech, and I was very, very nervous.  

当我刚开始的时候，我在做演讲时几乎身体不适，我非常非常紧张。  

I realized I either had to learn to give speeches smoothly or I would essentially partially cripple my whole career.  

我意识到，我必须学会顺利地进行演讲，否则我的整个职业生涯基本上就会部分瘫痪。  

The first time IBM asked me to give a speech in New York one evening, I decided I was going to give a really good speech, a speech that was wanted, not a technical one but a broad one, and at the end if they liked it, I'd quietly say, \`\`Any time you want one I'll come in and give you one.'' As a result, I got a great deal of practice giving speeches to a limited audience and I got over being afraid.  

有一天晚上，IBM第一次让我在纽约做演讲，我决定要做一个非常好的演讲，一个被人需要的演讲，不是一个技术性的演讲，而是一个广泛的演讲，最后如果他们喜欢，我会悄悄地说："任何时候你想要一个，我都会进来给你一个"。结果，我在为有限的听众做演讲方面得到了大量的练习，我也克服了害怕的心理。  

Furthermore, I could also then study what methods were effective and what were ineffective.  

此外，我还可以研究哪些方法是有效的，哪些是无效的。

While going to meetings I had already been studying why some papers are remembered and most are not. The technical person wants to give a highly limited technical talk.  

在去开会的时候，我已经在研究为什么有些论文能被记住，而大多数不能被记住。技术人员想做一个高度有限的技术讲座。  

Most of the time the audience wants a broad general talk and wants much more survey and background than the speaker is willing to give. As a result, many talks are ineffective.  

大多数时候，听众想要一个广泛的一般性谈话，并希望得到比演讲者愿意提供的更多调查和背景。因此，许多会谈是无效的。  

The speaker names a topic and suddenly plunges into the details he's solved. Few people in the audience may follow.  

演讲者说出一个主题，然后突然投入到他所解决的细节中。听众中可能很少有人跟随。  

You should paint a general picture to say why it's important, and then slowly give a sketch of what was done.  

你应该描绘出一幅大致的图画，说说为什么它很重要，然后慢慢地给出所做的事情的草图。  

Then a larger number of people will say, \`\`Yes, Joe has done that,'' or \`\`Mary has done that; I really see where it is; yes, Mary really gave a good talk; I understand what Mary has done.'' The tendency is to give a highly restricted, safe talk; this is usually ineffective.  

那么更多的人就会说："是的，乔做了这个，"或者 "玛丽做了这个；我真的看到了它的位置；是的，玛丽真的讲得很好；我明白玛丽做了什么。倾向于给出一个高度限制的、安全的谈话；这通常是无效的。  

Furthermore, many talks are filled with far too much information. So I say this idea of selling is obvious.  

此外，许多会谈都充满了太多的信息。所以我说这个销售的想法是显而易见的。

Let me summarize. You've got to work on important problems. I deny that it is all luck, but I admit there is a fair element of luck.  

让我总结一下。你得在重要问题上下功夫。我否认这都是运气，但我承认有相当的运气成分。  

I subscribe to Pasteur's \`\`Luck favors the prepared mind.'' I favor heavily what I did.  

我赞同巴斯德的 "幸运之神眷顾有准备的人"。我非常赞成我所做的事情。  

Friday afternoons for years - great thoughts only - means that I committed 10% of my time trying to understand the bigger problems in the field, i.e. what was and what was not important.  

多年来的周五下午--只有伟大的思想--意味着我投入了10%的时间，试图了解该领域的更大问题，即什么是和什么是不重要的。  

I found in the early days I had believed \`this' and yet had spent all week marching in \`that' direction. It was kind of foolish.  

我发现在早期，我相信 "这个"，但却花了整整一周的时间朝 "那个 "方向前进。这是种愚蠢的行为。  

If I really believe the action is over there, why do I march in this direction? I either had to change my goal or change what I did.  

如果我真的相信行动在那边，我为什么要向这个方向行进？我要么改变我的目标，要么改变我的做法。  

So I changed something I did and I marched in the direction I thought was important. It's that easy.  

所以我改变了我所做的一些事情，我朝着我认为重要的方向前进。就是这么简单。

Now you might tell me you haven't got control over what you have to work on. Well, when you first begin, you may not.  

现在你可能会告诉我，你没有控制好你要做的工作。好吧，当你刚开始时，你可能没有。  

But once you're moderately successful, there are more people asking for results than you can deliver and you have some power of choice, but not completely.  

但是，一旦你适度成功，要求结果的人比你能提供的更多，你有一些选择权，但不完全是。  

I'll tell you a story about that, and it bears on the subject of educating your boss. I had a boss named Schelkunoff; he was, and still is, a very good friend of mine.  

我给你讲一个故事，它关系到教育你的老板的问题。我有个老板叫Schelkunoff；他过去是，现在也是，我的一个非常好的朋友。  

Some military person came to me and demanded some answers by Friday.  

一些军事人员来找我，要求在星期五之前得到一些答案。  

Well, I had already dedicated my computing resources to reducing data on the fly for a group of scientists; I was knee deep in short, small, important problems. This military person wanted me to solve his problem by the end of the day on Friday.  

好吧，我已经把我的计算资源用于为一群科学家飞快地减少数据；我正跪在短小而重要的问题上。这位军方人士希望我在周五结束前解决他的问题。  

I said, \`\`No, I'll give it to you Monday. I can work on it over the weekend.  

我说，"不，我星期一给你。我可以在周末进行工作。  

I'm not going to do it now.'' He goes down to my boss, Schelkunoff, and Schelkunoff says, \`\`You must run this for him; he's got to have it by Friday.'' I tell him, \`\`Why do I?''; he says, \`\`You have to.'' I said, \`\`Fine, Sergei, but you're sitting in your office Friday afternoon catching the late bus home to watch as this fellow walks out that door.'' I gave the military person the answers late Friday afternoon.  

我现在不打算这样做。他去找我的老板Schelkunoff，Schelkunoff说，"你必须为他办这件事；他必须在星期五之前拿到它"。我告诉他，"为什么是我？"；他说，"你必须这样做"。我说："好吧，谢尔盖，但你周五下午坐在办公室里，赶着晚班车回家，看着这个家伙走出那扇门。我在星期五下午晚些时候给了这位军人答案。  

I then went to Schelkunoff's office and sat down; as the man goes out I say, \`\`You see Schelkunoff, this fellow has nothing under his arm; but I gave him the answers.'' On Monday morning Schelkunoff called him up and said, \`\`Did you come in to work over the weekend?'' I could hear, as it were, a pause as the fellow ran through his mind of what was going to happen; but he knew he would have had to sign in, and he'd better not say he had when he hadn't, so he said he hadn't.  

然后我去了谢尔库诺夫的办公室，坐下来；当那个人出去的时候，我说："你看谢尔库诺夫，这个家伙胳膊下什么都没有；但是我给了他答案。星期一早上，谢尔库诺夫给他打电话，说："你周末来上班了吗？我可以听到，这家伙在脑海中回想将要发生的事情时，停顿了一下；但他知道他必须签到，他最好不要在没有签到时说他签到了，所以他说他没有。  

Ever after that Schelkunoff said, \`\`You set your deadlines; you can change them.''  

此后，Schelkunoff说，"你设定了你的最后期限；你可以改变它们"。

One lesson was sufficient to educate my boss as to why I didn't want to do big jobs that displaced exploratory research and why I was justified in not doing crash jobs which absorb all the research computing facilities.  

一堂课就足以教育我的老板，为什么我不想做取代探索性研究的大工作，为什么我有理由不做吸收所有研究计算设施的崩溃工作。  

I wanted instead to use the facilities to compute a large number of small problems. Again, in the early days, I was limited in computing capacity and it was clear, in my area, that a \`\`mathematician had no use for machines.'' But I needed more machine capacity.  

我反而想利用这些设施来计算大量的小问题。同样，在早期，我的计算能力是有限的，在我的领域，很明显，"数学家对机器没有用处"。但我需要更多的机器能力。  

Every time I had to tell some scientist in some other area, \`\`No I can't; I haven't the machine capacity,'' he complained. I said \`\`Go tell _your_ Vice President that Hamming needs more computing capacity.'' After a while I could see what was happening up there at the top; many people said to my Vice President, \`\`Your man needs more computing capacity.'' I got it!  

每次我不得不告诉其他领域的一些科学家，"不，我不能，我没有机器的能力，"他抱怨道。我说："去告诉你们的副总统，汉明需要更多的计算能力"。过了一会儿，我看到上面发生了什么；许多人对我的副总统说，"你的人需要更多的计算能力"。我明白了!

I also did a second thing.  

我还做了第二件事。  

When I loaned what little programming power we had to help in the early days of computing, I said, \`\`We are not getting the recognition for our programmers that they deserve.  

当我把我们仅有的一点编程能力借给计算机早期的帮助时，我说："我们的程序员没有得到他们应有的认可。  

When you publish a paper you will thank that programmer or you aren't getting any more help from me. That programmer is going to be thanked by name; she's worked hard.'' I waited a couple of years.  

当你发表论文时，你要感谢那个程序员，否则你就不会再得到我的帮助了。''那个程序员要被点名感谢；她工作很努力。我等了好几年。  

I then went through a year of BSTJ articles and counted what fraction thanked some programmer.  

然后我翻阅了一年的BSTJ文章，数了一下哪一部分感谢了某个程序员。  

I took it into the boss and said, \`\`That's the central role computing is playing in Bell Labs; if the BSTJ is important, that's how important computing is.'' He had to give in.  

我把它带到老板那里，说："这就是计算在贝尔实验室的核心作用；如果BSTJ很重要，那就是计算有多么重要。他不得不让步。  

You can educate your bosses. It's a hard job. In this talk I'm only viewing from the bottom up; I'm not viewing from the top down.  

你可以教育你的老板们。这是一项艰苦的工作。在这次谈话中，我只是从下往上看，我没有从上往下看。  

But I am telling you how you can get what you want in spite of top management. You have to sell your ideas there also.  

但我要告诉你的是，尽管有高层管理人员，你也能得到你想要的东西。你也必须在那里推销你的想法。

Well I now come down to the topic, \`\`Is the effort to be a great scientist worth it?'' To answer this, you must ask people.  

好吧，我现在来谈谈这个话题，"成为一名伟大的科学家的努力是否值得？要回答这个问题，你必须问人。  

When you get beyond their modesty, most people will say, \`\`Yes, doing really first-class work, and knowing it, is as good as wine, women and song put together,'' or if it's a woman she says, \`\`It is as good as wine, men and song put together.'' And if you look at the bosses, they tend to come back or ask for reports, trying to participate in those moments of discovery.  

当你超越了他们的谦虚，大多数人会说："是的，做真正一流的工作，并且知道它，就像葡萄酒、女人和歌曲放在一起一样好。"如果是一个女人，她说："就像葡萄酒、男人和歌曲放在一起一样好。如果你看看老板们，他们往往回来或要求报告，试图参与这些发现的时刻。  

They're always in the way. So evidently those who have done it, want to do it again. But it is a limited survey.  

他们总是碍手碍脚。所以很明显，那些已经做过的人，想再做一次。但这是一个有限的调查。  

I have never dared to go out and ask those who didn't do great work how they felt about the matter. It's a biased sample, but I still think it is worth the struggle.  

我从来不敢出去问那些没有做伟大工作的人对这件事的感受。这是个有偏见的样本，但我仍然认为这是值得奋斗的。  

I think it is very definitely worth the struggle to try and do first-class work because the truth is, the value is in the struggle more than it is in the result.  

我认为努力做一流的工作绝对是值得的，因为事实是，价值在于奋斗，而不是结果。  

The struggle to make something of yourself seems to be worthwhile in itself. The success and fame are sort of dividends, in my opinion.  

为使自己有所作为而进行的奋斗本身似乎是值得的。在我看来，成功和名声是一种红利。

I've told you how to do it. It is so easy, so why do so many people, with all their talents, fail?  

我已经告诉你怎么做了。它是如此简单，那么为什么这么多的人，以他们的天赋，都会失败呢？  

For example, my opinion, to this day, is that there are in the mathematics department at Bell Labs quite a few people far more able and far better endowed than I, but they didn't produce as much.  

例如，我的看法是，直到今天，在贝尔实验室的数学部门，有相当多的人比我更有能力，更有天赋，但他们没有产生那么多的成果。  

Some of them did produce more than I did; Shannon produced more than I did, and some others produced a lot, but I was highly productive against a lot of other fellows who were better equipped.  

他们中的一些人确实比我的产量高；香农的产量比我高，其他一些人的产量也很高，但我的产量很高，而其他许多伙伴的装备更好。  

Why is it so? What happened to them? Why do so many of the people who have great promise, fail?  

为什么会这样呢？他们身上发生了什么？为什么这么多有大希望的人都失败了？

Well, one of the reasons is drive and commitment.  

嗯，其中一个原因是动力和承诺。  

The people who do great work with less ability but who are committed to it, get more done that those who have great skill and dabble in it, who work during the day and go home and do other things and come back and work the next day.  

那些以较低的能力做伟大的工作，但致力于此的人，比那些拥有伟大的技能并涉足其中的人做得更多，他们在白天工作，回家做其他事情，第二天再回来工作。  

They don't have the deep commitment that is apparently necessary for really first-class work. They turn out lots of good work, but we were talking, remember, about first-class work.  

他们没有深层次的承诺，而这显然是真正的一流工作所必需的。他们做了很多好的工作，但我们在谈论的是一流的工作。  

There is a difference.  

这是有区别的。  

Good people, very talented people, almost always turn out good work. We're talking about the outstanding work, the type of work that gets the Nobel Prize and gets recognition.  

优秀的人，非常有才华的人，几乎总是能做出好的作品。我们谈论的是杰出的工作，是那种获得诺贝尔奖并得到认可的工作。

The second thing is, I think, the problem of personality defects. Now I'll cite a fellow whom I met out in Irvine.  

第二件事是，我认为，人格缺陷的问题。现在我举一个我在欧文市遇到的家伙为例。  

He had been the head of a computing center and he was temporarily on assignment as a special assistant to the president of the university. It was obvious he had a job with a great future.  

他曾是一个计算中心的负责人，他暂时被指派为大学校长的特别助理。很明显，他有一份前景广阔的工作。  

He took me into his office one time and showed me his method of getting letters done and how he took care of his correspondence. He pointed out how inefficient the secretary was.  

有一次他带我到他的办公室，向我展示了他完成信件的方法，以及他如何处理他的信件。他指出了秘书的效率有多低。  

He kept all his letters stacked around there; he knew where everything was. And he would, on his word processor, get the letter out.  

他把所有的信都堆在那里；他知道所有的东西在哪里。而他会在他的文字处理器上，把信拿出来。  

He was bragging how marvelous it was and how he could get so much more work done without the secretary's interference. Well, behind his back, I talked to the secretary.  

他吹嘘说这是多么了不起的事情，没有秘书的干扰，他可以完成更多的工作。好吧，在他的背后，我和秘书谈了谈。  

The secretary said, \`\`Of course I can't help him; I don't get his mail. He won't give me the stuff to log in; I don't know where he puts it on the floor.  

秘书说："我当然不能帮他，我没有收到他的邮件。他不给我登录的东西；我不知道他把东西放在哪里。  

Of course I can't help him.'' So I went to him and said, \`\`Look, if you adopt the present method and do what you can do single-handedly, you can go just that far and no farther than you can do single-handedly.  

''当然我不能帮助他。于是我去找他，说："听着，如果你采用现在的方法，做你能单干的事，你就能走那么远，不会超过你能单干的范围。  

If you will learn to work with the system, you can go as far as the system will support you.'' And, he never went any further.  

如果你愿意学习与系统合作，你可以在系统支持你的情况下走多远。而且，他从未走得更远。  

He had his personality defect of wanting total control and was not willing to recognize that you need the support of the system.  

他有他的人格缺陷，想要完全控制，不愿意承认你需要系统的支持。

You find this happening again and again; good scientists will fight the system rather than learn to work with the system and take advantage of all the system has to offer.  

你会发现这种情况一再发生；优秀的科学家会与系统对抗，而不是学会与系统合作，并利用系统提供的所有优势。  

It has a lot, if you learn how to use it. It takes patience, but you can learn how to use the system pretty well, and you can learn how to get around it.  

它有很多，如果你学会如何使用它。这需要耐心，但你可以很好地学习如何使用这个系统，你也可以学习如何绕过它。  

After all, if you want a decision \`No', you just go to your boss and get a \`No' easy. If you want to do something, don't ask, do it. Present him with an accomplished fact.  

毕竟，如果你想要一个决定 "不"，你只要去找你的老板，就能轻松得到一个 "不"。如果你想做什么，不要问，就去做。向他提出一个已完成的事实。  

Don't give him a chance to tell you \`No'. But if you want a \`No', it's easy to get a \`No'.  

不要给他一个机会告诉你 "不"。但如果你想要一个 "不"，就很容易得到一个 "不"。

Another personality defect is ego assertion and I'll speak in this case of my own experience.  

另一个人格缺陷是自我主张，在此我要讲的是我自己的经验。  

I came from Los Alamos and in the early days I was using a machine in New York at 590 Madison Avenue where we merely rented time.  

我来自洛斯阿拉莫斯，早期我在纽约麦迪逊大道590号使用一台机器，我们只是租用了时间。  

I was still dressing in western clothes, big slash pockets, a bolo and all those things. I vaguely noticed that I was not getting as good service as other people. So I set out to measure.  

我仍然穿着西式服装，大斜线口袋，一个波洛和所有这些东西。我隐约注意到，我没有得到像其他人那样好的服务。于是我开始测量。  

You came in and you waited for your turn; I felt I was not getting a fair deal. I said to myself, \`\`Why? No Vice President at IBM said, \`Give Hamming a bad time'.  

你进来了，你等着轮到你；我觉得我没有得到公平的待遇。我对自己说，"为什么？IBM的副总裁没有说："给汉明一个不好的时机"。  

It is the secretaries at the bottom who are doing this. When a slot appears, they'll rush to find someone to slip in, but they go out and find somebody else. Now, why?  

是底层的秘书们在做这件事。当一个名额出现时，他们会急着找人溜进去，但他们又出去找别人。现在，为什么？  

I haven't mistreated them.'' Answer, I wasn't dressing the way they felt somebody in that situation should. It came down to just that - I wasn't dressing properly.  

我没有虐待他们'。回答是，我没有按照他们认为在那种情况下的人应该有的方式穿衣服。归根结底就是--我的穿着不合适。  

I had to make the decision - was I going to assert my ego and dress the way I wanted to and have it steadily drain my effort from my professional life, or was I going to appear to conform better?  

我必须做出决定--我是要坚持我的自我，按照我想要的方式打扮，并让它不断地消耗我在职业生活中的努力，还是要让我看起来更符合要求？  

I decided I would make an effort to appear to conform properly. The moment I did, I got much better service. And now, as an old colorful character, I get better service than other people.  

我决定我将努力使自己看起来符合要求。当我这样做的时候，我得到了更好的服务。而现在，作为一个多姿多彩的老人物，我得到的服务比其他人更好。

You should dress according to the expectations of the audience spoken to.  

你应该根据说话对象的期望来穿着。  

If I am going to give an address at the MIT computer center, I dress with a bolo and an old corduroy jacket or something else.  

如果我要在麻省理工学院的计算机中心发表演讲，我就会穿上博洛尼亚和一件旧灯芯绒夹克或其他东西。  

I know enough not to let my clothes, my appearance, my manners get in the way of what I care about. An enormous number of scientists feel they must assert their ego and do their thing their way.  

我知道不能让我的衣服、我的外表、我的举止妨碍我关心的事情。大量的科学家认为他们必须坚持自我，以自己的方式做自己的事情。  

They have got to be able to do this, that, or the other thing, and they pay a steady price.  

他们必须能够做这个、那个或其他事情，而且他们付出了稳定的代价。

John Tukey almost always dressed very casually.  

约翰-图基几乎总是穿得很随便。  

He would go into an important office and it would take a long time before the other fellow realized that this is a first-class man and he had better listen.  

他将进入一个重要的办公室，过了很久，对方才意识到这是一个一流的人，他最好听从。  

For a long time John has had to overcome this kind of hostility. It's wasted effort! I didn't say you should conform; I said \`\`The _appearance of conforming_ gets you a long way.'' If you chose to assert your ego in any number of ways, \`\`I am going to do it my way,'' you pay a small steady price throughout the whole of your professional career.  

长期以来，约翰不得不克服这种敌意。这是白费力气!我没有说你应该顺从；我说\`\`顺从的外表会让你走得更远。如果你选择以任何一种方式来宣扬你的自我，\`我将以我的方式来做，'你在整个职业生涯中都要付出稳定的小代价。  

And this, over a whole lifetime, adds up to an enormous amount of needless trouble.  

而这，在整个一生中，加起来就是一个巨大的不必要的麻烦。

By taking the trouble to tell jokes to the secretaries and being a little friendly, I got superb secretarial help.  

通过不厌其烦地给秘书们讲笑话和表现出一点友好，我得到了一流的秘书帮助。  

For instance, one time for some idiot reason all the reproducing services at Murray Hill were tied up. Don't ask me how, but they were. I wanted something done.  

例如，有一次由于一些白痴的原因，默里山的所有复制服务都被占用了。不要问我是怎么做到的，但他们就是这样。我想做一些事情。  

My secretary called up somebody at Holmdel, hopped the company car, made the hour-long trip down and got it reproduced, and then came back.  

我的秘书给霍尔姆德尔的人打电话，跳上公司的车，跑了一个小时的路程，把它复制出来，然后再回来。  

It was a payoff for the times I had made an effort to cheer her up, tell her jokes and be friendly; it was that little extra work that later paid off for me.  

这是对我努力让她开心、给她讲笑话和友好的回报；正是这一点额外的工作，后来为我带来了回报。  

By realizing you have to use the system and studying how to get the system to do your work, you learn how to adapt the system to your desires.  

通过意识到你必须使用这个系统并研究如何让这个系统完成你的工作，你学会了如何使这个系统适应你的愿望。  

Or you can fight it steadily, as a small undeclared war, for the whole of your life.  

或者你可以稳定地与之斗争，作为一场不宣而战的小战争，在你的一生中。

And I think John Tukey paid a terrible price needlessly.  

而我认为约翰-图克无谓地付出了可怕的代价。  

He was a genius anyhow, but I think it would have been far better, and far simpler, had he been willing to conform a little bit instead of ego asserting.  

无论如何，他是个天才，但我认为如果他愿意顺应一下，而不是自我主张，那会好得多，也简单得多。  

He is going to dress the way he wants all of the time. It applies not only to dress but to a thousand other things; people will continue to fight the system. Not that you shouldn't occasionally!  

他要一直按照自己的方式来穿衣服。这不仅适用于穿着，也适用于其他一千件事情；人们将继续与这个系统作斗争。不是说你不应该偶尔!

When they moved the library from the middle of Murray Hill to the far end, a friend of mine put in a request for a bicycle. Well, the organization was not dumb.  

当他们把图书馆从默里山的中间搬到远端时，我的一个朋友提出了一个自行车的要求。嗯，该组织并不笨。  

They waited awhile and sent back a map of the grounds saying, \`\`Will you please indicate on this map what paths you are going to take so we can get an insurance policy covering you.'' A few more weeks went by.  

他们等了一段时间，发回了一张地图，说："请你在这张地图上标明你要走的路，这样我们就可以为你买一份保险了"。又过了几个星期。  

They then asked, \`\`Where are you going to store the bicycle and how will it be locked so we can do so and so.'' He finally realized that of course he was going to be red-taped to death so he gave in.  

他们接着问："你打算把自行车存放在哪里，如何锁住它，以便我们可以做这样那样的事情。他终于意识到，他当然会被用红胶带绑死，所以他屈服了。  

He rose to be the President of Bell Laboratories.  

他晋升为贝尔实验室的总裁。

Barney Oliver was a good man. He wrote a letter one time to the IEEE.  

巴尼-奥利弗是个好人。他有一次给IEEE写了一封信。  

At that time the official shelf space at Bell Labs was so much and the height of the IEEE Proceedings at that time was larger; and since you couldn't change the size of the official shelf space he wrote this letter to the IEEE Publication person saying, \`\`Since so many IEEE members were at Bell Labs and since the official space was so high the journal size should be changed.'' He sent it for his boss's signature.  

当时贝尔实验室的官方书架空间非常大，而当时IEEE论文集的高度也比较大；由于你不能改变官方书架空间的大小，他给IEEE出版人员写了这封信，说："由于这么多IEEE成员在贝尔实验室，而且官方空间这么高，期刊的尺寸应该改变。他把这封信送给了他的老板签字。  

Back came a carbon with his signature, but he still doesn't know whether the original was sent or not. I am not saying you shouldn't make gestures of reform.  

回来的是有他签名的复写本，但他仍然不知道原件是否已经寄出。我并不是说你不应该做出改革的姿态。  

I am saying that my study of able people is that they don't get themselves _committed_ to that kind of warfare. They play it a little bit and drop it and get on with their work.  

我是说，我对能人的研究是，他们不会让自己投入到那种战争中。他们稍微玩一下，然后放下，继续工作。

Many a second-rate fellow gets caught up in some little twitting of the system, and carries it through to warfare. He expends his energy in a foolish project.  

许多二流的人陷入了对制度的一些小的嘲弄中，并把它带到了战争中。他在一个愚蠢的项目中耗费了他的精力。  

Now you are going to tell me that somebody has to change the system. I agree; somebody's has to. Which do you want to be? The person who changes the system or the person who does first-class science?  

现在你要告诉我，有人必须改变这个系统。我同意；有人的必须。你想成为哪一个？改变制度的人还是做一流科学的人？

Which person is it that you want to be?  

你想成为哪个人？  

Be clear, when you fight the system and struggle with it, what you are doing, how far to go out of amusement, and how much to waste your effort fighting the system.  

要清楚，当你与系统斗争时，你在做什么，在多大程度上脱离娱乐，以及在多大程度上浪费你的精力与系统斗争。  

My advice is to let somebody else do it and you get on with becoming a first-class scientist. Very few of you have the ability to both reform the system _and_ become a first-class scientist.  

我的建议是，让别人去做，你继续成为一流的科学家。你们中很少有人有能力既改革制度又成为一流的科学家。

On the other hand, we can't always give in. There are times when a certain amount of rebellion is sensible.  

另一方面，我们也不能总是屈服。有些时候，某种程度的反叛是明智的。  

I have observed almost all scientists enjoy a certain amount of twitting the system for the sheer love of it.  

我观察到，几乎所有的科学家都喜欢在一定程度上对系统进行推理，因为他们纯粹是为了爱。  

What it comes down to basically is that you cannot be original in one area without having originality in others. Originality is being different.  

基本上，它归结为：如果你在一个领域没有原创性，就不能在其他领域有原创性。原创性就是与众不同。  

You can't be an original scientist without having some other original characteristics.  

如果不具备其他一些原创性特征，你就不可能成为一个原创性的科学家。  

But many a scientist has let his quirks in other places make him pay a far higher price than is necessary for the ego satisfaction he or she gets.  

但许多科学家在其他地方让自己的怪癖使他付出了远高于自我满足所需的代价。  

I'm not against all ego assertion; I'm against some.  

我并不反对所有的自我主张；我反对一些主张。

Another fault is anger. Often a scientist becomes angry, and this is no way to handle things. Amusement, yes, anger, no. Anger is misdirected.  

另一个错误是愤怒。科学家往往会变得愤怒，这不是处理事情的方法。娱乐，是的，愤怒，不是。愤怒的方向是错误的。  

You should follow and cooperate rather than struggle against the system all the time.  

你应该遵循和合作，而不是一直在与系统斗争。

Another thing you should look for is the positive side of things instead of the negative.  

你应该寻找的另一件事是事情的积极方面而不是消极方面。  

I have already given you several examples, and there are many, many more; how, given the situation, by changing the way I looked at it, I converted what was apparently a defect to an asset.  

我已经给你们举了几个例子，还有很多很多；在给定的情况下，我如何通过改变看待它的方式，将明显的缺陷转化为资产。  

I'll give you another example. I am an egotistical person; there is no doubt about it. I knew that most people who took a sabbatical to write a book, didn't finish it on time.  

我再给你举个例子。我是一个自负的人，这一点毋庸置疑。我知道，大多数人休假写书，都没有按时完成。  

So before I left, I told all my friends that when I come back, that book was going to be done! Yes, I would have it done - I'd have been ashamed to come back without it!  

所以在我离开之前，我告诉我所有的朋友，当我回来的时候，那本书一定要完成！是的，我会完成它--如果没有它，我就会感到羞愧！是的，我会把它完成的--如果没有它，我就会羞于回来!  

I used my ego to make myself behave the way I wanted to. I bragged about something so I'd have to perform. I found out many times, like a cornered rat in a real trap, I was surprisingly capable.  

我利用我的自我，使自己表现出我想要的方式。我吹嘘一些东西，这样我就不得不去表演。我发现很多时候，就像一只被逼到墙角的老鼠在一个真正的陷阱里一样，我的能力令人惊讶。  

I have found that it paid to say, \`\`Oh yes, I'll get the answer for you Tuesday,'' not having any idea how to do it.  

我发现说："哦，是的，我周二会给你答案的，''但不知道怎么做。  

By Sunday night I was really hard thinking on how I was going to deliver by Tuesday.  

到了周日晚上，我真的很努力地思考如何在周二之前交货。  

I often put my pride on the line and sometimes I failed, but as I said, like a cornered rat I'm surprised how often I did a good job. I think you need to learn to use yourself.  

我经常把我的自尊心放在第一位，有时我也会失败，但正如我所说，就像一只被逼到墙角的老鼠，我很惊讶我经常做得很好。我认为你需要学会利用自己。  

I think you need to know how to convert a situation from one view to another which would increase the chance of success.  

我认为你需要知道如何将一种情况从一种观点转换为另一种观点，这将增加成功的机会。

Now self-delusion in humans is very, very common. There are enumerable ways of you changing a thing and kidding yourself and making it look some other way.  

现在，人类的自我欺骗是非常、非常普遍的。你有无数种方法来改变一件事，欺骗你自己，使它看起来有一些其他的方式。  

When you ask, \`\`Why didn't you do such and such,'' the person has a thousand alibis.  

当你问："你为什么不做这样那样的事？"这个人有无数的不在场证明。  

If you look at the history of science, usually these days there are 10 people right there ready, and we pay off for the person who is there first.  

如果你看一下科学的历史，通常这些天有10个人就在那里准备好了，我们为第一个在那里的人付出了代价。  

The other nine fellows say, \`\`Well, I had the idea but I didn't do it and so on and so on.'' There are so many alibis. Why weren't you first? Why didn't you do it right? Don't try an alibi.  

其他九个人说："嗯，我有这个想法，但我没有做，等等。有这么多的不在场证明。为什么你不是第一个？为什么你没有做对？不要尝试不在场证明。  

Don't try and kid yourself. You can tell other people all the alibis you want. I don't mind. But to yourself try to be honest.  

不要试图欺骗自己。你可以告诉其他人你想要的所有不在场证明。我并不介意。但对你自己来说，要尽量诚实。

If you really want to be a first-class scientist you need to know yourself, your weaknesses, your strengths, and your bad faults, like my egotism. How can you convert a fault to an asset?  

如果你真的想成为一流的科学家，你需要了解你自己，你的弱点，你的优点，以及你的坏毛病，比如我的自负。你怎么能把缺点转化为资产呢？  

How can you convert a situation where you haven't got enough manpower to move into a direction when that's exactly what you need to do?  

当你没有足够的人力来推动一个方向时，你如何能将这种情况转换为你需要做的事情？  

I say again that I have seen, as I studied the history, the successful scientist changed the viewpoint and what was a defect became an asset.  

我再说一遍，我在研究历史时看到，成功的科学家改变了观点，原来的缺陷变成了资产。

In summary, I claim that some of the reasons why so many people who have greatness within their grasp don't succeed are: they don't work on important problems, they don't become emotionally involved, they don't try and change what is difficult to some other situation which is easily done but is still important, and they keep giving themselves alibis why they don't.  

综上所述，我宣称，许多人在掌握了伟大的成就之后却没有成功的一些原因是：他们不在重要的问题上下功夫，不在感情上投入，不尝试把困难的事情改变成其他容易做到但仍然重要的情况，而且他们不断给自己找借口，说明他们没有做到。  

They keep saying that it is a matter of luck. I've told you how easy it is; furthermore I've told you how to reform. Therefore, go forth and become great scientists!  

他们一直说这是一个运气问题。我已经告诉你们这有多容易；此外，我还告诉你们如何改革。因此，去吧，成为伟大的科学家!

(End of the formal part of the talk.)  

(谈话的正式部分结束。)

**DISCUSSION - QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  

讨论 - 问题和答案**

_A. G. Chynoweth:_ Well that was 50 minutes of concentrated wisdom and observations accumulated over a fantastic career; I lost track of all the observations that were striking home. Some of them are very very timely.  

A.G. Chynoweth： 好吧，那是50分钟的集中智慧和在一个奇妙的职业生涯中积累的观察；我失去了对所有引人注目的观察的追踪。其中一些是非常非常及时的。  

One was the plea for more computer capacity; I was hearing nothing but that this morning from several people, over and over again.  

一个是对更多计算机容量的恳求；今天上午，我从几个人那里听到的只是这个问题，一遍又一遍。  

So that was right on the mark today even though here we are 20 - 30 years after when you were making similar remarks, Dick.  

因此，这句话今天是正确的，尽管我们现在是在你发表类似言论的20-30年后，迪克。  

I can think of all sorts of lessons that all of us can draw from your talk. And for one, as I walk around the halls in the future I hope I won't see as many closed doors in Bellcore.  

我可以想到我们所有人都可以从你的谈话中吸取各种教训。其中，当我将来在大厅里走动时，我希望我不会在Bellcore看到那么多关闭的门。  

That was one observation I thought was very intriguing.  

这是我认为非常耐人寻味的一个观察。

Thank you very, very much indeed Dick; that was a wonderful recollection. I'll now open it up for questions.  

确实非常感谢你，迪克；那是一段美妙的回忆。现在我将开放给大家提问。  

I'm sure there are many people who would like to take up on some of the points that Dick was making.  

我相信有很多人愿意接受迪克提出的一些观点。

_Hamming:_ First let me respond to Alan Chynoweth about computing. I had computing in research and for 10 years I kept telling my management, \`\`Get that !&@#% machine out of research.  

汉明： 首先让我回应一下Alan Chynoweth关于计算的问题。我在研究中使用了计算机，10年来，我一直告诉我的管理层："把那台机器从研究中拿出来。  

We are being forced to run problems all the time. We can't do research because were too busy operating and running the computing machines.'' Finally the message got through.  

我们被迫一直在运行问题。我们不能做研究，因为我们太忙于操作和运行计算机。'"最后，这个消息被传达了出来。  

They were going to move computing out of research to someplace else.  

他们打算把计算从研究中移到其他地方。  

I was persona non grata to say the least and I was surprised that people didn't kick my shins because everybody was having their toy taken away from them.  

至少可以说我是不受欢迎的人，我很惊讶人们没有踢我的小腿，因为每个人都被夺走了他们的玩具。  

I went in to Ed David's office and said, \`\`Look Ed, you've got to give your researchers a machine.  

我走进埃德-戴维的办公室，说："听着，埃德，你必须给你的研究人员一台机器。  

If you give them a great big machine, we'll be back in the same trouble we were before, so busy keeping it going we can't think.  

如果你给他们一个巨大的机器，我们就会回到以前的麻烦中，忙着维持它的运转，无法思考。  

Give them the smallest machine you can because they are very able people.  

给他们最小的机器，因为他们是非常能干的人。  

They will learn how to do things on a small machine instead of mass computing.'' As far as I'm concerned, that's how UNIX arose.  

他们将学习如何在小型机器上做事情，而不是大规模计算。就我而言，这就是UNIX的产生过程。  

We gave them a moderately small machine and they decided to make it do great things. They had to come up with a system to do it on. It is called UNIX!  

我们给了他们一台中等规模的机器，他们决定让它做伟大的事情。他们不得不想出一个系统来做这件事。这就是所谓的UNIX!

_A. G. Chynoweth:_ I just have to pick up on that one.  

A.G. Chynoweth： 我只是要接一下这个问题。  

In our present environment, Dick, while we wrestle with some of the red tape attributed to, or required by, the regulators, there is one quote that one exasperated AVP came up with and I've used it over and over again.  

在我们目前的环境中，迪克，当我们与一些归因于监管机构或由监管机构要求的繁文缛节搏斗时，有一句话是一位气急败坏的AVP想出来的，我已经反复使用它。

He growled that, \`\`UNIX was never a deliverable!''  

他咆哮着说："UNIX从来都不是一个可交付的产品！

_Question:_ What about personal stress? Does that seem to make a difference?  

问题： 个人压力如何？这似乎会产生影响吗？

_Hamming:_ Yes, it does. If you don't get emotionally involved, it doesn't. I had incipient ulcers most of the years that I was at Bell Labs.  

汉明： 是的，它是。如果你不投入感情，它就不会。我在贝尔实验室工作的大部分时间里都有初起的溃疡。  

I have since gone off to the Naval Postgraduate School and laid back somewhat, and now my health is much better. But if you want to be a great scientist you're going to have to put up with stress.  

后来我去了海军研究生院，多少有些放松，现在我的健康状况好多了。但如果你想成为一名伟大的科学家，你就必须忍受压力。  

You can lead a nice life; you can be a nice guy or you can be a great scientist. But nice guys end last, is what Leo Durocher said.  

你可以过一种美好的生活；你可以成为一个好人，也可以成为一个伟大的科学家。但好人最后才会结束，这是利奥-杜罗切说的。  

If you want to lead a nice happy life with a lot of recreation and everything else, you'll lead a nice life.  

如果你想过上美好的幸福生活，有很多娱乐活动和其他一切，你会过上美好的生活。

_Question:_ The remarks about having courage, no one could argue with; but those of us who have gray hairs or who are well established don't have to worry too much.  

问题： 关于有勇气的言论，没有人可以反驳；但我们这些有白发的人或有地位的人就不用太担心。  

But what I sense among the young people these days is a real concern over the risk taking in a highly competitive environment. Do you have any words of wisdom on this?  

但我在这些天的年轻人中感觉到的是对在高度竞争的环境中承担风险的真正担忧。你对此有什么好的建议吗？

_Hamming:_ I'll quote Ed David more. Ed David was concerned about the general loss of nerve in our society. It does seem to me that we've gone through various periods.  

汉明： 我再引用一下艾德-戴维的话。埃德-戴维对我们社会中普遍丧失的神经感到担忧。在我看来，我们确实经历了不同的时期。  

Coming out of the war, coming out of Los Alamos where we built the bomb, coming out of building the radars and so on, there came into the mathematics department, and the research area, a group of people with a lot of guts.  

从战争中走出来，从我们制造炸弹的洛斯阿拉莫斯走出来，从制造雷达等走出来，数学系和研究领域出现了一群有很大胆量的人。  

They've just seen things done; they've just won a war which was fantastic. We had reasons for having courage and therefore we did a great deal. I can't arrange that situation to do it again.  

他们刚刚看到事情完成；他们刚刚赢得了一场战争，这真是太棒了。我们有理由有勇气，因此我们做了大量的工作。我不能安排那种情况再去做。  

I cannot blame the present generation for not having it, but I agree with what you say; I just cannot attach blame to it.  

我不能责怪这一代人没有，但我同意你所说的，我只是不能把责任归咎于它。  

It doesn't seem to me they have the desire for greatness; they lack the courage to do it.  

在我看来，他们似乎没有追求伟大的愿望；他们缺乏勇气去做。  

But we had, because we were in a favorable circumstance to have it; we just came through a tremendously successful war.  

但是我们有，因为我们处在一个有利的环境中；我们刚刚经历了一场巨大的成功的战争。  

In the war we were looking very, very bad for a long while; it was a very desperate struggle as you well know.  

在战争中，我们有很长一段时间看起来非常非常糟糕；正如你所知道的，这是一场非常绝望的斗争。  

And our success, I think, gave us courage and self confidence; that's why you see, beginning in the late forties through the fifties, a tremendous productivity at the labs which was stimulated from the earlier times.  

我认为，我们的成功给了我们勇气和自信心；这就是为什么你看到，从四十年代末到五十年代，实验室有了巨大的生产力，这是从早期就开始刺激的。  

Because many of us were earlier forced to learn other things - we were forced to learn the things we didn't want to learn, we were forced to have an open door - and then we could exploit those things we learned.  

因为我们中的许多人早先被迫学习其他东西--我们被迫学习我们不想学习的东西，我们被迫有一个开放的大门--然后我们可以利用我们学到的那些东西。  

It is true, and I can't do anything about it; I cannot blame the present generation either. It's just a fact.  

这是事实，我对此无能为力；我也不能责怪这一代人。这只是一个事实。

_Question:_ Is there something management could or should do?  

问题： 管理层是否可以或应该做些什么？

_Hamming:_ Management can do very little. If you want to talk about managing research, that's a totally different talk. I'd take another hour doing that.  

汉明： 管理层能做的很少。如果你想谈论管理研究，那是一个完全不同的话题。我还要花一个小时来做这个。  

This talk is about how the individual gets very successful research done in spite of anything the management does or in spite of any other opposition. And how do you do it?  

这个讲座是关于个人如何在管理层做任何事情的情况下，或者在任何其他反对意见的情况下，完成非常成功的研究。那么你是如何做到的呢？  

Just as I observe people doing it. It's just that simple and that hard!  

就像我观察人们做的那样。就是这么简单，这么难!

_Question:_ Is brainstorming a daily process?  

问题： 脑力激荡是一个日常过程吗？

_Hamming:_ Once that was a very popular thing, but it seems not to have paid off. For myself I find it desirable to talk to other people; but a session of brainstorming is seldom worthwhile.  

汉明： 曾经那是一件非常流行的事情，但似乎并没有得到回报。对我自己来说，我发现与其他人交谈是可取的；但一场头脑风暴却很少有价值。  

I do go in to strictly talk to somebody and say, \`\`Look, I think there has to be something here. Here's what I think I see ...'' and then begin talking back and forth.  

我确实去严格地与某人交谈，并说："听着，我认为这里一定有什么东西。这是我认为我看到的......'，然后开始来回交谈。  

But you want to pick capable people. To use another analogy, you know the idea called the \`critical mass.' If you have enough stuff you have critical mass.  

但你想挑选有能力的人。用另一个比喻来说，你知道有一个想法叫做 "临界质量"。如果你有足够的东西，你就有临界质量。  

There is also the idea I used to call \`sound absorbers'.  

还有一个我曾经称之为 "吸声器 "的想法。  

When you get too many sound absorbers, you give out an idea and they merely say, \`\`Yes, yes, yes.'' What you want to do is get that critical mass in action; \`\`Yes, that reminds me of so and so,'' or, \`\`Have you thought about that or this?'' When you talk to other people, you want to get rid of those sound absorbers who are nice people but merely say, \`\`Oh yes,'' and to find those who will stimulate you right back.  

当你有太多的吸音者时，你提出一个想法，他们只是说："是的，是的，是的"。你要做的是在行动中获得这种临界质量；\`是的，这让我想起了某某，'或者，\`你有没有想过这个或这个？当你与其他人交谈时，你想摆脱那些吸音者，他们是好人，但只是说："哦，是的"，并找到那些会刺激你的人。

For example, you couldn't talk to John Pierce without being stimulated very quickly. There were a group of other people I used to talk with.  

例如，你和约翰-皮尔斯谈话时不能不很快受到刺激。还有一群人曾经和我交谈过。  

For example there was Ed Gilbert; I used to go down to his office regularly and ask him questions and listen and come back stimulated.  

例如，埃德-吉尔伯特；我过去经常去他的办公室，向他提问，听他说，回来后受到刺激。  

I picked my people carefully with whom I did or whom I didn't brainstorm because the sound absorbers are a curse.  

我小心翼翼地挑选我的人，我与谁做或不与谁做头脑风暴，因为吸音机是个祸害。  

They are just nice guys; they fill the whole space and they contribute nothing except they absorb ideas and the new ideas just die away instead of echoing on.  

他们只是好人；他们填满了整个空间，除了吸收想法，他们没有任何贡献，而新的想法只是消失了，而不是继续回响。  

Yes, I find it necessary to talk to people.  

是的，我发现有必要与人交谈。  

I think people with closed doors fail to do this so they fail to get their ideas sharpened, such as \`\`Did you ever notice something over here?'' I never knew anything about it - I can go over and look.  

我认为闭门造车的人没能做到这一点，所以他们的想法没能得到磨练，比如 "你有没有注意到这边的东西？我从来都不知道这个东西--我可以过去看看。  

Somebody points the way. On my visit here, I have already found several books that I must read when I get home.  

有人指明了方向。在这里访问时，我已经发现了几本书，回家后一定要读一读。  

I talk to people and ask questions when I think they can answer me and give me clues that I do not know about. I go out and look!  

我与人交谈，当我认为他们能回答我并给我提供我所不知道的线索时，我就会问问题。我走出去看!

_Question:_ What kind of tradeoffs did you make in allocating your time for reading and writing and actually doing research?  

问题： 在分配阅读和写作的时间以及实际做研究时，你做了什么样的权衡？

_Hamming:_ I believed, in my early days, that you should spend at least as much time in the polish and presentation as you did in the original research.  

汉明： 我相信，在我的早期，你至少应该花同样多的时间在润色和展示上，就像你在原始研究上一样。  

Now at least 50% of the time must go for the presentation. It's a big, big number.  

现在至少有50%的时间必须去做演讲。这是一个很大很大的数字。

_Question:_ How much effort should go into library work?  

问题： 在图书馆工作中应该付出多少努力？

_Hamming:_ It depends upon the field. I will say this about it. There was a fellow at Bell Labs, a very, very, smart guy. He was always in the library; he read everything.  

汉明： 这取决于该领域。关于这一点，我想说的是。在贝尔实验室有一个研究员，一个非常、非常、聪明的家伙。他总是在图书馆；他阅读所有的东西。  

If you wanted references, you went to him and he gave you all kinds of references.  

如果你想要推荐信，你去找他，他给你各种推荐信。  

But in the middle of forming these theories, I formed a proposition: there would be no effect named after him in the long run. He is now retired from Bell Labs and is an Adjunct Professor.  

但在形成这些理论的过程中，我形成了一个命题：从长远来看，不会有以他命名的效应。他现在已经从贝尔实验室退休，是一名兼职教授。  

He was very valuable; I'm not questioning that. He wrote some very good Physical Review articles; but there's no effect named after him because he read too much.  

他非常有价值；我不是在质疑这一点。他写了一些非常好的《物理评论》文章；但没有以他命名的效果，因为他读得太多了。  

If you read all the time what other people have done you will think the way they thought.  

如果你一直阅读其他人的作品，你就会按照他们的想法去思考。  

If you want to think new thoughts that are different, then do what a lot of creative people do - get the problem reasonably clear and then refuse to look at any answers until you've thought the problem through carefully how you would do it, how you could slightly change the problem to be the correct one.  

如果你想想出与众不同的新想法，那么就像很多有创造力的人所做的那样--把问题合理地弄清楚，然后拒绝看任何答案，直到你把问题仔细想清楚，你会怎么做，你怎么能稍微改变问题，成为正确的答案。  

So yes, you need to keep up. You need to keep up more to find out what the problems are than to read to find the solutions. The reading is necessary to know what is going on and what is possible.  

因此，是的，你需要跟上。你需要跟上，更多的是为了找出问题所在，而不是通过阅读来找到解决方案。阅读是必要的，以了解正在发生的事情和可能发生的事情。  

But reading to get the solutions does not seem to be the way to do great research. So I'll give you two answers.  

但通过阅读来获得解决方案似乎并不是做伟大研究的方式。所以我给你两个答案。  

You read; but it is not the amount, it is the way you read that counts.  

你阅读；但重要的不是数量，而是你的阅读方式。

_Question:_ How do you get your name attached to things?  

问题： 你是如何让你的名字附在事情上的？

_Hamming:_ By doing great work. I'll tell you the hamming window one. I had given Tukey a hard time, quite a few times, and I got a phone call from him from Princeton to me at Murray Hill.  

汉明： 通过做伟大的工作。我给你讲讲汉明窗的那件事。我曾给Tukey出过难题，相当多的时候，我接到他从普林斯顿给我打来的电话，在Murray Hill。  

I knew that he was writing up power spectra and he asked me if I would mind if he called a certain window a \`\`Hamming window.'' And I said to him, \`\`Come on, John; you know perfectly well I did only a small part of the work but you also did a lot.'' He said, \`\`Yes, Hamming, but you contributed a lot of small things; you're entitled to some credit.'' So he called it the hamming window.  

我知道他在写功率谱，他问我是否介意他把某个窗口称为 "汉明窗口"。我对他说："别这样，约翰；你很清楚，我只做了一小部分工作，但你也做了很多。他说："是的，汉明，但你也做了很多小事；你有权得到一些荣誉。所以他把它称为汉明窗。  

Now, let me go on. I had twitted John frequently about true greatness. I said true greatness is when your name is like ampere, watt, and fourier - when it's spelled with a lower case letter.  

现在，让我继续说下去。我曾经常对约翰说起真正的伟大。我说真正的伟大是当你的名字像安培、瓦特和傅里叶一样--当它用小写字母拼写时。  

That's how the hamming window came about.  

这就是火腿肠窗口的由来。

_Question:_ Dick, would you care to comment on the relative effectiveness between giving talks, writing papers, and writing books?  

问题： 迪克，你是否愿意评论一下发表演讲、写论文和写书之间的相对有效性？

_Hamming:_ In the short-haul, papers are very important if you want to stimulate someone tomorrow.  

汉明： 在短期内，如果你想在明天刺激到某人，论文是非常重要的。  

If you want to get recognition long-haul, it seems to me writing books is more contribution because most of us need orientation.  

如果你想获得长期的认可，在我看来，写书的贡献更大，因为我们大多数人都需要定位。  

In this day of practically infinite knowledge, we need orientation to find our way. Let me tell you what infinite knowledge is.  

在这个几乎拥有无限知识的时代，我们需要定位来找到我们的方向。让我告诉你什么是无限的知识。  

Since from the time of Newton to now, we have come close to doubling knowledge every 17 years, more or less. And we cope with that, essentially, by specialization.  

从牛顿时代到现在，我们已经接近于每17年将知识增加一倍，或多或少。而我们基本上是通过专业化来应对这种情况的。  

In the next 340 years at that rate, there will be 20 doublings, i.e. a million, and there will be a million fields of specialty for every one field now. It isn't going to happen.  

按照这个速度，在未来340年里，将有20个倍增，即100万个，现在的每一个领域将有100万个专业领域。这是不可能的。  

The present growth of knowledge will choke itself off until we get different tools.  

目前的知识增长将扼杀自己，直到我们得到不同的工具。  

I believe that books which try to digest, coordinate, get rid of the duplication, get rid of the less fruitful methods and present the underlying ideas clearly of what we know now, will be the things the future generations will value.  

我相信，那些试图消化、协调、摆脱重复、摆脱不太有成效的方法并清楚地介绍我们现在所知道的基本思想的书籍，将是后代所重视的东西。  

Public talks are necessary; private talks are necessary; written papers are necessary.  

公开会谈是必要的；私人会谈是必要的；书面文件是必要的。  

But I am inclined to believe that, in the long-haul, books which leave out what's not essential are more important than books which tell you everything because you don't want to know everything.  

但我倾向于相信，从长远来看，那些遗漏了不重要的东西的书比那些告诉你一切的书更重要，因为你并不想知道一切。  

I don't want to know that much about penguins is the usual reply. You just want to know the essence.  

我不想知道那么多关于企鹅的事情，这是通常的回答。你只想知道本质。

_Question:_ You mentioned the problem of the Nobel Prize and the subsequent notoriety of what was done to some of the careers. Isn't that kind of a much more broad problem of fame? What can one do?  

问题： 你提到了诺贝尔奖的问题，以及随后对一些职业的恶名。这不是一种更广泛的名声问题吗？一个人可以做什么？

_Hamming:_ Some things you could do are the following. Somewhere around every seven years make a significant, if not complete, shift in your field.  

汉明： 你可以做以下一些事情。大约每七年在你的领域中进行一次重大的、甚至是彻底的转变。  

Thus, I shifted from numerical analysis, to hardware, to software, and so on, periodically, because you tend to use up your ideas. When you go to a new field, you have to start over as a baby.  

因此，我从数值分析转向硬件，再转向软件，等等，周期性地转变，因为你往往会用完你的想法。当你去一个新的领域时，你必须作为一个婴儿重新开始。  

You are no longer the big mukity muk and you can start back there and you can start planting those acorns which will become the giant oaks. Shannon, I believe, ruined himself.  

你不再是大木头了，你可以从那里开始，你可以开始种植那些橡子，这些橡子将成为巨橡。香农，我相信，他毁了自己。  

In fact when he left Bell Labs, I said, \`\`That's the end of Shannon's scientific career.'' I received a lot of flak from my friends who said that Shannon was just as smart as ever.  

事实上，当他离开贝尔实验室时，我说："这就是香农的科学生涯的结束。我收到了很多朋友的责备，他们说，香农还是和以前一样聪明。  

I said, \`\`Yes, he'll be just as smart, but that's the end of his scientific career,'' and I truly believe it was.  

我说："是的，他也会一样聪明，但这是他科学生涯的终点，"我真的相信是这样。

You have to change. You get tired after a while; you use up your originality in one field. You need to get something nearby.  

你必须改变。一段时间后你会感到疲倦；你在一个领域用完了你的原创性。你需要得到附近的东西。  

I'm not saying that you shift from music to theoretical physics to English literature; I mean within your field you should shift areas so that you don't go stale.  

我不是说你从音乐转向理论物理学，再转向英国文学；我的意思是在你的领域内，你应该转移领域，这样你才不会变质。  

You couldn't get away with forcing a change every seven years, but if you could, I would require a condition for doing research, being that you _will_ change your field of research every seven years with a reasonable definition of what it means, or at the end of 10 years, management has the right to compel you to change.  

你不可能每七年强制改变一次，但如果你可以，我会要求做研究的条件，就是你每七年改变你的研究领域，并对它的含义做出合理的定义，否则在十年结束时，管理层有权强制你改变。  

I would insist on a change because I'm serious. What happens to the old fellows is that they get a technique going; they keep on using it.  

我坚持要改变，因为我是认真的。发生在老家伙身上的事情是，他们得到了一种技术；他们一直在使用它。  

They were marching in that direction which was right then, but the world changes. There's the new direction; but the old fellows are still marching in their former direction.  

他们朝着当时正确的方向行进，但世界变了。有了新的方向；但老伙计们还在朝着他们以前的方向前进。

You need to get into a new field to get new viewpoints, and _before_ you use up all the old ones. You can do something about this, but it takes effort and energy.  

你需要进入一个新的领域来获得新的观点，在你用完所有的旧观点之前。你可以为此做些什么，但这需要努力和精力。  

It takes courage to say, \`\`Yes, I will give up my great reputation.'' For example, when error correcting codes were well launched, having these theories, I said, \`\`Hamming, you are going to quit reading papers in the field; you are going to ignore it completely; you are going to try and do something else other than coast on that.'' I deliberately refused to go on in that field.  

说 "是的，我将放弃我的巨大声誉 "是需要勇气的。例如，当纠错码被很好地推出，拥有这些理论时，我说："汉明，你将放弃阅读该领域的论文；你将完全忽略它；你将尝试做其他事情，而不是在该领域的海岸。我故意拒绝在这个领域继续下去。  

I wouldn't even read papers to try to force myself to have a chance to do something else. I managed myself, which is what I'm preaching in this whole talk.  

我甚至不会读报纸，试图强迫自己有机会做别的事情。我自己管理自己，这就是我在这整个谈话中所宣扬的。  

Knowing many of my own faults, I manage myself. I have a lot of faults, so I've got a lot of problems, i.e. a lot of possibilities of management.  

知道我自己的许多缺点，我就自己管理自己。我有很多缺点，所以我有很多问题，也就是说，有很多管理的可能性。

_Question:_ Would you compare research and management?  

问题： 你会比较研究和管理吗？

_Hamming:_ If you want to be a great researcher, you won't make it being president of the company. If you want to be president of the company, that's another thing.  

汉明： 如果你想成为一个伟大的研究者，你不会成为公司的总裁。如果你想成为公司的总裁，那是另一回事。  

I'm not against being president of the company. I just don't want to be. I think Ian Ross does a good job as President of Bell Labs. I'm not against it; but you have to be clear on what you want.  

我不反对当公司的总裁。我只是不想当。我认为伊恩-罗斯作为贝尔实验室的总裁做得很好。我不反对；但你必须清楚你想要什么。  

Furthermore, when you're young, you may have picked wanting to be a great scientist, but as you live longer, you may change your mind.  

此外，当你年轻时，你可能会选择想成为一名伟大的科学家，但随着你的寿命延长，你可能会改变你的想法。  

For instance, I went to my boss, Bode, one day and said, \`\`Why did you ever become department head?  

例如，有一天我去找我的老板博德，说："你为什么曾经成为部门主管？  

Why didn't you just be a good scientist?'' He said, \`\`Hamming, I had a vision of what mathematics should be in Bell Laboratories. And I saw if that vision was going to be realized, _I_ had to make it happen; _I_ had to be department head.'' When your vision of what you want to do is what you can do single-handedly, then you should pursue it.  

你为什么不做一个好的科学家呢？他说："汉明，我对贝尔实验室的数学应该有一个愿景。我看到如果要实现这一愿景，我必须使之成为现实；我必须成为部门主管"。当你对你想做的事情的愿景是你可以单枪匹马做到的，那么你就应该追求它。  

The day your vision, what you think needs to be done, is bigger than what you can do single-handedly, then you have to move toward management.  

当你的愿景，你认为需要做的事情，比你单枪匹马所能做到的更大时，那么你就必须走向管理。  

And the bigger the vision is, the farther in management you have to go. If you have a vision of what the whole laboratory should be, or the whole Bell System, you have to get there to make it happen.  

愿景越大，你就必须在管理上走得越远。如果你对整个实验室或整个贝尔系统有一个愿景，你就必须到那里去实现它。

You can't make it happen from the bottom very easily. It depends upon what goals and what desires you have. And as they change in life, you have to be prepared to change.  

你不可能很容易地从底部实现它。这取决于你有什么目标，有什么愿望。而且随着他们在生活中的变化，你必须准备好改变。  

I chose to avoid management because I preferred to do what I could do single-handedly. But that's the choice that I made, and it is biased. Each person is entitled to their choice.  

我选择避免管理，因为我更愿意做我能单干的事情。但这是我做出的选择，而且是有偏见的。每个人都有权作出自己的选择。  

Keep an open mind. But when you do choose a path, for heaven's sake be aware of what you have done and the choice you have made. Don't try to do both sides.  

保持一个开放的心态。但当你真的选择了一条道路时，看在上帝的份上，要意识到你所做的事情和你所做的选择。不要试图两边都做。

_Question:_ How important is one's own expectation or how important is it to be in a group or surrounded by people who expect great work from you?  

问题： 一个人自己的期望有多重要，或者说，在一个团体中或周围的人对你的工作有多大的期望？

_Hamming:_ At Bell Labs everyone expected good work from me - it was a big help. Everybody expects you to do a good job, so you do, if you've got pride.  

汉明： 在贝尔实验室，每个人都期望我做得好--这是一个很大的帮助。每个人都希望你能做好工作，所以你就做了，如果你有自豪感的话。  

I think it's very valuable to have first-class people around. I sought out the best people. The moment that physics table lost the best people, I left.  

我认为身边有一流的人是非常有价值的。我寻找最好的人。当物理学桌失去最好的人的那一刻，我就离开了。  

The moment I saw that the same was true of the chemistry table, I left. I tried to go with people who had great ability so I could learn from them and who would expect great results out of me.  

当我看到化学表也是如此的时候，我就离开了。我试着和那些能力很强的人在一起，这样我就能从他们身上学到东西，而且他们会期待我取得好成绩。  

By deliberately managing myself, I think I did much better than laissez faire.  

通过刻意管理自己，我想我做得比放任自流要好得多。

_Question:_ You, at the outset of your talk, minimized or played down luck; but you seemed also to gloss over the circumstances that got you to Los Alamos, that got you to Chicago, that got you to Bell Laboratories.  

问题： 你在演讲一开始就尽量减少或淡化了运气；但你似乎也掩盖了让你到洛斯阿拉莫斯、让你到芝加哥、让你到贝尔实验室的情况。

_Hamming:_ There was some luck. On the other hand I don't know the alternate branches. Until you can say that the other branches would not have been equally or more successful, I can't say.  

汉明： 有一些运气。另一方面，我不知道备用的分支。除非你能说其他分支不会同样或更成功，否则我不能说。  

Is it luck the particular thing you do? For example, when I met Feynman at Los Alamos, I knew he was going to get a Nobel Prize. I didn't know what for.  

你所做的特定事情是运气吗？例如，当我在洛斯阿拉莫斯遇到费曼时，我知道他将会得到诺贝尔奖。我不知道是什么原因。  

But I knew darn well he was going to do great work. No matter what directions came up in the future, this man would do great work. And sure enough, he did do great work.  

但我清楚地知道，他将会做伟大的工作。无论将来出现什么方向，这个人都会做伟大的工作。果然，他确实做了伟大的工作。  

It isn't that you only do a little great work at this circumstance and that was luck, there are many opportunities sooner or later.  

并不是说你在这种情况下只做了一点伟大的工作，那是运气，早晚会有很多机会。  

There are a whole pail full of opportunities, of which, if you're in this situation, you seize one and you're great over there instead of over here. There is an element of luck, yes and no.  

有一整桶的机会，其中，如果你在这种情况下，你抓住了一个机会，你在那边而不是在这边就很好。有一个运气的因素，是的，也没有。  

Luck favors a prepared mind; luck favors a prepared person. It is not guaranteed; I don't guarantee success as being absolutely certain.  

运气偏爱有准备的头脑；运气偏爱有准备的人。它不被保证；我不保证成功是绝对肯定的。  

I'd say luck changes the odds, but there is some definite control on the part of the individual.  

我想说运气改变了几率，但个人方面有一些明确的控制。

Go forth, then, and do great work!  

那就去吧，去做伟大的工作！"！

**BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF RICHARD HAMMING  

理查德-汉明传记简述**

Richard W. Hamming was born February 11, 1915, in Chicago, Illinois. His formal education was marked by the following degrees (all in mathematics): B.S. 1937, University of Chicago; M.A.  

理查德-W-汉明于1915年2月11日出生在伊利诺伊州的芝加哥。他的正式教育以下列学位为标志（都是数学专业）：1937年在芝加哥大学获得理学士学位；1937年在芝加哥大学获得文学硕士学位。  

1939, University of Nebraska; and Ph.D. 1942, University of Illinois. His early experience was obtained at Los Alamos 1945-1946, i.e.  

1939年，内布拉斯加大学；1942年，伊利诺伊大学博士。他的早期经验是在洛斯阿拉莫斯1945-1946年获得的，也就是说。  

at the close of World War II, where he managed the computers used in building the first atomic bomb.  

二战结束后，他在那里管理用于制造第一颗原子弹的计算机。  

From there he went directly to Bell Laboratories where he spent thirty years in various aspects of computing, numerical analysis, and management of computing, i.e. 1946-1976. On July 23, 1976 he \`moved his office' to the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California where he taught, supervised research, and wrote books.  

从那里他直接去了贝尔实验室，在那里他在计算、数值分析和计算管理的各个方面度过了30年，即1946-1976年。1976年7月23日，他把办公室 "搬 "到了加州蒙特雷的海军研究生院，在那里他教书，监督研究，并写书。

While at Bell Laboratories, he took time to teach in Universities, sometimes locally and sometimes on a full sabbatical leave; these activities included visiting professorships at New York University, Princeton University (Statistics), City College of New York, Stanford University, 1960-61, Stevens Institute of Technology (Mathematics), and the University of California, Irvine, 1970-71.  

在贝尔实验室工作期间，他抽出时间在大学任教，有时是在当地，有时是在全休的情况下；这些活动包括在纽约大学、普林斯顿大学（统计学）、纽约城市学院、斯坦福大学（1960-61）、史蒂文斯理工学院（数学）和加利福尼亚大学欧文分校（1970-71）担任访问教授。

Richard Hamming has received a number of awards which include: Fellow, IEEE, 1968; the ACM Turing Prize, 1968; the IEEE Emanuel R.  

理查德-汉明获得了许多奖项，其中包括：1968年，IEEE会员；1968年，ACM图灵奖；IEEE伊曼纽尔R.  

Piore Award, 1979; Member, National Academy of Engineering, 1980; and the Harold Pender Award, U. Penn., 1981. In 1987 a major IEEE award was named after him, namely the Richard W.  

1979年，Piore奖；1980年，国家工程院院士；1981年，宾夕法尼亚大学Harold Pender奖。1987年，IEEE的一个重要奖项以他的名字命名，即Richard W.  

Hamming Medal, \`\`For exceptional contributions to information sciences and systems''; fittingly, he was also the first recipient of this award, 1988. In 1996 in Munich he received the prestigious $130,000 Eduard Rhein Award for Achievement in Technology for his work on error correcting codes.  

汉明奖，"由于对信息科学和系统的特殊贡献"；恰当的是，他也是这个奖项的第一个获得者，1988年。1996年在慕尼黑，他因其在纠错码方面的工作获得了著名的13万美元的爱德华-莱茵技术成就奖。  

He was both a Founder and Past President of ACM, and a Vice Pres. of the AAAS Mathematics Section.  

他是ACM的创始人和前任主席，以及AAAS数学分会的副主席。

He is probably best known for his pioneering work on error-correcting codes, his work on integrating differential equations, and the spectral window which bears his name.
