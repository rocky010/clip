## What mental models are 心智模型是什么

Mental models do two things: they help you **assess how things work** and they help you **make better decisions**. These two concepts underlie everything you do.  
心智模型做两件事：它们帮助你评估事情是如何运作的，它们帮助你做出更好的决定。这两个概念是您所做的一切的基础。  

For example, how does a rocket engine work (system)? And which type of rocket fuel should you use (decision)?  
例如，火箭发动机是如何工作（系统）的？您应该使用哪种类型的火箭燃料（决定）？  

The rocket engine is a **system** for you to reverse engineer and understand. It has many parts that depend on each other, and you want to map out how. As for which type of fuel to use, that's a **decision** you need to make.  
火箭发动机是一个供你逆向工程和理解的系统。它有许多相互依赖的部分，你想弄清楚如何。至于使用哪种燃料，那是你需要做出的决定。

Mental models guide you toward the best answer to both questions.  
心智模型会引导您找到这两个问题的最佳答案。

Without mental models, you typically stumble around in two ways:  
如果没有心智模型，您通常会以两种方式跌跌撞撞：  

1.  You go wherever your existing momentum takes you. You don't ask questions.  
    你去任何你现有的动力带你去的地方。你不问问题。
2.  You use your instincts—shaped by past experiences and memorized advice. This is a better approach than blindly following your momentum, but it's not that much better.  
    你使用你的直觉——由过去的经验和记住的建议塑造。这比盲目追随你的动力更好，但也好不到哪儿去。  
    

## How to assess systems 如何评估系统

The world makes more sense when you see it as a patchwork of systems—each of which can be reverse engineered with mental models.  
当您将世界视为系统的拼凑物时，这个世界就更有意义了——每个系统都可以用心智模型进行逆向工程。

A "system" is simply anything with multiple parts that depend on each other. Every machine and process is a system at some level. For example:  
“系统”就是具有多个相互依赖的部分的任何东西。每个机器和过程在某种程度上都是一个系统。例如：  

-   A **business**, such as Microsoft or a startup.  
    企业，例如 Microsoft 或初创公司。
-   A **tool**, such as a rocket or a keyboard.  
    一种工具，例如火箭或键盘。
-   A **process**, such as economic growth or sustaining a romantic relationship.  
    一个过程，例如经济增长或维持浪漫关系。
-   A **state of being**, such as your health or happiness.  
    一种存在状态，例如您的健康或幸福。  
    

A mental model of a system is a reduction of how it works. The model identifies the core components that matter and how they interact. This clarity is necessary to drastically improve the system:  
系统的心智模型是对其工作方式的简化。该模型确定了重要的核心组件以及它们如何交互。这种清晰度对于大幅改进系统是必要的：  

-   When you improve the system of business, you make more money.  
    当您改进业务系统时，您会赚更多的钱。
-   When you improve the system of relationships, you gain deeper friendships.  
    当您改善关系系统时，您会获得更深的友谊。  
    

Here's a mental model that SpaceX uses to reduce complex systems:  
这是 SpaceX 用于简化复杂系统的心智模型：

> **First Principles** — What is the most efficient way to solve a problem if you started from scratch? If you look past humanity’s attempts to solve it, what is the best approach if you reasoned from its fundamental principles?  
> 第一原则——如果您从头开始，解决问题的最有效方法是什么？如果你回顾人类解决它的尝试，如果你从它的基本原则推理，最好的方法是什么？

The SpaceX team looked past decades of incremental rocket improvements to re-examine spaceflight from scratch. They asked, What do the underlying engineering (not historical) principles reveal to be the most cost-efficient and power-efficient way to build a rocket? They worked up from those physical realities to build the world’s most efficient rocket.  
SpaceX 团队回顾了过去几十年火箭的增量改进，从头开始重新审视太空飞行。他们问道，基础工程（非历史）原则揭示了什么是建造火箭最具成本效益和功率效率的方法？他们从这些物理现实出发，建造了世界上最高效的火箭。

They let a simple mental model—one that fits on a cue card—guide them through the deconstruction of a massive system so they could drastically improve it.  
他们让一个简单的心理模型——一个适合提示卡的模型——引导他们解构一个庞大的系统，这样他们就可以大幅改进它。

That is the leverage of models. Imagine if you looked at every part of the world this way.  
这就是模型的杠杆作用。想象一下，如果你以这种方式看待世界的每一个角落。

Some people do. 有些人这样做。

#### First Principles in practice 实践中的首要原则

How do you use First Principles for your down-to-Earth problems?  
您如何使用第一原则来解决实际问题？  

For every project, ask: 对于每个项目，询问：  

1.  What system underlies this project? Is it a relationship, a business, a product, or something else with multiple components relying on each other?  
    这个项目的基础是什么系统？它是一种关系、一项业务、一种产品，还是其他具有多个相互依赖的组件的东西？
2.  Is this system already efficient?  
    这个系统已经有效了吗？
3.  If not, what are the ironclad principles underlying it?    
    如果不是，它背后的铁定原则是什么？
4.  Can I start over from those principles to identify a remarkably better way to design this system?  
    我能否从这些原则重新开始，以确定设计该系统的明显更好的方法？  
    

Anything that takes up a lot of your time must be investigated like this.  
任何占用你大量时间的事情都必须这样调查。

This brings us to our next question: How do we know which systems in our lives are worth significantly improving? To answer this, we'll use yet another mental model: one that I call One Level Higher.  
这就引出了我们的下一个问题：我们如何知道我们生活中的哪些系统值得显着改进？为了回答这个问题，我们将使用另一种心智模型：我称之为更高一级的心智模型。  

### One Level Higher 高一级  

> **One Level Higher** — Repeatedly ask whether you’re optimizing a cog in a machine instead of the machine itself. The higher the level you optimize at, typically the greater your ROI.  
> 更高一级——反复询问你是否在优化机器中的齿轮而不是机器本身。您优化的级别越高，通常您的投资回报率就越高。  

If you work for years to earn a 15% raise when you could switch jobs for an instant 25% salary boost, you're optimizing a cog (salary) in the machine (your job). You'd reach your goal quicker if you optimized the machine instead: find another job altogether. That's the higher level optimization.  
如果你为了加薪 15% 而工作多年，而你可以换工作以获得 25% 的即时加薪，那么你就是在优化机器（你的工作）中的一个齿轮（薪水）。如果你优化机器，你会更快地达到你的目标：完全找到另一份工作。那是更高层次的优化。

But you can go a level even higher.  
但你可以更上一层楼。

The job market is itself a cog in another machine: earning financial stability. But what if you could achieve financial stability without having to toil away at a 9 to 5? If your real passion lies outside of the office, then climbing the corporate ladder would be falling prey to inertia. Instead, the better path would be reducing your expenses by moving to a cheaper city and living more modestly. With lower costs, you could switch to part-time and pursue your passions.  
就业市场本身就是另一台机器上的一个齿轮：获得金融稳定性。但是，如果您无需朝九晚五地辛勤工作就可以实现财务稳定呢？如果你真正的激情在于办公室之外，那么攀登公司阶梯将成为惰性的牺牲品。相反，更好的方法是通过搬到更便宜的城市和更适度的生活来减少开支。以较低的成本，您可以转为兼职并追求您的激情。  

Isn’t that the higher-level game you're really optimizing for?  
这不是您真正要优化的更高级别的游戏吗？

#### We have a problem 我们出现了问题

The One Level Higher model is the process of asking yourself: Is it higher-leverage to optimize a level above the one I'm focused on?  
更高一级模型是问自己的过程：优化比我关注的级别更高的级别是否具有更高的杠杆作用？

This is a hard question to ask due to the phenomenon of inertia. Using a mental model to break out of your flow and question what you’re doing is like ripping the carpet out from under your goals. It’s painful to confront the possibility that you’ve spent years on the wrong thing. Whether it’s coding, a 9-5, saving money, building muscle—anything—you’ve been riding the momentum of steady progress.  
由于惯性现象，这是一个很难问的问题。使用心智模型来打破你的流程并质疑你在做什么就像从你的目标下面撕掉地毯一样。面对你花了数年时间做错事情的可能性是痛苦的。无论是编码、朝九晚五、省钱、锻炼肌肉——任何事情——你都在稳步前进。

What people don't realize is that working hard without asking what are the better things to be working on is a hidden form of laziness. Yes, appreciate the beauty of flow when you're in it, but don't become addicted to it.  
人们没有意识到的是，不问什么是更好的工作而努力工作是一种隐藏的懒惰形式。是的，当你身处其中时，欣赏流动之美，但不要沉迷其中。

Losing agency over your life due to extended flow is what I call flow paralysis. **It is the archenemy of critical thinking.** It's the clearest sign you’ve abandoned mental models, because the use of models continually adjusts your life trajectory. This is what I meant earlier when I said: "Accomplished people regularly reassess their priorities without fear of changing them. They don't fall prey to inertia."  
由于流量延长而失去对你生活的控制权，这就是我所说的流量瘫痪。它是批判性思维的大敌。这是你放弃心智模型的最明显标志，因为模型的使用不断调整你的生活轨迹。这就是我之前所说的意思：“有成就的人会定期重新评估他们的优先事项，而不用担心改变它们。他们不会成为惰性的牺牲品。”

Think of it like this: mental models are powered by information. They produce different recommendations based on the updated information you put into them. So, if you're in a flow state for a long time, you'll have buried your head without ingesting new data, advice, articles, and so on. Your mental model will no longer be a functioning compass for what to do next.  
可以这样想：心智模型由信息驱动。他们根据您输入的更新信息生成不同的建议。所以，如果你长时间处于心流状态，你就会埋头不吸收新的数据、建议、文章等。你的心智模型将不再是下一步该做什么的指南针。

A classic example is how teenagers are told to go to college. They enter a flow state in pursuit of college but at no point do they question themselves out of it: Should you really be going to school for the degree you chose? Or did you choose the degree because “it felt right" when you were 17 and you haven’t re-examined the decision since? Could you make a convincing argument for why all the other degrees would not be better options? If you can’t make that argument convincingly, you’re not thinking critically. Once they get to college, they're in a flow state of trying to graduate. They play a low-level game of securing a high GPA instead of a higher-level game of learning useful skills that prepare them for the job market.  
一个典型的例子是青少年被告知要上大学。他们在追求大学的过程中进入心流状态，但他们从来没有质疑过自己：你真的应该为了你选择的学位而上学吗？还是你选择这个学位是因为你 17 岁时“感觉不错”，从那以后你就没有重新审视过这个决定？你能给出一个令人信服的论据来说明为什么所有其他学位都不是更好的选择吗？如果你能不要令人信服地提出这个论点，你没有批判性地思考。一旦他们上了大学，他们就处于试图毕业的流动状态。他们玩的是确保高 GPA 的低级游戏，而不是更高级别的游戏学习有用的技能，为就业市场做好准备。

That's **four years** of a life treated like a homework assignment instead of a deliberate decision of what's best for oneself.  
四年的生活就像家庭作业一样对待，而不是深思熟虑地决定什么对自己最好。

This applies to everything we do. How about your job? Did you pursue it simply because it met your conditions and it was available when you needed it? And now you've been working there for years, yet you learned everything it could teach you in the first year? And how about your friendships? Are you socializing with people who aren't great to be around? Why? There are seven billion other people to spend time with.  
这适用于我们所做的一切。你的工作怎么样？你追求它是不是因为它符合你的条件，你需要的时候有？现在你已经在那里工作多年了，但你在第一年就学会了它能教给你的一切？你的友谊呢？您是否正在与不适合周围的人交往？为什么？还有 70 亿其他人可以与之共度时光。

These are the systems and decisions you must periodically reassess.  
这些是您必须定期重新评估的系统和决策。

This brings us to our next mental model category: how to make decisions.  
这将我们带到下一个心智模型类别：如何做出决定。

> "When you view the world as a series of outputs, you form opinions. But when you view the world as a series of systems, you form strategies." —Channing Allen  
> “当你将世界视为一系列输出时，你就会形成意见。但当你将世界视为一系列系统时，你就会形成战略。” ——查宁·艾伦  

## How to make decisions 如何做决定

I’ve only discussed half the power of mental models: optimizing systems to get more out of them. The other half is making better decisions.  
我只讨论了心智模型的一半力量：优化系统以从中获得更多收益。另一半是做出更好的决定。  

Good decision-making is the discipline of silencing your instincts and switching over to mental models.  
良好的决策制定是让你的直觉沉默并转向心智模型的纪律。

Leave the "gut decisions" for playing sports, and avoid them when playing life.  
为运动留下“直觉决定”，在生活中避免它们。  

Everyday decisions fall into two categories:  
日常决策分为两类：  

-   **Prioritizing** — Which path is the best to take?  
    确定优先级——哪条路最好走？
-   **Allocating** — How much attention, time, or capital should be spent on this?  
    分配——应该在这上面花费多少注意力、时间或资金？  
    

Here’s an example of a mental model to prioritize which projects to work on:  
这是一个心智模型的例子，用于确定要处理的项目的优先级：

> **Regret Minimization** — To maximize your long-term happiness, prioritize projects you’d most regret not having pursued by the time you’re old and looking back at your life.  
> 后悔最小化——为了最大化你的长期幸福，优先考虑你最后悔没有在你年老并回顾你的生活时没有追求的项目。

This mental model leverages the lifehack that encompasses all others: be good to your future self. Our brains aren't wired to prioritize our future selves, so we need mental models to keep us disciplined.  
这种心智模式利用了包含所有其他人的生活窍门：善待未来的自己。我们的大脑不会优先考虑我们未来的自己，所以我们需要心智模型来让我们保持纪律。

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwG_qR6XmDQ" data-immersive-translate-effect="1"></iframe>

Bezos used Regret Minimization to break out of his Amazon **flow** and **prioritize** his own space exploration company. Like SpaceX, he then used **First Principles** to re-examine space flight from the ground up. His space company, Blue Origin, competes with SpaceX for NASA contracts.  
贝索斯使用 Regret Minimization 打破了他的亚马逊流程，并优先考虑他自己的太空探索公司。与 SpaceX 一样，他随后使用第一性原理从头开始重新审视太空飞行。他的太空公司 Blue Origin 与 SpaceX 竞争 NASA 合同。

#### Pareto principle

Now here’s another decision-making mental model. This one helps you **allocate** resources:  
现在这是另一种决策心智模型。这个可以帮助您分配资源：

> **Pareto Principle** — 80% of your output will come from the top 20% of your inputs. To maximize ROI, preferentially invest in the 20%.  
> 帕累托原则——80% 的产出将来自前 20% 的投入。为了最大化投资回报率，优先投资于 20%。

For example, 80% of the value you get from socializing comes from the top 20% of your friends. So, preferentially strengthen relationships with those friends and drop many of the rest. Be cognizant of nourishing the friendships that actually matter.  
例如，你从社交中获得的价值的 80% 来自于你最重要的 20% 的朋友。所以，优先加强与那些朋友的关系，而放弃其他许多。认识到滋养真正重要的友谊。  

Another example: 80% of your procrastination comes from 20% of your indulgences. So, place those 2-4 top indulgences out of arm’s reach, and you’ll see an outsized gain in weekly output. The implication is that you don’t have to completely isolate yourself from distractions. That would be inefficient and impractical. Just do the 80/20.  
再举个例子：你80%的拖延来自于20%的放纵。因此，将这 2-4 种顶级放纵放在伸手可及的地方，您将看到每周产量的巨大增长。这意味着您不必完全将自己与干扰隔离开来。那将是低效和不切实际的。只需执行 80/20。  

## Putting mental models to use 运用心智模型

Enough theory. Let's apply these models to your life.  
足够的理论。让我们将这些模型应用到您的生活中。

The mental models below are recommended because they’re **frequently needed**, **easy to apply**, and **reliably accurate** at achieving better outcomes.  
推荐使用以下心智模型，因为它们经常被需要，易于应用，并且可靠准确地实现更好的结果。

After these examples is the most important part of this essay.  
在这些例子之后是本文最重要的部分。

### Optimizing systems 优化系统

As a reminder, here are examples of systems:  
提醒一下，以下是系统示例：  

-   A **process**, such as economic growth or maintaining a romantic relationship.  
    一个过程，例如经济增长或维持浪漫关系。
-   A **business**, such as Microsoft or a sports team.  
    企业，例如 Microsoft 或运动队。
-   A **machine**, such as a toothbrush or a rocket.  
    一种机器，例如牙刷或火箭。
-   A **state of being**, such as your health or happiness.  
    一种存在状态，例如您的健康或幸福。  
    

And here’s what to do when encountering important systems in your life.  
以下是遇到生活中的重要系统时应该做的事情。  

#### One Level Higher 1 高一级

First, when dealing with a system, **start** by identifying the highest-leverage level to optimize at: Ask whether you’re optimizing the machine or a cog within it.  
首先，在处理系统时，首先要确定要优化的最高杠杆级别：问问你是在优化机器还是其中的一个齿轮。  

#### Theory of Constraints 2 约束理论

Once Local/Global has shown you the best system, begin optimizing that system by following the [Theory of Constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints): At any time, know that it's just one of a system’s inputs that is constraining the other inputs from achieving a greater total output. Therefore, to continuously increase a system’s output, iteratively identify and address the current constraint.  
一旦 Local/Global 向您展示了最佳系统，就可以通过遵循约束理论开始优化该系统：在任何时候，都知道它只是系统的输入之一，它限制了其他输入以实现更大的总输出。因此，要不断增加系统的输出，迭代地识别和解决当前的约束。  

For example, if you’re trying to pursue a hobby but you can’t get yourself to start, first identify the underlying inputs:  
例如，如果您正在尝试追求一种爱好，但又无从下手，请首先确定潜在的投入：  

-   Time
-   Motivation
-   Knowledge of how to move forward  
    知道如何前进  
    

Ask yourself: By doubling which of these inputs could I finally get myself to pursue the hobby? Increase that input first. Then, if you find yourself stuck again after starting, ask the question once again. Perhaps next time it'll be your time or motivation that's the new constraint.  
问问自己：通过加倍这些投入中的哪一个，我最终可以让自己追求这个爱好？首先增加那个输入。然后，如果你发现自己在开始后又卡住了，就再问一遍这个问题。也许下一次，新的限制将是你的时间或动力。

The Theory of Constraints is especially important in business. Maybe you're not getting more customers because one of your inputs is constraining the others:  
约束理论在商业中尤为重要。也许您没有获得更多客户，因为您的输入之一限制了其他输入：  

-   Lead flow
-   Sales skill
-   Product quality
-   Pricing

Find your bottleneck, increase its capacity, and continuously repeat this process until you get where you want. At any given time, one thing will be holding you back the most. Your job is to remember to pause and look for it.  
找到你的瓶颈，增加它的容量，并不断重复这个过程，直到你到达你想要的地方。在任何给定时间，一件事最能阻碍你。你的工作是记得停下来寻找它。

Eventually, you'll hit the maximum potential for your current implementation. That's when you switch to First Principles or revisit One Level Higher to break out of your bubble and move onto better things.  
最终，您将发挥当前实施的最大潜力。那是当你切换到第一原则或重新审视更高一级以打破你的泡沫并转向更好的事情时。  

#### First Principles 3 首要原则

If making iterative improvements using the Theory of Constraints doesn’t get a system to your desired level of efficiency, discard the system's current approach and re-examine the system from the ground up. Take nothing but the proven, underlying principles as given. Work up from there to create something better.  
如果使用约束理论进行迭代改进不能使系统达到您期望的效率水平，请放弃系统当前的方法并从头开始重新检查系统。除了给定的经过验证的基本原则外，别无所求。从那里努力创造更好的东西。

#### Recap

Using the above three models, we can navigate systems with efficiency:  

-   Use One Level Higher to identify the right level to be optimizing.
-   Use the Theory of Constraints to optimize the system.
-   When that gets you as far as you can go, use First Principles to break out of your rut and design a better system from the ground up.

### Making decisions

We can follow a similar chain of mental models for decision-making.  

#### Long-term: Regret Minimization

Make **long-term** life decisions using Regret Minimization: choose whichever option you’ll most regret not having pursued when looking back at the end of your life. This is how you optimize for long-term fulfillment.  

#### Medium-term: Pareto’s Principle

Make **medium-term** decisions using Pareto's Principle: to maximize ROI, preferentially invest in the 20% of inputs that produce the most output.

This is how you optimize each year or decade of your life—who to spend time with, which skills to hone, and which businesses to build.  

#### Short-term: ICE

Make **short-term** decisions using the ICE model: When facing many options needing prioritization, score each on three variables using a scale of 1-10:    

1.  How much positive **I**mpact the option would have if it succeeded.
2.  The **C**onfidence you have that this option will succeed if you attempt it.
3.  How **E**asy (low resource, low time) it would be to pursue this option.  
    

Add the 1-10 scores together then divide by three to get your average. Repeat this exercise for each option you're considering then rank all the options by their ICE scores.

Options at the top of the list will have the highest expected value and should be given priority over the others.  

This is how you plan your life on the timescale of weeks or months. For example, it's how my business decides which marketing projects to pursue.  

#### Immediate: Eisenhower Matrix

Finally, The Eisenhower Matrix helps you make day-to-day decisions: Make a 2x2 grid with its axes labeled "Important" and "Urgent." Categorize your daily tasks into the four quadrants and prioritize them in this order: important and urgent, important but non-urgent, unimportant but urgent, and unimportant and non-urgent.

## What you're supposed to do now

Mental models are critical for living wisely. Yet, somehow they're not even a blip on our educational radar.  

Here's what I recommend: Schedule a recurring event in your calendar. Every second Friday, block out 20 minutes to step back from your life and run all your systems and decisions through the mental models listed above.  

Apply these models to your life as if you’re improving somebody else’s life. [Research shows](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614535400?journalCode=pssa) that when you act like you’re giving a friend advice, **you sidestep your flow paralysis**. Meaning, talk to yourself in the third person: “Julian, you are doing X. Why aren’t you doing Y instead? What would a mental model suggest is the best path forward?”  

That’s all it takes to get started: every week, run your life through mental models as if you’re assessing somebody else’s life.  

This post is a 2,500 word PSA advising you to be more thoughtful about your life because you only have one and your future self **is you**.
