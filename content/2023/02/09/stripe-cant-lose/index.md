For the last decade, Stripe could do no wrong. When the payments technology company—used by companies such as Amazon, Instacart, and Shopify—launched in 2010, it revolutionized the industry, making it much easier for small companies to accept payments.  

在过去的十年里，条纹不会做错任何事。亚马逊（Amazon）、Instacart和Shopify等公司使用的支付技术公司在2010年推出时，彻底改变了行业，让小公司更容易接受支付。  

Entrepreneurs and software developers adored Stripe. Venture capitalists loved the company even more, pouring billions of dollars into the business, which made it, for a time, the most valuable private company in the U.S. at $95 billion.   

企业家和软件开发人员都很喜欢Stripe。风险投资家们甚至更喜欢这家公司，向它投入了数十亿美元，使它一度成为美国最有价值的私人公司，价值950亿美元。

Within the broader tech industry, buyers have thirsted after Stripe shares on the secondary market, and working at Stripe began to signal the same level of intelligence and future potential that working at Google and eBay had in previous eras. Today, in the midst of a [tech recession](https://stratechery.com/2023/the-four-horsemen-of-the-tech-recession/), many are hoping that Stripe can save the rest of the industry by being the first to go public, thereby opening up the opportunity for other companies to do the same.  

在更广泛的科技行业内，买家对Stripe在二级市场上的股票如饥似渴，在Stripe工作开始显示出与前几个时代在谷歌和eBay工作时相同的智力水平和未来潜力。如今，在科技行业陷入衰退的情况下，许多人都希望Stripe能够率先上市，从而为其他公司提供同样的机会，从而保存整个行业。

But the picture is decidedly less rosy for Stripe than it was, say, two years ago. The company has had its wins—announcing [partnerships](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/18/stripe-expands-its-infrastructure-play-with-data-pipeline-to-sync-financial-data-with-amazon-and-snowflake/) with [Amazon](https://www.batchprocessing.co/p/batch-4-stripe-amazon-and-the-compounding), launching [new products](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/24/stripe-launches-app-marketplace-scripts-and-tools-incorporating-third-party-saas-apps-that-work-alongside-stripe/), being named a [Forrester Wave Leader](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/stripe-wave-2022)—but for perhaps the first time in the company’s history, Stripe finds itself in a seemingly unfamiliar scenario: not everything is going its way.   

但对于Stripe来说，情况显然不如两年前那么乐观。Stripe取得了一些成功--宣布与Amazon合作、发布新产品、被评为Forrester Wave领导者--但这可能是公司历史上第一次，Stripe发现自己陷入了一个看似陌生的境地：不是所有事情都按计划进行。

There was the unfortunate public kerfuffle with fellow fintech darling Plaid in May 2022, in which Stripe defended itself against allegations of unscrupulous conduct after it released Financial Connections, a product directly competitive to Plaid’s core offering—after Stripe had offered Plaid to its clients instead of its own product.  

2022年5月，Stripe与同为金融科技宠儿的Plaid发生了一场不幸的公开混战，Stripe在发布了Financial Connections（一款与Plaid核心产品直接竞争的产品）后为自己的不道德行为指控进行了辩护--此前Stripe向客户提供的是Plaid，而不是自己的产品。

Then came reports that mutual funds like Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price were marking down their holdings in Stripe by as much as 64%. Stripe has marked down its internal valuation three times since June 2022.   

随后有报道称，富达投资（FidelityInvestments）和T.罗·普莱斯将他们在条纹公司的持股削减了64%。2022年6月以来，条纹股份已三次下调内部估值。

In November 2022, amid a broader tech slowdown, the company laid off 14% of its staff, stating that the company "[grew operating costs too quickly](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/ceo-patrick-collisons-email-to-stripe-employees)." Recent reporting from [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/exclusive-stripe-plans-to-go-public-in-next-year-or-make-a-deal-to-resolve-employee-stock-squeeze?rc=kwzn2x) has revealed that Stripe plans to provide liquidity to employees—some of whom have restricted stock units, or RSUs, that are set to expire 10 years after they were initially issued—by going public through a direct listing or by continuing to raise funds from private investors. [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stripes-revenue-growth-slid-last-year-as-firm-burned-through-cash?rc=kwzn2x)’s reporting also uncovered concerns about the company’s financials: slowing revenue growth and a lack of profitability.   

2022年11月，在更广泛的科技放缓中，该公司裁员14%，称该公司“运营成本增长过快。“The Information最近的报道显示，Stripe计划通过直接上市或继续从私人投资者那里筹集资金，为员工提供流动性，其中一些人拥有限制性股票单位，这些单位将在最初发行后10年到期。 该信息的报告还揭示了对该公司财务状况的担忧：收入增长放缓和盈利能力不足。

Stripe isn’t doomed—but its success is not inevitable. Nor will it be the only winner in the payments industry.   

Stripe并不是注定要失败的，但它的成功也不是必然的。它也不会是支付行业唯一的赢家。

Stripe is an innovative company that is facing competition as it moves upmarket and fends off new entrants as the market expands.  

Stripe是一家创新型公司，在进军高端市场的同时面临着竞争，并在市场扩张时击退了新进入者。  

As Stripe approaches an eventual public offering, it must become more disciplined in its spending, learning to balance investments in long-term growth with near-term profitability. Let’s take a look at where Stripe started from and what it’s up against in 2023 and beyond.  

随着Stripe接近最终的公开发行，它必须在支出方面变得更加自律，学会平衡长期增长投资与短期盈利能力。我们一起来看看Stripe从哪里起步，以及在2023年及以后的日子里，它面临着怎样的挑战。

## Early innovation  

早期创新

Stripe is famous for catering to developers, an overlooked but increasingly important buyer persona in internet-economy companies, but the company’s real innovation in the early days was making payments more accessible and invisible than other offerings at the time.  

Stripe以迎合开发者而闻名，开发者是互联网经济公司中被忽视但越来越重要的买家角色，但该公司早期真正的创新是让支付比当时的其他产品更容易获得和隐形。  

When Stripe launched in 2010 there were two advantages that made it stand out relative to the competition: it offered a white-label solution and (nearly) instant access to payments acceptance at the exact right time.   

Stripe在2010年推出时，有两个优势使其在竞争中脱颖而出：它提供了一个白标签解决方案，并在确切的正确时间（几乎）即时获得付款承兑。

The most popular payments product of the 2000s was PayPal. A website using PayPal to accept payments required users—both the buyer and the seller—to have PayPal accounts and complete a transaction on PayPal’s site instead of its own.  

2000年代最流行的支付产品是PayPal。使用PayPal接受付款的网站要求用户（买方和卖方）拥有PayPal帐户，并在PayPal网站上完成交易 它自己的。  

Many startups in the 2010s were trying to emulate the online experience of marketplaces like Airbnb, where the entire transaction took place on site.  

21世纪10年代，许多初创企业都试图模仿Airbnb等市场的在线体验，在那里，整个交易都在现场进行。  

Using front-end frameworks like Node and later React made it easier for Stripe to offer a white-label checkout experience without bouncing customers to a third-party site like PayPal.   

使用像Node和后来的React这样的前端框架，Stripe可以更容易地提供一个白标签结账体验，而不必将客户跳转到像PayPal这样的第三方网站。

Around the same time, mobile payment experiences were being refined.  

与此同时，移动的支付体验也在不断完善。  

The ability to complete transactions within an app without going to the PayPal app—think card-on-file experiences like Uber or in-app purchasing like Instacart—was necessary for startups of the era, when the iPhone and App Store began to flourish.  

在一个应用程序中完成交易而不需要使用贝宝应用程序--想想优步（Uber）这样的卡片存档体验或Instagram这样的应用程序内购买--这对那个时代的初创公司来说是必要的，当时iPhone和应用程序商店（App Store）开始蓬勃发展。  

In-app purchases for digital goods were fairly straightforward at the time: you would use iOS’s built-in payments capabilities, but for purchases of items or services in the real world, there was a big gap in payments capabilities.  

在当时，应用内购买数字商品相当简单：你可以使用iOS的内置支付功能，但在真实的世界中购买商品或服务时，支付功能存在很大差距。  

There were companies—a combination of legacy payment processors, one of thousands of Independent Sales Organizations (ISOs, which offer standalone credit card processing services), and/or a few dozen payment gateways (which don’t offer wallet or stored balance functionality)—that merchants could use to set up white-label transactions, but they were difficult to work with.   

商家可以使用一些公司来建立白标交易，这些公司包括传统的支付处理商、数千家独立销售组织（ISO，提供独立的信用卡处理服务）中的一家，以及/或者几十家支付网关（不提供钱包或存储余额功能），但很难与之合作。

The conventional path to obtaining a merchant account (i.e.  

获得商家账户的常规路径（即，  

, as a retailer or an accountant) in 2010 involved emailing or faxing in paperwork to an ISO, waiting days or weeks for that information to be reviewed by a processor, and going through a cumbersome process to register that merchant account with a separate payment gateway.  

作为零售商或会计师）在2010年需要通过电子邮件或传真向ISO发送文书工作，等待数天或数周以供处理器审查该信息，并通过繁琐的流程向单独的支付网关注册该商家帐户。  

Stripe did all of that in minutes—an immeasurably better experience than the competition, even if, in the early days, its founders were doing everything [manually behind the scenes](https://www.startupgrind.com/blog/from-the-vault-patrick-collison-stripe-full-startup-grind-interview-2012/).  

Stripe在几分钟内就完成了所有这些，这是一个比竞争对手更好的体验，尽管在早期，它的创始人在幕后手动完成所有事情。

## Increasing competition  

竞争加剧

Today, Stripe is competing against other modern payments companies, well-funded upstarts, and formidable incumbents that offer much of the same functionality as Stripe. The payments landscape in the U.S. can be split into two categories:   

今天，Stripe正在与其他现代支付公司、资金充足的后起之秀以及提供与Stripe大部分相同功能的强大现有公司竞争。美国的支付格局可分为两类：

**Legacy payment processors   

传统支付处理器**

-   Chase Merchant Services  
    
    大通商户服务
-   First Data by Fiserv  
    
    第一个数据由Fiserv提供
-   Worldpay from FIS  
    
    FIS的Worldpay
-   Global Payments  
    
    全球支付

**Modern payment processors  

现代支付处理器**

-   Adyen
-   Stripe
-   Braintree  
    
    布雷恩特里
-   Checkout.com  
    
    Checkout.com

For the last decade, modern payment providers like Adyen and Stripe have, for the most part, been eating the legacy providers’ lunch—especially when it comes to winning the business of up-and-coming companies.  

在过去的十年里，像Adyen和Stripe这样的现代支付提供商在很大程度上一直在吃传统提供商的午餐，特别是在赢得新兴公司的业务方面。  

For reasons similar to what I explained above, the modern providers’ products were better suited for digitally native applications and were easier to use than the incumbents’.  

出于类似于我上面解释的原因，现代供应商的产品更适合于数字原生应用程序，比现有供应商的产品更容易使用。  

During the pandemic, not only did the modern processors, which have a higher concentration of e-commerce payments volume, do well; their more flexible technology was a key asset to brick-and-mortar merchants that suddenly found themselves accepting payments across multiple channels: in-person, in-app, and online.  

大流行期间，不仅电商支付量集中度较高的现代处理商表现出色;他们更灵活的技术是实体商家的关键资产，这些商家突然发现自己可以接受多个渠道的支付：面对面、应用程序内和在线。

[![](optimized_Screen20Shot202023-02-0720at202.46.1020PM.png)](https://fintechindex.fprimecapital.com/State%20of%20Fintech%20(2021%20Report).pdf)

The legacy processors responded mostly by buying other payments companies to boost their total payments volume (TPV), culminating in a handful of [mega-mergers in 2019](https://www.batchprocessing.co/p/2019-payments-year-in-review-part-1). Today, despite the pandemic-fueled growth of modern players, legacy players still control the bulk of the market and are growing trillions of dollars worth of TPV [~9% year over year](https://investors.fiserv.com/static-files/2dad2340-9a66-4f35-a017-74096dfffe90). But modern players are growing hundreds of billions of dollars of TPV ~60% year over year, so it’s not hard to imagine the relative market share between the two categories flipping over the next decade.  

传统处理商的应对方式大多是收购其他支付公司，以提升其支付总量（TPV），最终在2019年出现了几起特大型并购。今天，尽管现代玩家在大流行的推动下增长，传统玩家仍然控制着大部分市场，并且每年增长价值数万亿美元的TPV ~9%。但现代玩家的TPV每年增长数千亿美元~60%，因此不难想象未来十年这两个类别之间的相对市场份额会发生翻转。

[![](optimized_755Ivx-J-lW5xCwd0FryL7Or8xbZR8CAtt-xBpAO5suIrzSQFwrswfbcumEiO0yLr9LqPuRmLzAKeWEpmNPJEx8fLxC4Nphk8vvJ0EAbol38EIo94pKxPDzRhhBg.png)](https://fintechindex.fprimecapital.com/State%20of%20Fintech%20(2021%20Report).pdf)

But Stripe hasn’t won yet. Neither has Adyen or Checkout, for that matter. The legacy providers process payments for massive customers that are unlikely to switch over to modern processors any time soon.  

但条纹还没赢。Adyen和Checkout也没有，就这一点而言。传统的提供商为大量的客户处理支付，这些客户不太可能很快转向现代处理器。  

Worldpay, for example, powers payments for some of the country’s leading grocery and pharmacy brands, including Kroger, which sold [$137.9 billion worth of goods](https://ir.kroger.com/CorporateProfile/press-releases/press-release/2022/Kroger-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2021-Results/default.aspx) (excluding fuel) in 2021. Over the two years, Stripe has been making it a point to [showcase](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/stripe-series-h) how many of its customers are processing over $1 billion annually.   

例如，Worldpay为美国一些领先的杂货店和药店品牌提供支付服务，包括克罗格（Kroger），该公司2021年销售了价值1379亿美元的商品（不包括燃料）。在过去的两年里，Stripe一直致力于展示每年有多少客户处理超过10亿美元的业务。

As the pandemic has begun to ease, consumer spending is shifting again. Visa and Mastercard’s latest earnings show a surge in in-person (what they call card-present) spending for 2022 relative to 2021, specifically within the travel category.   

随着疫情开始缓解，消费者支出再次发生转变。Visa和万事达卡的最新财报显示，2022年的当面（他们称之为卡现）消费相对于2021年大幅增长，特别是在旅行类消费领域。

[![](optimized_2j2iyA_xAzpg_3rToann4pk8PYDlV-fNg-NLrdq2pHAEPVmkR0ehLsgNWn3_8eLZgv-O93LE50bIJbFQgvMrhtV5rc4UWZo--9FPLcw89u77XtxC7G8R-HZrtG_-.png)](https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/2488/optimized_2j2iyA_xAzpg_3rToann4pk8PYDlV-fNg-NLrdq2pHAEPVmkR0ehLsgNWn3_8eLZgv-O93LE50bIJbFQgvMrhtV5rc4UWZo--9FPLcw89u77XtxC7G8R-HZrtG_-.png)

That lagging green line—"Card Not Present, Excluding Travel"—is from where the bulk of Stripe’s payments volume and therefore revenue comes. U.S. Census Bureau data shows the pullback in e-commerce spending even more clearly: it’s basically back to the pre-pandemic trend line.   

这条滞后的绿色线--“不含旅行卡”--是Stripe大部分支付量和收入的来源。美国人口普查局数据显示，电商支出的回撤更加明显：基本上回到了大流行前的趋势线。

[![](optimized_y1DX3iHM8dHg1SrO2us2gqpA7AlofE55y620bpe8M3cJ5SM7vkeiLQnnLK3_LRttlpbAX_bcmXP0QK_fAhjJ2EnAd2XhtfTvVfr-FA9lLku3rXhYVLsJEJmjoTnw.png)](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2022/7/28/ways-to-think-about-e-commerce-penetration)

A portion of the e-commerce slowdown is due to the impact of Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) policy, a collection of technology and rule changes that Apple began introducing over the past two years. ATT requires apps using Apple’s mobile operating system to [allow users to opt into being "tracked.](https://mobiledevmemo.com/the-att-recession/)" Apps are then allowed to share user data with third parties that a user may not have dealt with directly.  

电商增速放缓的部分原因是受到苹果应用程序跟踪透明度（ATT）政策的影响，这是苹果在过去两年开始推出的一系列技术和规则变化。ATT要求使用苹果移动的操作系统的应用程序允许用户选择被“跟踪”。“然后，应用程序被允许与用户可能没有直接接触过的第三方共享用户数据。  

This third-party tracking is the basis for digital advertising platforms, specifically direct-response advertising for e-commerce products and mobile apps on platforms like Meta, Snap, and YouTube.   

这种第三方跟踪是数字广告平台的基础，特别是针对梅塔、Snap和YouTube等平台上的电子商务产品和移动的应用程序的直接响应广告。

Due to ATT, direct-to-consumer companies like Warby Parker and the e-commerce platforms that support them (i.e., Shopify) are struggling. In turn, Stripe’s revenue growth has dropped considerably, down to 20% in 2022 from 60% the year prior.  

由于ATT，Warby帕克等直接面向消费者的公司和支持它们的电子商务平台（即Shopify）都在苦苦挣扎。反过来，Stripe的营收增速也大幅下滑，从上年的60%下滑至2022年的20%。  

By comparison, Amsterdam-based digital payments company Adyen grew its net revenue by 37% year over year in the first half of 2022—a slowdown from the 70% growth rate it posted in 2021 but not as severe as Stripe’s.  

相比之下，总部位于阿姆斯特丹的数字支付公司Adyen在2022年上半年的净收入同比增长37%--较其2021年公布的70%增速有所放缓，但没有Stripe那么严重。  

Worldpay’s revenue growth rate also contracted as of Q3 2022, but only from 14% to 9%, and the company is expected to fare well in 2023 as in-person payments continue to grow.   

截至2022年第三季度，Worldpay的收入增速也有所收缩，但仅从14%降至9%，随着当面支付业务持续增长，预计该公司2023年将表现良好。

Among the modern providers, Stripe’s fiercest competition is from Netherlands-based Adyen, arguably the [best-run payments company](https://www.batchprocessing.co/p/payments-profitability) in the world. Historically, these two have largely avoided each other. Stripe spent the first part of its life focused on winning smaller businesses while Adyen served enterprise customers from day one. Adyen is a European powerhouse; Stripe has mainly operated in the U.S.  

在现代支付服务提供商中，Stripe最激烈的竞争来自荷兰的Adyen，它可以说是世界上运营最好的支付公司。从历史上看，这两个人在很大程度上是互相回避的。Stripe的前半段时间专注于赢得小型企业，而Adyen从第一天起就为企业客户服务。Adyen是一个欧洲强国;Stripe主要在美国运营。  

More recently, the two companies have been going head to head. Stripe is now co-headquartered in San Francisco and Dublin, Ireland, and has more than doubled its geographic footprint in the past five years, mostly in Europe.  

最近，这两家公司一直在正面交锋。Stripe目前在弗朗西斯科和爱尔兰都柏林设有联合总部，过去五年其地理足迹增加了一倍多，主要是在欧洲。  

Adyen is growing its North American volume 60% year over year and has a banking license under a San Francisco-based charter.  

Adyen在北美的业务量同比增长60%，并根据旧金山的章程获得了银行牌照。  

Adyen’s stated goal is to access more small businesses through its Adyen for Platforms offering, while Stripe is focused on closing larger enterprise deals that will meaningfully add to its revenue.   

Adyen的既定目标是通过其Adyen平台产品接触更多的小企业，而Stripe则专注于完成更大的企业交易，这将有意义地增加其收入。

The enterprise segment is where Adyen shines and is beginning to challenge the legacy players. Over the past few years, Adyen has moved from winning deals to process non-U.S.  

企业细分市场是Adyen的亮点，并开始挑战传统的参与者。在过去几年中，Adyen已从赢得交易转向处理非美国  

payments for digitally native companies like Uber and Netflix to winning deals to handle payments around the world for traditional large businesses like McDonald’s and Subway As a result, its in-person payments volume grew a whopping 97%, according to its [most recent investor filings](https://investors.adyen.com/financials/h1-2022). To fight back, Stripe acquired BBPOS, "[a leading card reader provider](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/stripe-terminal-accelerates-global-momentum)," for an undisclosed sum in January 2022.  

Uber和Netflix等数字原生公司的支付业务，以赢得为麦当劳和赛百味等传统大型企业处理全球支付业务的交易。根据其最新的投资者备案文件，其个人支付业务量增长了97%。为了反击，2022年1月，Stripe以未公开的金额收购了“领先的读卡器提供商”BBPOS。

[![](optimized_ze20of20Company.png)](https://monetarymusings.substack.com/p/money-often-costs-too-much-a-look)

Both companies have spent most of the past 15 years putting up impressive revenue growth rates, and these dynamics have attracted competitors.  

在过去15年的大部分时间里，两家公司都实现了令人印象深刻的收入增长率，这些动态吸引了竞争对手。  

There are a few well-funded ($100 million-plus) payments companies that have already gotten a foothold in the market and are growing quickly to challenge Adyen and Stripe:  

有几家资金雄厚（1亿美元以上）的支付公司已经在市场上站稳脚跟，并正在快速增长，以挑战Adyen和Stripe：

-   [Rapyd](https://www.rapyd.net/) is a Tel Aviv-based payments provider doing more than $20 billion in TPV for more than 12,000 small- and medium-sized businesses and platforms as of [August 2021](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/rapyd-raises-300m-on-8-75b-valuation-as-fintech-as-a-service-continues-to-boom/#:~:text=Rapyd's%20total%20payment%20volume%20is,another%20650%20large%20enterprise%20clients.).  
    
    Rapyd是一家总部位于特拉维夫的支付提供商，截至2021年8月，它为12,000多家中小型企业和平台提供了超过200亿美元的TPV服务。
-   [Mollie](https://www.mollie.com/) is an Amsterdam-based payments provider estimated to be processing €20 billion-plus in payment volume for 120,000 monthly active merchants as of [June 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/22/payments-startup-mollie-now-third-biggest-fintech-in-europe.html#:~:text=Mollie%20said%20it%20processed%20more,500%20new%20customers%20a%20day.).  
    
    Mollie是一家总部位于阿姆斯特丹的支付服务提供商，截至2021年6月，预计将为12万个月活跃商户处理超过200亿欧元的支付量。
-   [Finix](https://finix.com/) is a San Francisco-based payments provider moving billions of dollars a year for more than 12,000 monthly active merchants as of [May 2022](https://finix.com/resources/blogs/reintroducing-finix-payfac-for-platform-payments) (disclaimer: I was an early employee and executive at Finix).  
    
    Finix是一家总部位于旧金山的支付提供商，截至2022年5月，每年为超过12，000家每月活跃的商户移动数十亿美元（免责声明：我是Finix的早期员工和高管）。

Those are just some of the payments companies that have reached a meaningful scale as of 2023. In 2021, a [record amount of funding](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/payments-trends-2021/) flowed from global venture capital funds to payments startups. Adyen was founded in 2006 and Stripe in 2010. If the latest batch of payments startups evolve on a similar timeframe, it won’t be clear whether those investments will bear fruit until the end of this decade.   

这些只是截至2023年已达到有意义规模的支付公司中的一部分。2021年，全球风险投资基金流向支付初创企业的资金规模创下历史新高。Adyen成立于2006年，Stripe成立于2010年。如果最新一批支付初创公司也在类似的时间框架内发展，那么这些投资是否会在本世纪末之前结出果实还不得而知。

All of these companies will do fine. Fundamentally, payments infrastructure is a [many-winner market](https://nbt.substack.com/p/many-winner-markets). There are few network effects. The capital investments required and economics of scale may mean that some entrants are scared off, but when global revenue for an industry is measured in the trillions, [as it is for payments](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-2021-mckinsey-global-payments-report), there’s usually plenty of revenue to go around for a handful of players. There are also secular forces—like the increasing adoption of e-commerce—that are pushing digital payments forward.  

所有这些公司都会做得很好。从根本上说，支付基础设施是一个多赢家的市场。几乎没有网络效应。所需的资本投资和规模经济可能意味着一些进入者会被吓跑，但当一个行业的全球收入以万亿计时，就像支付一样，通常会有大量的收入分配给少数几个参与者。还有一些长期的力量--比如电子商务的日益普及--正在推动数字支付向前发展。  

My best guess is that the payments infrastructure market can accommodate several winners in each region and category (and combinations thereof). May the best payments companies win.   

我的最佳猜测是，支付基础设施市场可以容纳每个地区和类别（及其组合）的几个赢家。愿最好的支付公司获胜。

## Questionable capital allocation  

资本配置存疑

For most of its history, Stripe’s research and development (R&D) strategy has been focused on supporting its core payments offering.  

在其历史的大部分时间里，Stripe的研发战略一直专注于支持其核心支付产品。  

It didn’t launch many new products, opting instead to invest in the basics: improving uptime and reliability, expanding internationally, and adding new payment methods.  

它没有推出很多新产品，而是选择投资于基础产品：提高正常运行时间和可靠性、国际扩张以及添加新的支付方式。  

Of the new products it did launch, Stripe Connect (payments for platforms and marketplaces), Radar (a payments fraud engine), Atlas (a business creation tool), and Identity (an identity verification tool) resulted in more merchants using Stripe’s core payments offering.  

在它推出的新产品中，Stripe Connect（平台和市场支付）、Radar（支付欺诈引擎）、Atlas（商业创建工具）和Identity（身份验证工具）导致更多商家使用Stripe的核心支付产品。  

Products like Stripe Terminal (software and devices used to accept payments in the physical world) and Billing (a subscription billing management tool) helped Stripe win and keep deals, like Glossier, over Adyen, FIS, or Fiserv, which could already handle in-person payments and complex recurring billing scenarios.  

Stripe Terminal（用于在现实世界中接受支付的软件和设备）和Billing（订阅计费管理工具）等产品帮助Stripe赢得并保持了Glossier等交易，而Adyen、FIS或Fiserv已经可以处理面对面支付和复杂的重复计费场景。

The strategy seems to have changed around 2018 with the launch of products like Stripe Corporate Card, Issuing (a platform to create virtual and physical pre-paid cards), Treasury (a banking-as-a-service product), and Financial Connections (a data aggregation tool), which are only tangentially related to card-based payments acceptance—from where most of Stripe’s revenue is assumed to come.  

2018年前后，随着Stripe公司卡、发行（创建虚拟和实体预付卡的平台）、财资（银行即服务产品）和Financial Connections（数据聚合工具）等产品的推出，该战略似乎发生了变化，这些产品与基于卡的支付受理只有一点关系-a据推测，Stripe的大部分收入都来自于该卡。  

Stripe has not released much information about the usage of its products, so it’s difficult to tell if these investments have been worthwhile, but ostensibly they expand its total addressable market by generating non-payments revenue.  

Stripe没有发布太多关于其产品使用情况的信息，因此很难说这些投资是否值得，但表面上看，它们通过产生非支付收入扩大了其整个可寻址市场。

This level of investment in non-payments offerings requires a lot of people. Stripe’s headcount ballooned to 8,000 employees in the fall of 2022 before it laid off 14% of its staff. Adyen, by comparison, had only 2,575 employees at the end of the first half of 2022.  

这种非支付产品的投资水平需要很多人。2022年秋季，Stripe的员工人数激增至8,000人，随后裁员14%。相比之下，Adyen在2022年上半年末仅有2,575名员工。  

This difference in headcount appears to be the main driver of the profitability difference between the two companies. Last month, [The Information reported](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stripes-revenue-growth-slid-last-year-as-firm-burned-through-cash?rc=kwzn2x) that Stripe was burning a “meaningful amount of cash for the first time and was also unprofitable when measured by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).  

这一员工数量上的差异似乎是两家公司盈利能力差异的主要驱动因素。上个月，The Information报道称，Stripe“首次消耗了大量现金，以息税折旧摊销前利润（EBITDA）衡量，也没有盈利。“  

The cash burn reflected investments in new projects aimed at producing more revenue in areas outside of payments.”  

现金消耗反映了对新项目的投资，这些项目旨在在支付以外的领域产生更多收入。”

At the same time, Stripe’s core payments offering wasn’t necessarily benefiting from the larger workforce. For example, in February 2022, Stripe was selected to be the first payment platform to offer [Apple’s new Tap to Pay](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/02/apple-unveils-contactless-payments-via-tap-to-pay-on-iphone/) to beta users on iPhone. But by July, it was actually Adyen that made the [functionality available to the general public](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymason/2022/07/14/adyen-is-first-to-launch-new-generation-of-tap-to-pay-iphone-software-at-scale-slipping-past-stripe/?sh=1f532b1e22cb). Stripe’s Tap to Pay product just came out of a limited beta in early 2023. You’d expect an R&D-focused company like Stripe to be first to market with new payment methods like Tap to Pay—otherwise, what is all that headcount for?  

与此同时，Stripe的核心支付产品并不一定受益于更大的员工队伍。例如，2022年2月，Stripe被选为首家向iPhone测试用户提供苹果新推出的Tap to Pay的支付平台。但到了7月，实际上是Adyen向公众提供了这些功能。Stripe的Tap to Pay产品在2023年初刚刚完成了限量测试。你会期望像Stripe这样专注于研发的公司率先推出新的支付方式，如点击支付，否则，所有的员工是干什么的？

Stripe has also been investing in smaller companies—another form of R&D.  

Stripe也一直在投资小公司--这是另一种形式的研发。  

It led an $8 million funding round for Nigeria-based Paystack, co-led a $40 million Series B for Tel Aviv-based payments provider Rapyd, and led a $12 million Series A for Philippines-based payment platform PayMongo.  

它为尼日利亚的Paystack牵头了一轮800万美元的融资，为特拉维夫的支付提供商Rapyd共同牵头了一轮4000万美元的B轮融资，并为菲律宾的支付平台PayMongo牵头了一轮1200万美元的A轮融资。  

On the surface, these deals make sense, as they support Stripe’s core payments acceptance offering, just in different regions. In 2020, Stripe acquired Paystack for $200 million. Investors could take issue with Stripe’s use of funds for an investment that may not bear fruit until [2040 or beyond](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/), but investment as outsourced R&D seems to have worked in Stripe’s favor.  

从表面上看，这些交易是有意义的，因为它们支持Stripe的核心支付受理服务，只是在不同的地区。2020年，Stripe以2亿美元收购了Paystack。投资者可能会对Stripe将资金用于一项可能要到2040年或以后才能结出果实的投资提出异议，但作为外包研发的投资似乎对Stripe有利。

Other investments are decidedly less advantageous to Stripe. Take Rapyd, for example.  

其他投资对Stripe来说显然没有那么有利。以拉皮德为例。  

After bringing on Stripe as an investor in 2019, the company went on to raise a total of $770 million and acquire two European-based payments processors, bringing it into direct competition with Stripe.  

在2019年引入Stripe作为投资者后，该公司继续筹集了总计7.7亿美元的资金，并收购了两家总部位于欧洲的支付处理器，使其与Stripe展开直接竞争。  

I wouldn’t think that seeding its own European competition was the intended goal of Stripe’s venture capital initiative.   

我不认为Stripe的风险投资计划的预期目标是在欧洲竞争中播种自己的种子。

Stripe has also invested in companies that directly compete with its products. There’s one-click checkout company Fast, [which burned through](https://marker.medium.com/fast-an-autopsy-290447bcb4f3) $120 million in venture funding in only a few years and competes with Stripe’s own products, Checkout (a low-code payment integration used to quickly collect payments information) and Link (an online checkout tool that automatically detects when a customer has previously saved payment and shipping details).  

Stripe还投资了与其产品直接竞争的公司。有一家叫“一键结账”的公司Fast，它在短短几年内就烧掉了1.2亿美元的风险投资，与Stripe自己的产品Checkout（一种低码支付集成，用于快速收集支付信息）和Link（一种在线结账工具，可以自动检测客户之前何时保存了支付和发货细节）展开竞争。  

Stripe also began investing in corporate card startup Ramp in 2021. Just 18 months earlier, Stripe had announced its own corporate card, which it still offers today.  

2021年，Stripe还开始投资商务卡初创公司Ramp。就在18个月前，Stripe宣布推出自己的公司卡，至今仍在提供。  

Aside from being a questionable use of capital to pursue both strategies at the same time, I can’t imagine morale on the Stripe Corporate Card or Checkout team was high the day it was announced their employer was leading a funding round in a direct competitor.  

除了使用资本同时追求这两种战略是值得怀疑的之外，我无法想象在宣布他们的雇主正在领导一个直接竞争对手的融资轮的那天，条纹公司卡或结账团队的士气是高涨的。

Stripe’s capital allocation outside of supporting its core payments offering is confusing at best—not ideal for a company that is increasingly being compared to Adyen, which has a history of profitability, rapid growth, and zero acquisitions.  

Stripe在支持其核心支付产品之外的资本配置充其量也只是令人困惑--对于一家越来越多地被拿来与Adyen相提并论的公司来说，这并不理想，Adyen有着盈利、快速增长和零收购的历史。  

Whether appropriate or not, professional investors are expecting Stripe’s R&D, headcount, and EBITDA margin profile to look like Adyen’s eventually. Unfortunately, Stripe’s EBITDA margins in 2022 were [reported](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stripes-revenue-growth-slid-last-year-as-firm-burned-through-cash?rc=kwzn2x) to be negative due to investment in non-payments products and the workforce required to support them.   

不管合适与否，专业投资者都预计Stripe的研发、员工人数和息税前利润率最终会像Adyen一样。遗憾的是，由于对非支付类产品的投资以及支持这些产品所需的劳动力，Stripe 2022年的EBITDA利润率被报道为负值。

Regardless, anticipating Stripe’s inevitable public stock offering, investor Max Friedrich of _AR_K Invest put together a [valuation model](https://twitter.com/mfriedrichARK/status/1618746051024031744) that has Stripe achieving a $92 billion valuation—close to its 2021 valuation of $95 billion—only if it can achieve Adyen-caliber EBITDA margins of 60%. By comparison, legacy player Fiserv’s most recently reported operating margin was 34.1%.   

无论如何，预计到Stripe不可避免的公开募股，方舟Invest的投资者马克斯·弗里德里希（Max Friedrich）构建了一个估值模型，认为Stripe只有在达到60%的Adyen口径EBITDA利润率的情况下，才能实现920亿美元的估值--接近其2021年950亿美元的估值。相比之下，老牌球员费塞夫最近公布的营业利润率为34.1%。

Yet there’s reason to believe the company will turn a profit again if it reigns in spending. CEO Patrick Collison [recently shared](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stripes-revenue-growth-slid-last-year-as-firm-burned-through-cash?rc=kwzn2x) that 2021 was the first time the company was unprofitable and “has cumulatively consumed less than $150 million after 12 years of operation.” But even if Stripe returns to its [traditional](https://twitter.com/mfriedrichARK/status/1618746051024031744?s=20&t=Beuehv6knRzDzvvWif2jmg) operating margins of 20%-30%, the company could be worth only about $30-$45 billion when it goes public, according to _AR_K’s model.   

然而，有理由相信，如果该公司控制住支出，它将再次扭亏为盈。CEO帕特里克·科里森近日分享称，2021年是公司首次出现无利可图的情况，“运营12年累计消耗不到1.5亿美元”。但根据方舟的模型，即使Stripe恢复到传统的20%-30%的营业利润率，该公司上市时的市值可能也只有300亿-450亿美元左右。

## Can Stripe win?  

花脸能赢吗

When we’ll see a Stripe public offering is anyone’s guess. The company is [reportedly](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stripe-walks-tightrope-to-stay-private-could-other-firms-follow) taking steps to give employees liquidity by selling stock to private investors rather than go public (disclaimer: I am a Stripe shareholder). This hasn’t stopped some on Twitter—[in earnest](https://twitter.com/adamnash/status/1619888130403995648?s=20&t=4KzS9rjEaMOaG_a1EwU_CQ) and [in jest](https://twitter.com/ashleymayer/status/1622257141615665153?s=20&t=Xc_up9MeRCqLQ098A7VvUA)—from hoping the company will go public sooner rather than later to open up the public markets for other startups.   

什么时候我们会看到条纹公开募股是任何人的猜测。据报道，该公司正在采取措施，通过向私人投资者出售股票而不是上市，为员工提供流动性（免责声明：我是Stripe的股东）。这并没有阻止Twitter上的一些人--无论是认真的还是开玩笑的--希望该公司尽早上市，为其他初创公司打开公共市场。

That’s a lot of pressure for a payments company, especially one that has its work cut out for it.  

这对一家支付公司来说压力很大，尤其是一家有工作要做的公司。  

Stripe faces increasingly tough competition from Adyen, legacy players, and upstarts; is suffering from declining revenue growth due to structural changes in consumer behavior and advertising technologies; and must get its spending under control after years of investing in non-payments products and companies that haven’t always worked out.  

Stripe面临着来自Adyen、传统玩家和新贵的日益激烈的竞争;由于消费者行为和广告技术的结构性变化而遭受收入增长下降;而且在多年投资于非支付产品和公司并不总是成功之后，必须控制好支出。

But Stripe will turn it around. They can’t lose, right?  

但花脸会扭转局势的。他们不会输的，对吧？
