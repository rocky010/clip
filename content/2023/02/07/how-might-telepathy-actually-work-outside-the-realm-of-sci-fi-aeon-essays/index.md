In a letter he wrote in 1884, Mark Twain lamented that ‘Telephones, telegraphs and words are too slow for this age; we must get something that is faster.  

马克吐温在1884年的一封信中哀叹道："电话、电报和文字对这个时代来说太慢了;我们得找个更快的。  

’ We should (in the future) communicate, he said, ‘by thought only, and say in a couple of minutes what couldn’t be inflated into words in an hour and a-half.’  

他说，我们（将来）应该只通过思想交流，用几分钟的时间说出一个半小时无法用语言表达的东西。

Fast-forward to 2020, and Elon Musk suggests in an interview that by using his ‘neural net’ technology – a lace-like mesh implanted in the brain – we ‘would, in principle \[be\] able to communicate very quickly, and with far more precision, ideas and language.  

时间快进到2020年，埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）在一次采访中表示，通过使用他的"神经网络"技术--一种植入大脑的花边状网状结构--我们"原则上能够非常迅速地交流思想和语言，而且准确度要高得多。"  

’ When asked by his interviewer, Joe Rogan: ‘How many years, before you don’t have to talk?’ Musk responds: ‘If the development continues to accelerate, then maybe, like, five years – five to 10 years.’  

当他的采访者乔·罗根问他："多少年以后，你才能不说话？"马斯克回应：他说，如果发展继续加快，那么可能需要五年左右--五到十年。

Despite the very real progress the previous century brought for our understanding of both language and the brain, we are no closer to telepathy than we were in Twain’s time.  

尽管上个世纪我们对语言和大脑的理解都取得了真正的进步，但我们并不比吐温时代更接近心灵感应。  

The reason, we will argue, is that the telepathy we’ve been promised – the sort envisaged by Twain and Musk, and popularised in countless movies and TV shows – rests on a faulty premise.  

我们会说，原因在于，我们被许诺的心灵感应--吐温和马斯克设想的那种，在无数电影和电视节目中流行的那种--建立在一个错误的前提上。

‘Good old-fashioned telepathy’ (GOFT) involves a direct transfer of thoughts from one mind to another. It has captivated people for a few reasons. First, it bypasses the limitations and vicissitudes of language.  

"好的老式心灵感应"（GOFT）涉及思想从一个头脑到另一个头脑的直接转移。它吸引人们有几个原因。首先，它绕过了语言的局限性和变迁。  

With GOFT, we no longer need to struggle to put each concept into words or to decode someone’s language.  

有了GOFT，我们不再需要费力地把每个概念用语言表达出来，或者解码某人的语言。  

This bypassing of language is a central feature of GOFT; it is what licenses science-fiction writers to imagine humans and aliens communicating telepathically despite not sharing a language, culture or biology.  

这种对语言的回避是GOFT的一个中心特征;正是这一点使科幻小说家能够想象人类和外星人尽管没有共同的语言、文化或生物学，但仍能通过心灵感应进行交流。

Second, GOFT promises more precise and genuine communication. The ambiguity of language is legion. We all have experiences of saying one thing, only to be understood as saying something else (and those are just the miscommunications we were alerted to!) Because language is so [flexible](https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-the-english-spelling-system-so-weird-and-inconsistent), it is also easy to lie and contradict oneself. These apparent shortcomings have, for centuries, inspired [inventions](http://inthelandofinventedlanguages.com/) of artificial languages that try to remove ambiguity and duplicity. A direct thought-to-thought transfer would seem the ultimate solution.  

第二，GOFT承诺更准确和真实的沟通。语言的模糊性是很多的。我们都有过说一件事，却被理解为说另一件事的经历（而那些只是我们被提醒的错误沟通！）因为语言是如此的灵活，所以撒谎和自相矛盾也是很容易的。几个世纪以来，这些明显的缺点激发了人工语言的发明，试图消除歧义和口是心非。一个直接的思想到思想的转移似乎是最终的解决方案。

Finally, GOFT promises faster communication. Many of us have the intuition that we can think faster than we can speak or write, and that having to rely on language to communicate is an impediment.  

最后，GOFT承诺更快的通信。我们中的许多人都有这样的直觉：我们思考的速度比我们说或写的速度快，而且必须依赖语言来交流是一种障碍。  

It is no coincidence that one of the aims of Neuralink, Musk’s neural-interfaces/telepathy start-up, is to allow humans to communicate at the speed of _thought_.  

马斯克的神经接口/心灵感应初创公司Neuralink的目标之一就是让人类以思维的速度进行交流，这并非巧合。

We are not even certain if Bob’s mental state could be interpreted by Bob himself in a year’s time  

我们甚至不能确定鲍勃的精神状态是否能在一年后被鲍勃自己解读出来

At the root of GOFT, however, is a problem. For it to work, our thoughts have to be aligned, to have a common format. Alice’s thoughts beamed into Bob’s brain need to be understandable to Bob. But would they be?  

然而，GOFT的根源是一个问题。为了使它发挥作用，我们的思想必须一致，必须有一个共同的格式。传送到鲍勃大脑中的爱丽丝的想法必须是鲍勃可以理解的。但他们会吗？  

To appreciate what real alignment actually entails, consider machine-to-machine communication that takes place when Bob sends an email to Alice.  

为了理解真实的的一致性实际上意味着什么，考虑一下当鲍勃给爱丽丝发送电子邮件时发生的机器对机器的通信。  

For this seemingly simple act to work, Bob and Alice’s computers have to encode letters in the same way (otherwise an ‘a’ typed by Bob would render as something different for Alice). The protocols used by Bob’s and Alice’s machines for _transmitting_ the information (eg, SMTP, POP) also have to be matched. If that email has an attached photo, additional alignment must exist to ensure that the receiving machine can decode the image format (eg, JPG) used by the sender.  

为了让这个看似简单的动作起作用，鲍勃和爱丽丝的计算机必须以相同的方式对字母进行编码（否则鲍勃键入的“a”对爱丽丝来说会呈现为不同的内容）。Bob和Alice的机器用于传输信息的协议（例如SMTP、POP）也必须匹配。如果该电子邮件有一个附加的照片，额外的对齐必须存在，以确保接收机器可以解码的图像格式（如JPG）使用的发件人。  

It is these formats (known collectively as encodings and protocols) that allow machines to ‘understand’ one another. These formats are the products of deliberate engineering and they required universal buy-in.  

正是这些格式（统称为编码和协议）允许机器相互“理解”。这些格式是精心设计的产物，需要普遍接受。  

Just as postal systems around the world had to agree to honour each other’s stamps, companies and governments had to agree to use common encodings such as Unicode and protocols such as TCP/IP and SMTP.  

就像世界各地的邮政系统必须同意承认彼此的邮票一样，公司和政府必须同意使用统一码等通用编码以及TCP/IP和SMTP等协议。

But is there any reason to think that our _thoughts_ are aligned in this way? At present, we have no reason to imagine that the neural activity constituting Bob’s thought – for example, _I’m in the mood for some truffle risotto_ – would make any sense to anyone other than Bob (indeed, we are not even certain if Bob’s mental state could be interpreted by Bob himself in a year’s time). How then does Bob communicate his risotto desires to Alice? The obvious solution is to use a natural language like [English](https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-english-so-weirdly-different-from-other-languages). To be useful, these systems have to be learned. But, once learned, they allow us to use a common set of symbols (English words) to token particular thoughts in the minds of other English speakers.  

但是，有什么理由认为我们的思想是以这种方式联系在一起的呢？目前，我们没有理由认为，构成鲍勃思想的神经活动--例如，我想吃松露意大利调味饭--对除了鲍勃以外的任何人都有意义（事实上，我们甚至不确定鲍勃自己是否能在一年后解释鲍勃的精神状态）。那么鲍勃是如何把他对意大利调味饭的渴望传达给爱丽丝的呢？显而易见的解决办法是使用像英语这样的自然语言。要想有用，这些系统必须被学习。但是，一旦学会了，它们就允许我们使用一组共同的符号（英语单词）来表征其他英语使用者头脑中的特定想法。

It is tempting to assume that the reason why language works as well as it does is that our thoughts are already aligned and language is just a way of communicating them: our thoughts are ‘packaged’ into words and then ‘unpacked’ by a receiver. But this is an illusion.  

我们很容易认为，语言之所以能如此有效，是因为我们的思想已经统一，而语言只是一种交流方式：我们的思想被“打包”成文字，然后被接收器“拆包”。但这是一种错觉。  

It is telling that even _with_ natural language, conceptual alignment is hard work and drops off without actively using language.  

很明显，即使使用自然语言，概念对齐也是一项艰苦的工作，如果不积极使用语言，概念对齐就会下降。

Natural languages thus accomplish a version of what machine protocols and encodings do – they provide a common protocol that (to some extent) bridges the varied formats of our thoughts. Language on this view does not depend on prior conceptual alignment, it helps create it.  

因此，自然语言完成了机器协议和编码的一个版本--它们提供了一个公共协议，（在某种程度上）连接了我们思想的各种格式。这种观点的语言并不依赖于先前的概念一致性，而是帮助创造它。

Would it be possible to _create_ alignment between our thoughts? Some way to transforms Bob’s mental state into some form that is compatible with Alice’s or, better yet, with everyone’s thoughts? Let’s consider three possible solutions.  

有没有可能在我们的思想之间建立一种联系？有没有办法把鲍勃的精神状态转变成某种形式，使之与爱丽丝的精神状态相适应，或者更好的是，与每个人的思想相适应？让我们考虑三种可能的解决方案。

The first is to transform our thoughts into a natural language like English. Rather than beaming raw thoughts from one mind to another, we beam words instead. This could work.  

第一是把我们的思想转化为像英语这样的自然语言。我们不是把原始的想法从一个头脑传送到另一个头脑，而是传送文字。这可能行得通。  

But of course everyone involved would need to already a share a language like English, turning telepathy into a fancy form of texting.  

当然，每个人都需要共享一种语言，比如英语，把心灵感应变成一种奇特的短信形式。

The second is to computationally transform raw mental states into some common format – a universally understandable ‘language of thought’. As of right now, there is no reason to think that such a transformation is possible.  

第二种是通过计算将原始的心理状态转换成某种通用格式--一种普遍可理解的“思想语言”。到目前为止，没有理由认为这样的转变是可能的。  

But it is conceivable to us that such a system can be used to transmit general states – eg, distinguishing _Yes!_ vs _Meh…_ – and perhaps mental images. But we don’t see how this method would work to transmit arbitrary thoughts – a main promise of GOFT.  

但我们可以想象，这样一个系统可以用来传递一般状态--例如，区分是！vs Meh... -也许还有心理意象。但是我们看不出这种方法是如何传输任意思想的--这是GOFT的一个主要承诺。

Is this genuine communication or a somewhat macabre remote-control?  

这是真正的交流还是有点恐怖的遥控器？

The third is to map specific thoughts to specific meanings in a predetermined way, creating a kind of ‘telepathese’. As it happens, modern attempts at telepathic communication (of which there are now a few) are just such attempts. Let’s take a look at two.  

第三种是以预定的方式将特定的思想映射到特定的意义上，创造出一种“心灵感应”。碰巧的是，现代心灵感应交流的尝试（现在有几种）就是这样的尝试。我们来看两个。

In a [study](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111332) in 2014, a team of researchers lead by the computer scientist Rajesh Rao paired people to jointly play a game, trying to fire a virtual cannon to defend a city from enemy rockets.  

在2014年的一项研究中，由计算机科学家拉杰什·拉奥领导的一个研究小组将人们配对，共同玩一个游戏，试图发射一门虚拟大炮来保卫一座城市免受敌人的火箭袭击。  

In each pair, one person (the ‘sender’) could see a screen showing the position of the target but could not fire the cannon. The other person, the ‘receiver’, could not see the screen, but could press the ‘fire’ button.  

在每一组中，一个人（“发送者”）可以看到显示目标位置的屏幕，但不能发射大炮。另一个人，“接收者”，看不到屏幕，但可以按下“发射”按钮。  

The two players were linked with a brain-to-brain interface created by connecting the sender to an electroencephalograph (EEG) – a device for measuring small voltage fluctuations evoked by brain activity using electrodes placed on the scalp.  

这两个玩家通过一个脑对脑的接口连接起来，这个接口是通过将发送者连接到脑电图仪（EEG）上而创建的，EEG是一种通过放置在头皮上的电极来测量大脑活动引起的微小电压波动的设备。  

These voltages were then used to trigger magnetic pulses in a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) machine positioned near the receiver’s scalp.  

这些电压然后被用来触发磁脉冲在经颅磁刺激（TMS）机器放置在附近的接收者的头皮。  

These magnetic pulses, when delivered to the part of the scalp overlying a specific part of the motor cortex, produced muscle contractions that, in this case, caused the receiver to press the ‘fire’ button.  

当这些磁脉冲被传送到覆盖在运动皮层特定部分上的头皮部分时，会产生肌肉收缩，在这种情况下，会导致接收器按下“发射”按钮。

Let’s put aside the question of whether this is genuine communication or a somewhat macabre remote-control. One could imagine a more finessed version in which the magnetic pulse only suggests rather than causes the firing action.  

让我们先把这是真正的交流还是有点可怕的遥控器的问题放在一边。人们可以想象一个更巧妙的版本，其中磁脉冲只建议而不是导致发射动作。  

But however much we finesse it, the information being exchanged is highly specific, and meaningful only in this specific context after having briefed the sender and receiver (using a natural language) on how the game works.  

但是，无论我们如何巧妙地处理它，所交换的信息都是非常具体的，只有在向发送者和接收者（使用自然语言）简要介绍了游戏如何运作之后，才在这个特定的背景下有意义。  

The message being sent through the EEG signal is not a thought or idea. Rather, it is, quite literally, the motor command that would ordinarily drive the sender’s hand muscles to contract.  

通过脑电图信号发送的信息不是思想或想法。更确切地说，它是运动指令，通常会驱动发送者的手部肌肉收缩。

Is there a way to extend this type of brain-to-brain interface so that it is less tied to a specific game? In a [study](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0105225) published the same year, the psychologist Carles Grau and colleagues also coupled a ‘sender’ and a ‘receiver’ using an EEG/TMS rig. Senders were instructed to imagine either moving their hands or their feet.  

有没有一种方法可以扩展这种类型的脑对脑接口，使其不那么依赖于特定的游戏？在同一年发表的一项研究中，心理学家卡尔斯·格劳（Carles Grau）和同事们还使用脑电图/经颅磁刺激设备将“发送者”和“接收者”联系起来。发送者被要求想象移动他们的手或脚。  

The resulting EEG patterns can be distinguished and used either to trigger a TMS coil to stimulate a receiver’s visual cortex, or to deliver a pulse that did not produce phosphenes.  

由此产生的EEG模式可以被区分，并用于触发TMS线圈以刺激接收者的视觉皮层，或用于传递不产生光幻视的脉冲。  

So what we have is a setup where a sender can think a thought (eg, imagining her feet or hands moving), which causes a receiver to perceive or not perceive a phosphene. This method can, in principle, be used to communicate arbitrary information.  

因此，我们有一个设置，发送者可以思考一个想法（例如，想象她的脚或手移动），这导致接收者感知或不感知光幻视。原则上，这种方法可用于传递任意信息。  

For example, one can use Morse code: ‘hello’ becomes ……-.. .-.. — (where hand imagery is a dot, and arm imagery is a dash). This is, of course, slow and error-prone, but the real problem is that this too is not GOFT.  

例如，可以使用莫尔斯电码：“你好”变成了...... -.. .-.. - （其中，手部图像为点，手臂图像为破折号）。当然，这很慢而且容易出错，但真实的的问题是这也不是GOFT。  

Although we are now closer to the signals being ‘thoughts’, their meanings need to be prearranged, either falling back on English words (such as brain-to-brain texting using Morse code) or requiring senders and receivers to learn a new protocol, such as associating a particular pattern of on/off signals with a particular object.  

尽管我们现在更接近于将信号称为“思想”，但它们的含义需要预先安排，要么回到英语单词（如使用莫尔斯电码的脑对脑短信），要么要求发送者和接收者学习一种新的协议，如将特定模式的开/关信号与特定对象相关联。  

Here again, we already have such a protocol that we learn in infancy: language. From telepathic communication to telepathic coordination.  

同样，我们在婴儿期就已经有了这样一个协议：语言。从心灵感应交流到心灵感应协调。

We have so far taken a dim view of the possibility of telepathy that assumes our thoughts are aligned. There are some ways of aligning our thoughts, perhaps by training people to use highly specific protocols of the sort used by Grau and colleagues.  

到目前为止，我们对心灵感应的可能性持悲观态度，认为我们的思想是一致的。有一些方法可以调整我们的思维，也许可以通过训练人们使用格劳和同事们使用的那种非常具体的协议。  

But by requiring alignment in advance, many of the key benefits of telepathy threaten to be lost. Instead of being able to communicate with people using our thoughts alone, we must first be trained on, essentially, how to be more alike.  

但是，由于需要提前调整，心灵感应的许多关键好处可能会失去。我们不能够仅仅用我们的思想与人交流，我们首先必须接受训练，从本质上说，如何更相似。  

Instead of gaining a new window on alien ways of thinking and reasoning, this form of telepathy would work only if almost everything was already the same (hence well-aligned).  

这种形式的心灵感应并不能打开一扇了解外星人思维和推理方式的新窗户，只有在几乎所有东西都已经相同的情况下（因此是对齐的），它才能起作用。

But perhaps there is hope for telepathy – or something like it – yet. For there is another way of thinking about telepathy that suggests intriguingly different avenues for empirical research and experiment.  

但也许心灵感应--或类似的东西--还有希望。因为还有另一种思考心灵感应的方式，它为经验研究和实验提供了有趣的不同途径。  

To see what we have in mind, it helps to take a step back and ask what language is for in the first place. One possibility – the one that seems most in line with our reflections on alignment – is that it is a means of sharing thoughts and information between individuals.  

为了了解我们的想法，退一步想想语言最初是用来做什么的，这会有所帮助。一种可能性--似乎最符合我们对一致性的思考--是它是个体之间分享思想和信息的一种手段。  

But information-sharing is beneficial only insofar as it leads to different actions. This opens up a different way of thinking about language and about the prospects for (a kind of new-fangled) telepathy.  

但是，信息共享只有在导致不同行动的情况下才是有益的。这为我们提供了一种思考语言和（一种新型的）心灵感应前景的不同方式。

Instead of viewing communication between people as a transfer of information, we can think about it as a series of actions we perform on one another (and often on ourselves) to bring about effects.  

我们不应将人与人之间的沟通视为信息的传递，而应将其视为我们为了产生效果而对彼此（通常也对自己）采取的一系列行动。  

The goal of language, thus understood, is not (or is not always) alignment of mental representations, but simply the informed coordination of action. On this picture, successful uses of language need not demand conceptual alignment.  

如此理解，语言的目标并不是（或并不总是）心理表征的一致性，而仅仅是行动的知情协调。在这种情况下，成功地使用语言并不需要概念上的一致性。  

This view of language as a lever for coordination, a tool for practical action, can be found in research by Andy Clark ([2006](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09515080600689872)), Mark Dingmanse ([2017](https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2237449_8/component/file_2388465/content)), Christopher Gauker ([2002](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262571623/words-without-meaning/)) and Michael Reddy ([1979](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/metaphor-and-thought/conduit-metaphor-a-case-of-frame-conflict-in-our-language-about-language/073475BB85C2B7553047D1D29F62C2E2)).  

这种将语言作为协调杠杆、实际行动工具的观点可以在安迪·克拉克（2006）、马克·丁曼斯（2017）、克里斯托弗·高克（2002）和迈克尔·雷迪（1979）的研究中找到。

By way of analogy, consider the _notion_ of ‘inter-operability’ but applied to gross physical abilities. Two people of very different heights and weights can [cooperate](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.02039) to move a piece of furniture around some tight corners [together](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2005.12.009). They might even signal to each other along the way. For this to work, the signals need to bring about the right kinds of bodily effect, perhaps pushing at one end or raising the item in the air.  

通过类比，考虑“互操作性”的概念，但适用于总的身体能力。两个身高和体重差异很大的人可以合作一起在一些狭窄的角落里移动一件家具。他们甚至可能沿着路上互相发信号。要做到这一点，信号需要产生正确的身体效应，也许是推动一端或将物品举到空中。  

But, beyond that, there is no need for conceptual (let alone phenomenal) alignment at all, apart from having a shared goal. Practical alignment is all that matters.  

但是，除此之外，除了有一个共同的目标之外，根本不需要概念上的（更不用说现象上的）一致。实际的一致性才是最重要的。

Linked people then carry out various joint projects: they work on school assignments, move couches, fall in love  

然后，联系人开展各种联合项目：他们做作业搬沙发谈恋爱

Viewing language as a lever for practical coordination, the prospects for (something a bit like) telepathy start to look different.  

把语言看作是实际协调的杠杆，（有点像）心灵感应的前景开始看起来不同了。  

Instead of viewing telepathy as potential means to communicate our inner thoughts and experiences, transferring them from one mind to another, we can think of telepathy in terms of new channels of causal influence: channels that might one day be exploited to coordinate joint actions.  

我们不把心灵感应看作是交流我们内心想法和经验的潜在手段，把它们从一个头脑转移到另一个头脑，我们可以把心灵感应看作是因果影响的新渠道：有一天可能被用来协调联合行动的渠道。  

Existing brain-to-brain interfaces could play this role even if they are congenitally unable (due to the lack of sufficient conceptual alignment) to act as a kind of direct transmitter of the content of one person’s mental representations to another.  

现有的脑-脑接口可以发挥这种作用，即使它们先天无法（由于缺乏足够的概念对齐）充当一个人的心理表征内容向另一个人的直接传递者。

With this in mind, imagine now an alternative version of the sender-receiver setups used in Rao’s and Grau’s studies.  

记住这一点，现在想象一下拉奥和格劳研究中使用的发送器-接收器设置的另一种版本。  

Instead of instructing people to induce a particular mental state to communicate a predetermined meaning, there is simply a two-way brain-to-brain channel opened up between two or more individuals at a young age.  

它不是指示人们诱导特定的心理状态来传达预定的意义，而是在年轻时在两个或更多的个体之间开辟了一条双向的脑对脑通道。  

The linked people then carry out various joint projects: they work on school assignments, move couches, fall in love. Might their brains learn to make use of the new channel to help them achieve their goals? This seems (to us, at least) to verge into more plausible territory.  

然后，联系人开展各种联合项目：他们做作业，搬沙发，谈恋爱他们的大脑会不会学会利用新的通道来帮助他们实现目标？这似乎（至少在我们看来）正在接近一个更合理的领域。  

Something similar seems to occur when two people, or even a human and a pet, learn to pick up on body language as a clue to what the other person is thinking or intending to do.  

当两个人，甚至是一个人和一只宠物，学会把肢体语言作为另一个人在想什么或打算做什么的线索时，类似的事情似乎也会发生。  

There, too, a different channel – in this case, vision – with a different target (small bodily motions) conveys an extra layer of useable information – and one not easily replicated by other means.  

在那里，一个不同的通道--在这个例子中是视觉--也有不同的目标（微小的身体运动），传递了一个额外的有用信息层--而这个信息层是不容易被其他手段复制的。

Any new, initially purposeless, brain-to-brain channel could be variously configured, conveying traces recorded from different neural areas, or averaged across many such areas.  

任何新的、最初没有目的的脑-脑通道都可以被不同地配置，传送从不同神经区域记录下来的轨迹，或者在许多这样的区域上平均。  

It would be a matter of trial and error to discover what kinds of configuration work best, and for what purposes.  

这将是一个反复试验的问题，以发现哪种配置工作最好，以及用于什么目的。  

But the goal of these new bridges would not be to bypass either person’s intentions (as in designs like Rao’s), so much as to enhance the basis upon which they each form and implement their intentions.  

但是，这些新桥梁的目标不是绕过任何一方的意图（就像拉奥的设计那样），而是加强他们各自形成和实现意图的基础。

To our knowledge, this kind of experiment has never been performed on humans or any other animals. Something like it was imagined, though, by the neuro-philosopher Paul Churchland. In his [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262531061/a-neurocomputational-perspective/) _A Neurocomputational Perspective_ (1989), Churchland imagined a hockey team that trained and played with direct wireless brain-to-brain links in place. Such a team might benefit from the very rapid transfer of signals carrying information of many kinds.  

据我们所知，这种实验从未在人或其他动物身上进行过。然而，神经哲学家保罗·丘奇兰（Paul Churchland）曾设想过类似的情况。丘奇兰德在他的著作《神经计算的视角》（A Neurocalcomputational Perspective，1989）中设想了一个曲棍球队，他们在训练和比赛时都有直接的无线脑-脑连接。这样一个团队可能会受益于携带多种信息的信号的非常快速的传输。  

Perhaps, Churchland speculated, the players would learn ways of understanding each other that were far superior to those made possible by normal linguistic communication.  

丘奇兰推测，也许玩家们会学到比正常语言交流更上级的相互理解的方法。  

This is because he regarded public language as a limited and impoverished means of communication – one whose job might be done much better by some form of direct brain-to-brain link. Our view, by contrast, is that the power _both_ of public language _and_ of any future brain-to-brain bridging lies in their ability to act as levers for joint action, while papering over differences in underlying representational spaces.  

这是因为他认为公共语言是一种有限的、贫乏的交流手段--通过某种形式的脑与脑的直接联系，它的工作可能会做得更好。相比之下，我们的观点是，公共语言和未来任何脑与脑之间的桥梁的力量都在于它们能够充当联合行动的杠杆，同时掩盖潜在表征空间中的差异。

Importantly, there is reason to think that human brains possess the kinds of flexibility and plasticity required to make good use of new kinds of channel, and/or of channels carrying new kinds of information.  

重要的是，我们有理由认为，人类大脑具有灵活性和可塑性，能够很好地利用新型通道和/或携带新型信息的通道。  

A simple example is the NorthSense – a small silicon device that is attached to the chest and delivers a short vibration when the user is turned towards magnetic North.  

一个简单的例子是NorthSense --一个附着在胸部的小型硅设备，当用户转向磁北时，它会发出短暂的振动。  

Users report quite rapidly starting to just ‘know’, moment by moment, their orientation relative to important distant places such as their home or their children’s school-gates.  

用户报告说，他们很快就开始每时每刻地“知道”他们相对于重要的遥远地方（如他们的家或他们孩子的学校大门）的方位。  

In this way, a constant drip-feed of new directional information is rapidly assimilated into the cognitive ecology of the wearer.  

通过这种方式，新的方向信息的持续滴馈被快速吸收到佩戴者的认知生态中。

Or consider sensory substitution technologies. A blind person’s cane delivers a stream of information that can be used to aid object-identification and localisation.  

或者考虑一下感官替代技术。盲人的手杖传递了一系列信息，这些信息可以用来帮助识别和定位物体。  

But for a higher bandwidth experience, a head-mounted camera linked to an electrical grid attached to the tongue can deliver patterns of electrical stimulation that bear information about the distance and shape of out-of-reach objects: information that can be used to [drive](https://doi.org/10.1097/WNR.0b013e3283462def) object-recognition and apt action. There are also commercially available systems that deliver visual information using patterns of sound rather than touch – for [example](https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(03)00290-0?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1364661303002900%3Fshowall%3Dtrue), devices such as [EyeMusic](https://doi.org/10.3233/RNN-130338). In all these cases, subjects attempt to perform various actions and, as they do so, the resulting video feeds are translated into touch, electrical stimulations, or sound.  

但要获得更高带宽的体验，一个连接到舌头上电网的头戴式摄像机可以传递电刺激模式，这些模式承载着遥不可及物体的距离和形状信息：可用于驱动对象识别和APT动作的信息。还有一些商用系统使用声音模式而非触摸来传递视觉信息--例如，EyeMusic等设备。在所有这些情况下，受试者尝试执行各种动作，当他们这样做时，产生的视频反馈被转换为触摸、电刺激或声音。  

With time and practice, it is possible to learn the signature patterns characteristic of different encountered objects, distinguishing plants from statues, crosses from circles, and so on.  

随着时间的推移和实践，我们有可能学会不同物体的特征模式，区分植物和雕像，十字架和圆圈，等等。

Such technologies remain limited in their scope and require extensive training to master. But they are an [important](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep15628) proof of principle, nonetheless. Human brains are plastic organs able to make use of information-bearing signals of many kinds.  

这些技术的范围仍然有限，需要大量培训才能掌握。但无论如何，它们是一个重要的原则证明。人类大脑是可塑性器官，能够利用多种承载信息的信号。  

Our standard human repertoire of sensing may be simply the starter-pack for our eventual modes of contact, both with other people and with the wider world.  

我们标准的人类感知系统可能只是我们与他人和更广阔世界的最终接触模式的启动包。

Viewed in this way, it may be productive to think about telepathy as being less about learning a new language and more like learning a new motor skill, such as juggling, or perhaps something more sophisticated, like learning to dance or riding a trial bike.  

从这个角度来看，把心灵感应看作是学习一门新语言，而不是学习一种新的运动技能，比如杂耍，或者更复杂的东西，比如学习跳舞或骑自行车，这可能是有益的。  

In such cases, the right kind of practice lets us do something radically new, expanding our usual repertoire in ways whose best uses might be discovered much later.  

在这种情况下，正确的练习方式可以让我们做一些全新的事情，扩展我们的常规技能，其最佳用途可能会在很久以后才被发现。

We have argued that the prospects for good old-fashioned telepathy are poor. GOFT requires our thoughts to have a common format, such that the thought of one person is understandable to another. The chances that such a format exists are remote.  

我们认为老式的心灵感应的前景并不乐观。GOFT要求我们的思想有一个共同的格式，这样一个人的思想可以被另一个人理解。这种形式存在的可能性微乎其微。  

And trying to establish it by using natural language largely defeats the purpose of telepathy, turning it into little more than fancy texting.  

而试图通过使用自然语言来建立它在很大程度上违背了心灵感应的目的，使它只不过是花哨的短信。

But despite our pessimism regarding the direct transmission of thoughts or experiences, the prospect of adding new direct brain-to-brain channels is an exciting one.  

但是，尽管我们对思想或经验的直接传递持悲观态度，增加新的直接脑-脑通道的前景是令人兴奋的。  

By providing multiple new channels of this kind, our plastic brains may be ‘let loose’ to discover new and potent ways to coordinate practical actions. Our current accomplishments in art, science and culture required the efficient coordination made possible by natural language.  

通过提供多个此类新渠道，我们的可塑性大脑可能会“释放”，以发现新的和有效的方式来协调实际行动。我们目前在艺术、科学和文化方面的成就需要自然语言使之成为可能的有效协调。  

New brain-to-brain channels have the potential to augment those existing capabilities, turning us into super-cooperators, and transforming life and society in ways we cannot yet imagine.  

新的脑-脑通道有可能增强现有的能力，将我们变成超级合作者，并以我们无法想象的方式改变生活和社会。
