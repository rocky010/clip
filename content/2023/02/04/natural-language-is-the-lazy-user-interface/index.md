_See the discussion of this post on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34549378).  

请参阅 Hacker News 上对这篇文章的讨论。_

_ChatGPT_ has kicked off a frenzy. It is all anyone in the tech world is talking about it seems. Startups are popping up left and right. Big companies are rapidly releasing _ChatGPT_\-like features integrated in their products.  

_ChatGPT_ 掀起了一阵狂潮。这似乎是科技界所有人都在谈论的话题。初创公司如雨后春笋般涌现。大公司正在迅速发布集成在其产品中的类似 _ChatGPT_ 的功能。

People are anticipating that large language models are going to revolutionize the world.  

人们期待大型语言模型将彻底改变世界。

And maybe they will.  

也许他们会的。

But a chat bot won't.  

但是聊天机器人不会。

Expecting users to primarily interact with software in natural language is _lazy_.  

期望用户主要使用自然语言与软件交互是懒惰的。

It puts all the burden on the user to articulate good questions. What to ask, when to ask it, how to ask it, to make sense of the response, and then to repeat that many times.  

它把所有的负担都放在用户身上，以表达好的问题。问什么，什么时候问，怎么问，理解回答，然后重复很多次。

**But a user may not know what they don't know.  

但是用户可能不知道他们不知道什么。**

A good user interface let's me iteratively and incrementally explore the problem and solution space in a variety of ways.  

一个好的用户界面可以让我以各种方式迭代和渐进地探索问题和解决方案空间。

A great user interface guides me and offers nudges.  

一个很棒的用户界面可以指导我并提供帮助。

Couldn't a natural language interface help with that?  

自然语言界面不能帮助解决这个问题吗？

Certainly.  

当然。

But not as the only option. Probably not even the main interface.  

但不是唯一的选择。可能连主界面都没有。

The need to support multiple modalities isn't new—it just seems we are so awestruck by LLMs that new software features are launching that regress to a single modality.  

支持多种模式的需求并不新鲜——似乎我们对 LLM 如此震惊，以至于新的软件功能正在推出，回归到单一模式。

_Just slap a textbox on it!  

只需在上面打一个文本框！_

The potential of LLMs goes far beyond a natural language interface.  

LLM 的潜力远远超出了自然语言界面。

For example, an application could feed the relevant context to the model behind the scenes and use that to preemptively suggest what I should do next. The toolbar could adapt to my specific task. Dialog boxes wouldn't have to be so static.  

例如，应用程序可以在幕后将相关上下文提供给模型，并使用它来预先建议我下一步应该做什么。工具栏可以适应我的特定任务。对话框不必如此静态。  

I could point to a region of the screen and ask for an explanation. It could identify a misunderstanding before I do (see my prior work on [inquisitive interfaces](https://austinhenley.com/blog/inquisitivecodeeditor.html)). The system could show me examples based on what I'm doing. Tutorials could take on a personality that better suits me.  

我可以指着屏幕的某个区域并要求解释。它可以在我之前识别出误解（请参阅我之前关于好奇界面的工作）。该系统可以根据我正在做的事情向我展示示例。教程可以采用更适合我的个性。

The least it could do is intelligently give me a starting point for typing in a prompt. The tyranny of the blank textbox is real.  

它至少可以智能地为我提供输入提示的起点。空白文本框的暴政是真实的。

Because like my colleague recently said to me:  

因为就像我的同事最近对我说的：

> "people are bad at words"  
> 
> “人不善言辞”
