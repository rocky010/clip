## I

I’ve never had anything like a real career, only a long and varied string of jobs. I grew up working on the family farm, and then had jobs as a roofer, a groundskeeper at a rural hospital, and a mineral-bagging-machine operator in an unheated feed mill one frigid Manitoba winter.  
我从来没有像真正的职业那样的东西，只有一长串各种各样的工作。我从小在家庭农场工作，然后在马尼托巴寒冷的冬天做过屋顶工，在一家乡村医院做过场地管理员，在一个没有暖气的饲料厂做过矿物装袋机操作员。  
I spent a year as a photographer and store manager in a tiny portrait studio just as digital cameras were beginning to consign film cameras to obsolescence. I worked for three years as a barista at one of Vancouver’s top-rated independent coffee shops.  
当数码相机开始让胶片相机过时时，我在一家小型肖像工作室担任摄影师和商店经理一年。我在温哥华顶级独立咖啡店之一担任咖啡师三年。  
I’ve been a magazine editor, a sessional lecturer in a couple of liberal arts schools, a glazier’s assistant, a mason tender, a plumber’s labourer, and a daycare worker. One winter I lived in a simple little cabin—no plumbing, no electricity—and I made homemade soap over a wood stove and sold it at _craft_ sales. In my twenties and thirties I spent many of my summers planting close to half a million trees on countless logging clear-cuts between Hyder, Alaska, and Dryden, Ontario.  
我当过杂志编辑、几所文科学校的临时讲师、玻璃工助理、泥瓦工、水管工和日托工人。有一个冬天，我住在一间简陋的小木屋里——没有水管，也没有电——我用柴火炉自制肥皂，然后在手工艺品销售会上出售。在我二三十岁的时候，我度过了许多夏天，在阿拉斯加海德尔和安大略省德莱顿之间无数的伐木空地上种植了近 50 万棵树。

And for twelve years now I’ve had a hybrid operation, juggling a one-man autodidact home-repair business and part-time lay ministry at a little Anglican church in Winnipeg. My basic MO in both roles is simple: repair and remain.  
十二年来，我一直在进行混合操作，在温尼伯的一个小圣公会教堂兼顾一个人的自学家庭维修业务和兼职外行事工。我在这两个角色中的基本 MO 很简单：修复并保持。

I don’t have the know-how to build you a brand-new house, but I can help fix pretty much anything in your old one. If you do, in fact, need a new house, I’ll send you to Francesco or Myron, or James and Fiona, all of them trustworthy builders and fine people.  
我不知道如何为您建造全新的房子，但我可以帮助您修理旧房子中的几乎所有东西。如果你真的需要一所新房子，我会把你送到弗朗切斯科或迈伦，或者詹姆斯和菲奥娜那里，他们都是值得信赖的建筑商和优秀的人。  
Odds are the house you’re in right now needs a few updates and minor upgrades, and I’d be happy to help with whatever you need done: add some new windows, open up some walls, replace the old basement stairs, tile the backsplash. Repair and remain.  
很可能您现在所在的房子需要一些更新和小的升级，我很乐意帮助您完成任何需要做的事情：添加一些新窗户、打开一些墙壁、更换旧的地下室楼梯、铺瓷砖后挡板。修而留。

Same with pastoring: no point thinking you need a brand-new life, but, well, let’s not kid around—you could use some serious updates and upgrades yourself.  
与牧师相同：没有必要认为你需要全新的生活，但是，好吧，我们不要开玩笑——你可以使用一些严肃的更新和升级自己。

Let’s say time comes to gut and renovate your bathroom: I can help you with that—demolition, framing, reworking the plumbing, moving some electrical, installing some mould-resistant drywall, maybe some nice tile for the floor and some classic glazed ceramic three-by-six subway tile for the tub surround.  
假设是时候彻底翻新你的浴室了：我可以帮你做这件事——拆除、加框、改造管道、移动一些电器、安装一些防霉石膏板、也许一些漂亮的地板砖和一些经典的釉面陶瓷三- 用于浴缸环绕的六乘地铁瓷砖。  
Should take a month or two, depending on what all’s involved.  
应该需要一两个月的时间，具体取决于所涉及的内容。  
And as for you, hey, for the sake of your wife and kids, I think you better quit the flurry of furtive late-night texts to the sexy young co-worker and cut back a bit on your recreational drinking because wine is a mocker, so goes the proverb, as if those Facebook posts of you at the bar last week weren’t proof enough.  
至于你，嘿，为了你的妻子和孩子，我认为你最好停止在深夜偷偷摸摸地给性感的年轻同事发短信，少喝点酒，因为酒是一种嘲弄, 谚语也是如此，好像你上周在酒吧里的那些 Facebook 帖子还不足以证明。

Repair and remain. Work with what you’ve got. Sit still for a moment, take stock, make some changes. Big changes, if necessary.  
修而留。用你所拥有的工作。静坐片刻，盘点一下，做出一些改变。如有必要，进行大的更改。

### Repair and remain. Work with what you’ve got. Sit still for a moment, take stock, make some changes. Big changes, if necessary.

David and Ruth called me once to unclog their bathroom sink.  
大卫和露丝有一次打电话给我，帮我疏通他们的浴室水槽。  
Someone had dropped a nail clipper into it a decade ago, but now the drain was rusted and when I went to loosen the nut, the steel sink cracked and split, but it was an old sink so I couldn’t find a matching one to replace it with, so that meant the old vanity had to go too, but that left an odd footprint on the curled, old linoleum, so then the flooring had to go too, and, well, if you’re going that far, you might as well put in a new tub. And so on.  
十年前有人把指甲刀掉进去了，但现在下水道生锈了，当我去松开螺母时，钢制水槽裂开了，但这是一个旧水槽，所以我找不到合适的取而代之，这意味着旧的梳妆台也必须拆除，但是在卷曲的旧油毡上留下了奇怪的脚印，所以地板也必须拆除，而且，好吧，如果你要走那么远，你还不如换个新浴缸。等等。  
You get the picture. Renominoes. In the end, a house call to help deal with a bathroom sink with a nail clipper jammed in it led to six weeks’ work and a bill in the teens with three zeros.  
你明白了。雷诺米诺斯。最后，一个上门求助来帮助处理一个浴室水槽，里面有一个指甲刀卡在里面，这导致了六个星期的工作和一个十几岁的三个零的账单。

Last year, in the middle of the pandemic, a man I haven’t seen in more than fifteen years called me up to weep on the phone because he was having a difficult time loving his kids.  
去年，在大流行期间，一个我十五年多没见过的男人打电话给我哭了，因为他很难爱他的孩子。  
He had started to feel resentment toward them because, he said, the kids had taken so much away from him he barely knew who he was anymore. “I called you because I knew you’d be gentle with me,” he said. That I can do.  
他开始对他们产生怨恨，因为，他说，孩子们从他身上夺走了太多东西，他几乎不知道自己是谁了。 “我打电话给你是因为我知道你会对我很温柔，”他说。我能做到的。

Six years ago a guy I barely knew cornered me after church and asked if I could meet him for breakfast, and when we met, he told me he was _this_ close to walking out on his wife and kids. Since then, he and I have been meeting up every couple of months or so. Last year he told me he wouldn’t still be married if it weren’t for all those conversations over greasy bacon and eggs over easy.  
六年前，一个我几乎不认识的人在教堂后把我逼到墙角，问我能不能和他一起吃早餐，当我们见面时，他告诉我他差点离开他的妻子和孩子。从那以后，我和他每隔几个月左右就会见面一次。去年他告诉我，如果不是因为那些关于油腻的培根和鸡蛋的谈话太简单了，他就不会结婚了。  
Well and good, I say, but the truth is he’s the one doing the hard work. He’s the one who’s got to live his life. All I have to do is buy breakfast, and sit, and listen.  
很好，我说，但事实是他是那个努力工作的人。他是必须过自己生活的人。我所要做的就是买早餐，然后坐下来听。

Repair and remain.  
修而留。

That’s how I work, and it’s what I advise. I don’t know how things are going to turn out in your life or in your marriage or with your kids. Nobody does. Maybe it will all get a whole lot worse, who’s to say.  
这就是我的工作方式，也是我的建议。我不知道你的生活、你的婚姻或你的孩子会如何发展。没有人这样做。也许一切都会变得更糟，谁说呢。  
But a brand-new house won’t fix your troubles any more than a fresh start with a fascinating new somebody will.  
但是一栋崭新的房子并不能解决你的问题，就像一个迷人的新人重新开始一样。  
Don’t tell me; I already know it would be easier to just cut and run, because I know how hard it is to live with other people, four of whom are also stuck having to live with brooding, melancholy me.  
不要告诉我；我已经知道直接逃跑会更容易，因为我知道和其他人一起生活是多么困难，其中四个人也不得不和沉思、忧郁的我一起生活。  
I have planted spruce saplings on the steep, thorny, overgrown slopes of the Rocky Mountains in snowstorms in June. I once heaved a three-hundred-pound cast-iron tub up and out the second-story window of an old house.  
六月的暴风雪中，我在落基山脉陡峭、多刺、杂草丛生的山坡上种下了云杉树苗。有一次，我把一个三百磅重的铸铁浴缸从一栋老房子的二层窗户里举了出来。  
And when I worked for a bricklayer, he and I took down a concrete-and-rebar-reinforced cinderblock wall with sledgehammers. But this—doing my best to be a loving husband and father in the trauma and tedium of the day-to-day—is without question the hardest thing I’ve ever done.  
当我为一名瓦工工作时，他和我用大锤拆除了一堵混凝土和钢筋加固的煤渣砌块墙。但这——在日常的创伤和乏味中尽我最大的努力成为一个慈爱的丈夫和父亲——毫无疑问是我做过的最艰难的事情。

Over the past dozen years I have had hundreds of pastoral conversations, mostly with young men, about the challenges of family life.  
在过去的十几年里，我进行了数百次关于家庭生活挑战的牧养谈话，主要是与年轻人进行的。  
They tell me it’s exhausting, that there’s no more free time, that they’re having a hard time setting aside their dreams and wishes, that kids can be unbearably frustrating. I get it.  
他们告诉我这让人筋疲力尽，没有更多的空闲时间，他们很难把梦想和愿望搁置一旁，孩子们可能会令人难以忍受地沮丧。我知道了。  
They tell me that the marriage isn’t what it used to be, that they don’t really have anything in common anymore, that the passion’s gone, that she isn’t who she used to be, that the sex isn’t what it used to be, that they’re tired of all of it. I sip my coffee and nod in agreement with every word.  
他们告诉我，这段婚姻已今非昔比，他们不再有任何共同点，激情已经消失，她不再是从前的她，性不再是过去过去，他们厌倦了这一切。我啜了一口咖啡，点头同意每一个字。  
I understand. I feel it too. It’s the same at my house. Marriage is hard.  
我明白。我也感觉到了。我家也一样。婚姻是艰难的。

But when they say, “I’m thinking of leaving,” I think, Now hang on a sec. You had me right up to that last bit. Fine: you’ve changed; she’s changed; life has changed. And the kids—well, they’ve disrupted, interrupted, confronted, confounded, and otherwise fundamentally altered _everything_. All very, very hard. And yes, sometimes it feels impossible. I know what it’s like to feel trapped, and my wife undoubtedly knows what it’s like to feel trapped, because she’s stuck with me, [the more irritable and moody ingredient](https://comment.org/varieties-of-the-noonday-demon/) in our marriage. But you’re thinking of leaving? What is that going to fix?  
但是当他们说“我正在考虑离开”时，我想，现在等一下。你让我一直到最后一点。很好：你变了；她变了；生活改变了。而孩子们——好吧，他们打乱了、打断了、面对了、困惑了，或者从根本上改变了一切。一切都非常非常艰难。是的，有时感觉不可能。我知道被困住是什么感觉，我妻子无疑知道被困住是什么感觉，因为她和我在一起，我是我们婚姻中更易怒和喜怒无常的成分。但是你在考虑离开吗？那要解决什么问题？

We have, all of us and to varying degrees, been duped by the sales pitches, the flashing cascade of advertisements traipsing through the sidebar.  
我们所有人都在不同程度上被销售宣传、侧边栏上闪闪发光的广告所欺骗。  
That jam-packed flow of ads is full of shiny new things, new techniques, new experiences that promise to finally alleviate the so-far insatiable, burning, lonely, primordial ache. Bono laments, “I still haven’t found what I’m looking for.” Springsteen cries out, “Everybody’s got a hungry heart.” k.d.  
拥挤的广告流中充满了闪亮的新事物、新技术和新体验，它们有望最终缓解迄今为止无法满足的、燃烧的、孤独的、原始的痛苦。博诺感叹道，“我仍然没有找到我要找的东西。”斯普林斯汀喊道：“每个人都有一颗饥饿的心。” k.d.

lang bemoans the “constant craving.” Augustine says, “Our hearts are restless.”  
朗哀叹“不断的渴望”。奥古斯丁说：“我们的心是不安的。”

I used to blame advertisers for that restlessness and dissatisfaction, but I don’t think that’s right. We were already restless; we always have been.  
我曾经把这种不安和不满归咎于广告商，但我认为那是不对的。我们已经坐立不安了；我们一直都是。  
The advertisers just figured out how to nurture, tend, exacerbate, and capitalize on the pre-existing condition, that innate restlessness, promising that something new is going to set all to rights.  
广告商只是想出了如何培养、照料、加剧和利用先前存在的条件，即与生俱来的不安，承诺新事物将使一切恢复正常。  
When the flashing sidebar connects that hand lotion, those hiking boots, a beach vacation, or some rugged SUV with satisfaction, joy, and inner peace, it sure _feels_ like we’d be suckers _not_ to buy it. And when that thing inevitably disappoints, we hardly even notice. There’s always something new to buy. That narrative of elusive satisfaction isn’t just something we’re repeatedly being told; it is a story we’re literally buying into all the time.  
当闪烁的侧边栏连接着洗手液、登山靴、海滩度假或坚固耐用的 SUV 时，我们会感到满足、快乐和内心平静，如果不买它，我们肯定会觉得很傻。当那件事不可避免地令人失望时，我们几乎不会注意到。总有新东西要买。这种难以捉摸的满足感的叙述不仅仅是我们反复被告知的事情；这是一个我们一直在接受的故事。  
No surprise, then, that when our beloved to whom we once upon a time “pledged our troth” inevitably disappoints, we start thinking it might be time to get a new beloved.  
毫不奇怪，当我们曾经“发誓”向我们所爱的人不可避免地失望时，我们开始认为可能是时候换一个新的爱人了。

### That narrative of elusive satisfaction isn’t just something we’re repeatedly being told; it is a story we’re literally buying into all the time.  
这种难以捉摸的满足感的叙述不仅仅是我们反复被告知的事情；这是一个我们一直在接受的故事。

I have come to think that renovation work is not inherently a sign of fashion-driven, bourgeois, consumerist excess; that beauty is not superfluous; and that a good renovation is a good investment. Taking care of your house is a wise and pragmatic thing to do.  
我开始认为，装修工作本身并不是时尚驱动的、资产阶级的、消费主义过度的标志；美丽不是多余的；良好的装修是一项很好的投资。照顾好你的房子是一件明智而务实的事情。  
The integrity of a house means that all the parts and systems work as a whole, from ridge cap to footing and everything in between.  
房屋的完整性意味着所有部件和系统作为一个整体工作，从屋脊盖到地基以及介于两者之间的一切。  
Roof trusses, studs, joists, shiplap, plumbing supply and waste, eaves, windows, flooring, faucets, switches: your house will function as a house when it is well built and well maintained. Integrity of form, function, usability, and beauty.  
屋顶桁架、立柱、托梁、搭叠板、管道供应和废物、屋檐、窗户、地板、水龙头、开关：如果建造和维护得当，您的房子就会像房子一样发挥作用。形式、功能、可用性和美观的完整性。  
If it’s poorly made, or when it starts to fall apart, the integrity of the whole thing suffers. Give it enough time and a leak in the roof or a leak from a drain will ruin the whole thing.  
如果制作不当，或者当它开始分崩离析时，整个事物的完整性就会受到影响。给它足够的时间，屋顶漏水或排水管漏水都会毁了整个事情。

If you ignore the little things long enough, something as small as a nail clipper can make for two days of demolition and a trailer filled with an old sink, outdated vanity, faded linoleum, some lath and plaster, old plumbing, a thirsty old toilet, and so on.  
如果你忽视这些小东西的时间足够长，像指甲刀这样小的东西就可以拆除两天，拖车里装满了旧水槽、过时的梳妆台、褪色的油毡、一些板条和石膏、旧管道、一个干渴的旧马桶， 等等。  
I can haul those few thousand pounds of junk to the landfill and rebuild your bathroom. But in the end, when it’s all put back together again, what you have will still be the spot to do the same basic grooming and human-waste disposal.  
我可以把那几千磅的垃圾运到垃圾填埋场并重建你的浴室。但最后，当一切重新组合起来时，你所拥有的仍然是进行相同的基本梳理和排泄物处理的场所。  
Pay attention and mind the details and you save yourself a lot of hassle and money. That slow corrosion that comes if you ignore the small, nagging troubles of your life has the potential to wreck a family the way a nail clipper can wreck a bathroom.  
注意并注意细节，您可以省去很多麻烦和金钱。如果你忽视生活中那些小而烦人的麻烦，那么缓慢的腐蚀就会像指甲刀破坏浴室一样破坏一个家庭。  
And somebody’s going to pay for it, even if it isn’t you. Mostly it will be the kids, plus the ongoing emotional and spiritual costs divvied up among the friends, family, and community who witnessed your vows, who backed you as you struggled along, who loved you then and still love you now.  
有人会为此付出代价，即使不是你。主要是孩子们，加上持续的情感和精神成本，这些成本由见证你誓言的朋友、家人和社区分摊，他们在你奋斗的过程中支持你，他们曾经爱你，现在仍然爱你。

Because however it may sometimes seem that circumstance, fortune, and your exasperating spouse are conspiring to sabotage your happiness and peace of mind, the one certain, irrefutable common factor in all your circumstances is you.  
因为无论环境、财富和令人恼火的配偶有时看起来如何共同破坏你的幸福和心灵的平静，在你所有的环境中，一个确定的、无可辩驳的共同因素就是你。  
You are the bearer and carrier of grief, disappointment, frustration, and heartache, just as you are also the source of much of the same. So it goes. I’ve said it more than once to some guy across the table who tells me he’s planning to leave his marriage: You should stay.  
你是悲伤、失望、沮丧和心痛的承担者和载体，就像你也是许多相同事物的源头一样。就这样吧。我不止一次对桌子对面的某个人说过这句话，他告诉我他打算离开他的婚姻：你应该留下来。  
Sit in the awful, agonizing sorrow of it all, and figure some things out. Your life is very hard. I know you’ve thought it through more than I can imagine; I know you’ve calculated the cost-benefit, weighed your options; and all that is fine and good.  
坐在可怕的、痛苦的悲伤中，想出一些事情。你的生活很艰难。我知道你想的比我想象的要多；我知道您已经计算了成本效益，权衡了您的选择；一切都很好。  
There is no way of knowing how this will play out in your very real life. Nobody can predict the future. Something has to give, yes. But it doesn’t need to be this. [I think you should stay](https://ifstudies.org/blog/should-couples-in-unhappy-marriages-stay-together).  
无法知道这将如何在您的真实生活中发挥作用。没有人能预测未来。有些东西必须给予，是的。但不一定是这样。我认为你应该留下来。

It’s a tough sell. I understand, because my undisciplined imagination, formed like everyone else’s by countless half-minute ads and building-sized billboards, frolics among fantastic, glamorous possibilities of something other than what I’ve already got.  
这是一个艰难的销售。我明白，因为我的想象力就像其他人一样，是由无数半分钟的广告和建筑物大小的广告牌形成的，在我已经拥有的东西之外的奇妙、迷人的可能性中嬉戏。  
It’s a cornucopia of options, with countless cathedrals and priests promising salvation at the marketplace, be it a new app, new phone, new car, new house, new job, new city, or new spouse. The promise is always the same: _this_ thing will make you happy. Never mind trying to fix what you’ve got. Just get a new one and start over.  
这是一个选择的聚宝盆，无数的大教堂和牧师承诺在市场上拯救，无论是新应用程序、新手机、新车、新房子、新工作、新城市还是新配偶。承诺总是一样的：这件事会让你快乐。没关系试图修复你所拥有的。换一个新的，然后重新开始。

Repair and remain sounds simple because it is. But simple is not the same as easy. “For better, for worse,” we say, and everyone likes to stay when it’s the better. But staying through the worse—that’s the whole point of the vow, for Christ’s sake.  
修复并保持听起来很简单，因为它确实如此。但简单并不等同于简单。 “无论好坏，”我们说，而且每个人都喜欢在更好的时候留下来。但为了基督的缘故，熬过最坏的情况——这就是誓言的全部意义。

### Repair and remain sounds simple because it is. But simple is not the same as easy.  
修复并保持听起来很简单，因为它确实如此。但简单并不等同于简单。

Mostly they do what they’ve already decided to do, and they leave. My track record for counselling couples to stick it out is pretty poor. I still think the better part of wisdom says stay. Endure. Wrestle. Suffer. Struggle. Keep working.  
大多数情况下，他们会做他们已经决定要做的事情，然后离开。我在辅导夫妻坚持下去方面的记录非常糟糕。我仍然认为智慧的更好部分是留下来。忍受。搏斗。遭受。斗争。继续工作。  
Your heart is restless, my heart is restless, all our hearts are restless, “until they find their rest in Thee”—a rest that may well be found in full only after our death. So be it. Until then: stay.  
你的心不安，我的心不安，我们所有人的心都不安，“直到他们在你里面找到安息”——只有在我们死后才能完全安息。随它吧。在那之前：留下来。
