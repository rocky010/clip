The internet is a copy machine. At its most foundational level, it copies every action, every character, every thought we make while we ride upon it.  

互联网是一台复制机。在其最基本的层面上，它复制了我们的每一个行动、每一个角色、每一个思想，而我们则在它上面驰骋。  

In order to send a message from one corner of the internet to another, the protocols of communication demand that the whole message be copied along the way several times. IT companies make a lot of money selling equipment that facilitates this ceaseless copying.  

为了将一条信息从互联网的一个角落发送到另一个角落，通信协议要求整个信息在途中被复制若干次。IT公司出售促进这种无休止复制的设备，赚了很多钱。  

Every bit of data ever produced on any computer is copied somewhere. The digital economy is thus run on a river of copies. Unlike the mass-produced reproductions of the machine age, these copies are not just cheap, they are free.  

任何计算机上产生的每一比特数据都会被复制到某个地方。因此，数字经济是在复制的河流上运行的。与机器时代大规模生产的复制品不同，这些复制品不仅便宜，而且是免费的。

Our digital communication network has been engineered so that copies flow with as little friction as possible.  

我们的数字通信网络经过设计，使副本的流动尽可能少有摩擦。  

Indeed, copies flow so freely we could think of the internet as a super-distribution system, where once a copy is introduced it will continue to flow through the network forever, much like electricity in a superconductive wire. We see evidence of this in real life.  

事实上，拷贝的流动是如此自由，我们可以把互联网看作是一个超级分销系统，一旦拷贝被引入，它将永远在网络中流动，就像超导电线中的电流。我们在现实生活中看到了这一点的证据。  

Once anything that can be copied is brought into contact with internet, it will be copied, and those copies never leave. Even a dog knows you can’t erase something once it’s flowed on the internet.  

一旦任何可以复制的东西接触到互联网，它就会被复制，而且这些复制永远不会离开。即使是狗也知道，一旦东西在互联网上流传，你就无法抹去它。

![Copy-Transmission](copy-transmission.jpg)

This super-distribution system has become the foundation of our economy and wealth.  

这种超级分配制度已经成为我们经济和财富的基础。  

The instant reduplication of data, ideas, and media underpins all the major economic sectors in our economy, particularly those involved with exports — that is, those industries where the US has a competitive advantage.  

数据、想法和媒体的即时重复是我们经济中所有主要经济部门的基础，特别是那些涉及出口的部门--也就是那些美国具有竞争优势的行业。  

Our wealth sits upon a very large device that copies promiscuously and constantly.  

我们的财富坐落在一个非常大的设备上，不断地乱复制。

Yet the previous round of wealth in this economy was built on selling precious copies, so the free flow of free copies tends to undermine the established order. If reproductions of our best efforts are free, how can we keep going?  

然而，这种经济的前一轮财富是建立在出售珍贵的复制品上的，所以免费复制品的自由流动往往会破坏既定秩序。如果我们最好的努力的复制品是免费的，我们怎么能继续下去？  

To put it simply, how does one make money selling free copies?  

简单地说，一个人如何通过出售免费拷贝来赚钱？

I have an answer. The simplest way I can put it is thus:  

我有一个答案。我可以这样说，最简单的方式是。

When copies are super abundant, they become worthless.  

当副本超级丰富时，它们就变得毫无价值。

When copies are super abundant, stuff which can’t be copied becomes scarce and valuable.  

当复制品超级多的时候，不能复制的东西就变得稀缺和有价值。

**When copies are free, you need to sell things which can not be copied.  

当拷贝是免费的时候，你需要出售不能被拷贝的东西。**

Well, what can’t be copied?  

那么，什么是不能复制的呢？

There are a number of qualities that can’t be copied. Consider “trust.” Trust cannot be copied. You can’t purchase it. Trust must be earned, over time. It cannot be downloaded. Or faked. Or counterfeited (at least for long).  

有一些品质是无法复制的。考虑一下 "信任"。信任是不能被复制的。你无法购买它。信任必须通过时间来赢得。它不能被下载。或伪造。或伪造（至少是长期的）。  

If everything else is equal, you’ll always prefer to deal with someone you can trust. So trust is an intangible that has increasing value in a copy saturated world.  

如果其他方面都一样，你总是喜欢和你可以信任的人打交道。因此，信任是一种无形的东西，在一个复制饱和的世界中具有越来越大的价值。

There are a number of other qualities similar to trust that are difficult to copy, and thus become valuable in this network economy.  I think the best way to examine them is not from the eye of the producer, manufacturer, or creator, but from the eye of the user.  

还有其他一些类似于信任的品质，难以复制，因此在这个网络经济中变得很有价值。 我认为研究它们的最佳方式不是从生产者、制造商或创造者的角度，而是从用户的角度。  

We can start with a simple user question:  why would we ever pay for anything that we could get for free? When anyone buys a version of something they could get for free, what are they purchasing?  

我们可以从一个简单的用户问题开始：为什么我们要为可以免费得到的东西付费？当有人购买他们可以免费得到的东西的版本时，他们购买的是什么？

From my study of the network economy I see roughly eight categories of intangible value that we buy when we pay for something that could be free.  

从我对网络经济的研究中，我看到大概有八类无形价值，当我们为一些可能是免费的东西付费时，我们会购买这些价值。

In a real sense, these are eight things that are better than free. Eight uncopyable values.  I call them “generatives.” A _generative_ value is a quality or attribute that must be generated, grown, cultivated, nurtured. A generative thing can not be copied, cloned, faked, replicated, counterfeited, or reproduced. It is generated uniquely, in place, over time.  

从真正意义上讲，这是比免费更好的八件事。八个不可复制的价值。 我称它们为 "生成物"。一个生成性的价值是一种必须生成、生长、培养、培育的质量或属性。一个生成性的东西不能被复制、克隆、伪造、复制、仿造或再现。它是随着时间的推移，独特地、就地生成的。  

In the digital arena, generative qualities add value to free copies, and therefore are something that can be sold.  

在数字领域，生成性品质为免费拷贝增加了价值，因此是可以被出售的东西。

**Eight** **Generative****s Better Than Free**  

胜过免费的八种代用品

**I****mmediacy** — Sooner or later you can find a free copy of whatever you want, but getting a copy delivered to your inbox the moment it is released — or even better, produced — by its creators is a generative asset.  

即时性--你迟早可以找到你想要的任何东西的免费拷贝，但在其创作者发布--甚至更好的是制作--的那一刻，得到一个拷贝送到你的收件箱，是一种生成的资产。  

Many people go to movie theaters to see films on the opening night, where they will pay a hefty price to see a film that later will be available for free, or almost free, via rental or download. Hardcover books command a premium for their immediacy, disguised as a harder cover.  

许多人在电影院开幕当晚去看电影，他们会花高价去看一部后来可以通过租赁或下载免费或几乎免费获得的电影。精装书因其即时性而获得溢价，伪装成硬封面。  

First in line often commands an extra price for the same good. As a sellable quality, immediacy has many levels, including access to beta versions. Fans are brought into the generative process itself.  

对于同样的商品，排在第一位的人往往可以获得额外的价格。作为一种可销售的质量，即时性有很多层次，包括获得测试版本。粉丝被带入生成过程本身。  

Beta versions are often de-valued because they are incomplete, but they also possess generative qualities that can be sold. Immediacy is a relative term, which is why it is generative. It has to fit with the product and the audience.  

测试版经常被贬低价值，因为它们不完整，但它们也拥有可以被出售的生成性。即时性是一个相对的术语，这就是为什么它是生成性的。它必须符合产品和受众的要求。  

A blog has a different sense of time than a movie, or a car. But immediacy can be found in any media.  

博客的时间感与电影或汽车不同。但即时性可以在任何媒体中找到。

**Personalization** — A generic version of a concert recording may be free, but if you want a copy that has been tweaked to sound perfect in your particular living room — as if it were preformed in your room — you may be willing to pay a lot.  

个性化 - 一个普通版本的音乐会录音可能是免费的，但如果你想要一个经过调整的拷贝，在你特定的客厅里听起来很完美--就像在你的房间里预演的一样--你可能愿意付出很多。  

  The free copy of a book can be custom edited by the publishers to reflect your own previous reading background. A free movie you buy may be cut to reflect the rating you desire (no violence, dirty language okay).  

一本免费的书可以由出版商定制编辑，以反映你自己以前的阅读背景。你购买的免费电影可能会被剪掉，以反映你想要的等级（没有暴力，脏话也可以）。  

Aspirin is free, but aspirin tailored to your DNA is very expensive. As many have noted, personalization requires an ongoing conversation between the creator and consumer, artist and fan, producer and user. It is deeply generative because it is iterative and time consuming.  

阿司匹林是免费的，但根据你的DNA定制的阿司匹林却非常昂贵。正如许多人所指出的，个性化需要创造者和消费者、艺术家和粉丝、生产者和用户之间的持续对话。它是深刻的生成性的，因为它是迭代的和耗时的。  

You can’t copy the personalization that a relationship represents. Marketers call that “stickiness” because it means both sides of the relationship are stuck (invested) in this generative asset, and will be reluctant to switch and start over.  

你无法复制一个关系所代表的个性化。营销人员称其为 "粘性"，因为它意味着关系的双方都坚持（投资）在这一生成的资产上，并且不愿意转换和重新开始。

**Interpretation** — As the old joke goes: software, free. The manual, $10,000. But it’s no joke. A couple of high profile companies, like Red Hat, Apache, and others make their living doing exactly that. They provide paid support for free software.  

解释 - 正如一个老笑话所说：软件，免费。手册，10,000美元。但这并不是玩笑。有几家高知名度的公司，如红帽、阿帕奇等，正是靠做这些事情为生。他们为自由软件提供付费支持。  

The copy of code, being mere bits, is free — and becomes valuable to you only through the support and guidance. I suspect a lot of genetic information will go this route. Right now getting your copy of your DNA is very expensive, but soon it won’t be.  

代码的拷贝，仅仅是比特，是免费的--只有通过支持和指导才会对你有价值。我怀疑很多遗传信息会走这条路。现在，获得你的DNA副本是非常昂贵的，但很快就不会了。  

In fact, soon pharmaceutical companies will PAY you to get your genes sequence. So the copy of your sequence will be free, but the interpretation of what it means, what you can do about it, and how to use it — the manual for your genes so to speak — will be expensive.  

事实上，很快制药公司就会付钱给你来获取你的基因序列。因此，你的序列副本将是免费的，但对它意味着什么的解释，你能做什么，以及如何使用它--可以说是你的基因手册--将是昂贵的。

**Authenticity** — You might be able to grab a key software application for free, but even if you don’t need a manual, you might like to be sure it is bug free, reliable, and warranted. You’ll pay for authenticity.  

真实性 - 你可能会免费抓到一个关键的软件应用程序，但即使你不需要手册，你也可能想确定它没有错误，可靠，并有保证。你要为真实性付费。  

There are nearly an infinite number of variations of the Grateful Dead jams around; buying an authentic version from the band itself will ensure you get the one you wanted. Or that it was indeed actually performed by the Dead. Artists have dealt with this problem for a long time.  

感恩而死的音乐几乎有无数种变化；从乐队本身购买一个真实的版本将确保你得到你想要的那个。或者说，它确实是由死亡乐队表演的。艺术家处理这个问题已经有很长一段时间了。  

Graphic reproductions such as photographs and lithographs often come with the artist’s stamp of authenticity — a signature — to raise the price of the copy.  

照片和石版画等图形复制品通常带有艺术家的真实性印章--签名，以提高复制品的价格。  

Digital watermarks and other signature technology will not work as copy-protection schemes (copies are super-conducting liquids, remember?) but they can serve up the generative quality of authenticity for those who care.  

数字水印和其他签名技术不会作为复制保护计划发挥作用（副本是超导液体，记得吗？），但它们可以为那些关心的人提供真实性的生成质量。

**Accessibility** — Ownership often sucks. You have to keep your things tidy, up-to-date, and in the case of digital material, backed up. And in this mobile world, you have to carry it along with you.  

可访问性--所有权往往很糟糕。你必须保持你的东西整洁、最新，如果是数字材料的话，还要进行备份。在这个移动的世界里，你必须随身携带它。  

Many people, me included, will be happy to have others tend our “possessions” by subscribing to them. We’ll pay Acme Digital Warehouse to serve us any musical tune in the world, when and where we want it, as well as any movie, photo (ours or other photographers).  

许多人，包括我在内，会很乐意让别人通过订阅来倾向于我们的 "财产"。我们会付钱给埃克姆数字仓库，让它在我们想要的时间和地点为我们提供世界上任何音乐曲调，以及任何电影、照片（我们的或其他摄影师的）。  

Ditto for books and blogs.  Acme backs everything up, pays the creators, and delivers us our desires. We can sip it from our phones, PDAs, laptops, big screens from where-ever.  

书籍和博客也是如此。 Acme为一切提供支持，向创作者支付报酬，并为我们提供我们想要的东西。我们可以从我们的手机、PDA、笔记本电脑、大屏幕上随时随地地品尝它。  

The fact that most of this material will be available free, if we want to tend it, back it up, keep adding to it, and organize it, will be less and less appealing as time goes on.  

事实上，这些材料中的大部分将可以免费获得，如果我们想倾向于它，支持它，不断增加它，并组织它，随着时间的推移，将越来越不吸引人。

**Embodiment** — At its core the digital copy is without a body. You can take a free copy of a work and throw it on a screen. But perhaps you’d like to see it in hi-res on a huge screen? Maybe in 3D?  

体现--数字拷贝的核心是没有身体。你可以把一个作品的免费拷贝扔在屏幕上。但也许你想在一个巨大的屏幕上看到它的高清晰度？也许是3D的？  

PDFs are fine, but sometimes it is delicious to have the same words printed on bright white cottony paper, bound in leather. Feels so good. What about dwelling in your favorite (free) game with 35 others in the same room? There is no end to greater embodiment.  

PDF文件很好，但有时将同样的文字印在明亮的白棉纸上，用皮革装订，也是一种美味。感觉好极了。在你最喜欢的（免费）游戏中与其他35人同住一室，感觉如何？更大的体现是没有尽头的。  

Sure, the hi-res of today — which may draw ticket holders to a big theater — may migrate to your home theater tomorrow, but there will always be new insanely great display technology that consumers won’t have. Laser projection, holographic display, the holodeck itself!  

当然，今天的高清晰度--可能会吸引票友去大剧院--明天可能会迁移到你的家庭影院，但总会有新的疯狂的伟大显示技术，消费者不会有。激光投影、全息显示、天幕本身！这些都是新技术。  

And nothing gets embodied as much as music in a live performance, with real bodies. The music is free; the bodily performance expensive. This formula is quickly becoming a common one for not only musicians, but even authors. The book is free; the bodily talk is expensive.  

而没有什么能像音乐在现场表演中那样被体现出来，有真实的身体。音乐是免费的；身体的表演则是昂贵的。这个公式很快就成为不仅是音乐家，甚至是作家的常用公式。书是免费的；身体上的谈话是昂贵的。

**Patronage** — It is my belief that audiences WANT to pay creators. Fans like to reward artists, musicians, authors and the like with the tokens of their appreciation, because it allows them to connect.  

赞助 - 我相信，观众希望向创作者付费。粉丝们喜欢用欣赏的信物来回报艺术家、音乐家、作家等，因为这能让他们建立联系。  

But they will only pay if it is very easy to do, a reasonable amount, and they feel certain the money will directly benefit the creators.  

但是，他们只有在非常容易做到、数额合理，而且他们觉得这些钱会直接惠及创作者的情况下才会付钱。  

Radiohead’s recent high-profile experiment in letting fans pay them whatever they wished for a free copy is an excellent illustration of the power of patronage. The elusive, intangible connection that flows between appreciative fans and the artist is worth something.  

Radiohead最近高调地尝试让粉丝为免费拷贝支付他们想要的任何费用，这很好地说明了赞助的力量。欣赏的粉丝和艺术家之间难以捉摸的、无形的联系是有价值的。  

In Radiohead’s case it was about $5 per download. There are many other examples of the audience paying simply because it feels good.  

在Radiohead的案例中，每次下载大约是5美元。还有许多其他的例子，观众付钱只是因为感觉好。

**Findability** — Where as the previous generative qualities reside within creative digital works, findability is an asset that occurs at a higher level in the aggregate of many works. A zero price does not help direct attention to a work, and in fact may sometimes hinder it.  

可寻性--正如前面的产生性品质存在于创造性的数字作品中一样，可寻性是一种资产，它发生在许多作品的总和的更高层次上。零价格无助于引导人们对作品的关注，事实上有时可能会阻碍它。  

But no matter what its price, a work has no value unless it is seen; unfound masterpieces are worthless.  

但是，无论其价格如何，一件作品除非被人看到，否则就没有价值；未被发现的杰作毫无价值。  

When there are millions of books, millions of songs, millions of films, millions of applications, millions of everything requesting our attention — and most of it free — being found is valuable.  

当有数以百万计的书籍、数以百万计的歌曲、数以百万计的电影、数以百万计的应用程序、数以百万计的一切要求我们注意--而且大部分是免费的--被发现是有价值的。

The giant aggregators such as Amazon and Netflix make their living in part by helping the audience find works they love. They bring out the good news of the “long tail” phenomenon, which we all know, connects niche audiences with niche productions.  

亚马逊和Netflix等巨型聚合商部分地通过帮助观众找到他们喜爱的作品而谋生。他们带来了 "长尾 "现象的好消息，我们都知道，它将小众观众与小众作品联系起来。  

But sadly, the long tail is only good news for the giant aggregators, and larger mid-level aggregators such as publishers, studios, and labels. The “long tail” is only lukewarm news to creators themselves.  

但可悲的是，长尾效应只对巨大的聚合者和较大的中级聚合者（如出版商、工作室和标签）是个好消息。对创作者本身来说，"长尾 "只是一个不温不火的消息。  

But since findability can really only happen at the systems level, creators need aggregators. This is why publishers, studios, and labels (PSL)will never disappear. They are not needed for distribution of the copies (the internet machine does that).  

但是，由于可寻性只能在系统层面发生，创作者需要聚合者。这就是为什么出版商、制片厂和标签（PSL）永远不会消失。他们不需要分发副本（互联网机器可以做到这一点）。  

Rather the PSL are needed for the distribution of the users’ attention back to the works. From an ocean of possibilities the PSL find, nurture and refine the work of creators that they believe fans will connect with.  

相反，PSL需要将用户的注意力重新分配到作品上。PSL从大量的可能性中找到、培养和完善他们认为粉丝会感兴趣的创作者的作品。  

Other intermediates such as critics and reviewers also channel attention. Fans rely on this multi-level apparatus of findability to discover the works of worth out of the zillions produced. There is money to be made (indirectly for the creatives) by finding talent.  

其他中间人，如评论家和评论员也会引导人们的注意力。粉丝们依靠这种多层次的发现机制，从数以百万计的作品中发现有价值的作品。通过寻找人才，可以赚钱（间接为创造者）。  

For many years the paper publication TV Guide made more money than all of the 3 major TV networks it “guided” combined. The magazine guided and pointed viewers to the good stuff on the tube that week. Stuff, it is worth noting, that was free to the viewers.  

多年来，纸质出版物《电视指南》赚的钱比它 "指导 "的三大电视网的总和还要多。该杂志为观众提供指导，让他们了解那一周电视上的好节目。值得注意的是，这些东西对观众来说是免费的。  

  There is little doubt that besides the mega-aggregators, in the world of the free many PDLs will make money selling findability — in addition to the other generative qualities.  

毋庸置疑的是，除了大型聚合者之外，在免费的世界里，许多PDL将通过出售可寻性来赚钱--除了其他生成性品质之外。

These eight qualities require a new skill set. Success in the free-copy world is not derived from the skills of distribution since the Great Copy Machine in the Sky takes care of that. Nor are legal skills surrounding Intellectual Property and Copyright very useful anymore.  

这八种品质需要一个新的技能组合。在自由复制的世界里，成功不是来自分销的技能，因为天空中的伟大复制机已经解决了这个问题。围绕知识产权和版权的法律技能也不再是非常有用的。  

Nor are the skills of hoarding and scarcity.  

囤积和匮乏的技能也不是。  

Rather, these new eight generatives demand an understanding of how abundance breeds a sharing mindset, how generosity is a business model, how vital it has become to cultivate and nurture qualities that can’t be replicated with a click of the mouse.  

相反，这些新的八代人要求理解丰裕是如何孕育出一种分享心态的，慷慨是如何成为一种商业模式的，培养和造就那些无法通过点击鼠标来复制的品质是多么重要。

In short, the money in this networked economy does not follow the path of the copies. Rather it follows the path of attention, and attention has its own circuits.  

简而言之，这个网络经济中的金钱并不遵循拷贝的路径。相反，它遵循的是注意力的路径，而注意力有自己的回路。

Careful readers will note one conspicuous absence so far. I have said nothing about advertising. Ads are widely regarded as the solution, almost the ONLY solution, to the paradox of the free.  

细心的读者会注意到，到目前为止有一个明显的缺失。我没有说到广告。广告被广泛认为是解决免费悖论的办法，几乎是唯一的办法。  

Most of the suggested solutions I’ve seen for overcoming the free involve some measure of advertising. I think ads are only one of the paths that attention takes, and in the long-run, they will only be part of the new ways money is made selling the free.  

我所看到的大多数克服免费的建议解决方案都涉及某种程度的广告。我认为广告只是注意力的途径之一，从长远来看，它们只会成为出售免费的新方法的一部分。

But that’s another story.  

但那是另一个故事。

Beneath the frothy layer of advertising, these eight generatives will supply the value to ubiquitous free copies, and make them worth advertising for. These generatives apply to all digital copies, but also to any kind of copy where the marginal cost of that copy approaches zero.  

在广告的泡沫层之下，这八种生成物将为无处不在的免费拷贝提供价值，并使它们值得为之做广告。这些生成物适用于所有的数字拷贝，但也适用于任何一种拷贝的边际成本接近零的情况。  

(See my essay on [Technology Wants to Be Free](https://kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2007/11/technology_want.php).) Even material industries are finding that the costs of duplication near zero, so they too will behave like digital copies. Maps just crossed that threshold. Genetics is about to. Gadgets and small appliances (like cell phones) are sliding that way.  

(见我的文章《技术想要自由》。）甚至物质产业也发现复制的成本接近零，所以它们也会表现得像数字拷贝。地图刚刚跨过了这个门槛。遗传学也将如此。小玩意和小家电（如手机）正在向这个方向滑行。  

Pharmaceuticals are already there, but they don’t want anyone to know. It costs nothing to make a pill. We pay for Authenticity and Immediacy in drugs. Someday we’ll pay for Personalization.  

药品已经在那里了，但他们不想让任何人知道。制造一个药片不需要任何成本。我们为药品的真实性和即时性买单。有一天，我们将为个性化付费。

Maintaining generatives is a lot harder than duplicating copies in a factory. There is still a lot to learn. A lot to figure out. Write to me if you do.  

维护生成器比在工厂里复制副本要难得多。仍然有很多东西需要学习。有很多东西需要弄清楚。如果你有，请写信给我。
