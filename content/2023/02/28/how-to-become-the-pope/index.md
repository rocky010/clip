Are you drifting between careers, unsure of your next move? Perhaps you should become the pope. Leader of the Holy Roman Catholic Church is a prestigious position that offers excellent perks, including international travel, job security, frequent media appearances, and elaborate hats. You can name your own hours, hire your friends for any position you’d like, and supervise a small-but-wealthy city state.  

您是否在职业之间徘徊，不确定下一步行动？也许你应该成为教皇。神圣罗马天主教会的领袖是一个享有盛誉的职位，提供极好的津贴，包括国际旅行、工作保障、经常出现在媒体上，以及精美的帽子。你可以指定自己的时间，雇佣你的朋友担任任何你喜欢的职位，并监督一个小而富有的城市国家。  

If you’re into job titles, how does “Successor of the Prince of the Apostles” grab you? That’s one of eight titles you’ll inherit, all of which are more impressive on LinkedIn than “assistant district manager.  

如果您喜欢职位头衔，“使徒王子的继任者”如何吸引您？这是您将继承的八个头衔之一，所有这些头衔在 LinkedIn 上都比“助理区域经理”更令人印象深刻。  

” If the papacy sounds like a career opportunity you’d like to explore, here’s how to land the job.  

” 如果教皇职位听起来像是您想探索的职业机会，请按照以下步骤找到这份工作。  

## **How much does the pope make?**  

教皇挣多少钱？

Let’s start with the money. According to salary comparison site Comparably.com, [the average Pope in the United States](https://www.comparably.com/salaries/salaries-for-pope) earns $46,077 per year, but this is inaccurate. The position of pope offers no salary. The idea is that you’re living as Christ lived, off the kindness of others.  

让我们从钱开始吧。根据薪酬比较网站 Comparably.com 的数据，美国教皇的平均年收入为 46,077 美元，但这是不准确的。教皇的职位没有薪水。这个想法是你像基督一样生活，没有别人的善意。  

But over a few thousand years, those “others” have been very generous—the Vatican City State and the Catholic Church are worth an estimated $30 billion, and it’s essentially at your disposal.  

但几千年来，那些“其他人”一直非常慷慨——梵蒂冈城国和天主教会估计价值 300 亿美元，基本上由你支配。  

As the absolute monarch of a small nation, you can have anything you’d ever want or need just by asking for it. So the pay is low, but benefits are good.  

作为一个小国的专制君主，你想要或需要的任何东西只要开口要求就可以得到。所以工资低，但福利好。

## **How is the pope selected?**  

教皇是怎么选出来的？

When it is time for a new pope to be chosen, the Church doesn’t post on [indeed.com](http://indeed.com/). Instead, up to 120 cardinals (bishops and Vatican officials) gather in Rome to hash out who gets the job. It’s not exactly an open process—cardinal electors take a vow of absolute secrecy before locking themselves in the Sistine Chapel to hold papal elections. Presumably, the cardinals discuss who would be the best choice to meet the needs of the church. There’s probably politicking. Alliances and voting blocs are formed, and relationships are tested. I imagine it’s like _Survivor._ Someone probably says, “I came here to be pope; I didn’t come here to make friends.”  

到了选出新教皇的时候，教会不会在 indeed.com 上发帖。取而代之的是，多达 120 名红衣主教（主教和梵蒂冈官员）聚集在罗马，讨论谁能获得这份工作。这并不是一个完全公开的过程——枢机选民在将自己锁在西斯廷教堂举行教皇选举之前发誓绝对保密。据推测，红衣主教们会讨论谁是满足教会需求的最佳人选。可能有政治活动。联盟和投票集团形成，关系受到考验。我想这就像幸存者。有人可能会说，“我来这里是为了当教皇；我不是来这里交朋友的。”

The actual election goes like this: Each cardinal writes the name of their choice on a piece of paper, and they proceed, one-by-one, to solemnly drop their vote in a chalice set before Michelangelo’s fresco of the Last Judgment. Dramatic much? Anyway, the votes are counted, and if no one receives a two-thirds majority, the votes are burned in a special furnace along with chemicals that produce black smoke. That way everyone outside the chapel knows that the cardinals are still jawing.  

实际的选举是这样的：每位红衣主教在一张纸上写下他们选择的名字，然后他们一个接一个地在米开朗基罗的《最后审判》壁画前的圣杯中庄严地投下他们的选票。戏剧性多吗？无论如何，选票都会被清点，如果没有人获得三分之二多数票，选票将与会产生黑烟的化学品一起在特制的炉子中焚烧。这样教堂外的每个人都知道红衣主教们还在喋喋不休。

There are four rounds of voting per day, and the process goes on until some lucky fellow gets the nod. If there are 34 elections and no clear winner, the cardinals can choose any method of selection they want. Back in the 1270s, Pope Gregory X decreed that the longer the conclave lasted, the less food would be given to the cardinals, but that rule was sadly rescinded. Once the (fully fed) cardinals have agreed on a person, be it by a two-thirds vote or arm wrestling tournament, _mazel tov_! You got a new pope! The ballots are burned with chemicals that produce white smoke. The newborn pope chooses his pope name, is dressed in fancy clothes, and gets paraded out to the balcony of Saint Peter’s to be introduced to his adoring fans. The senior cardinal deacon declares “Habemus Papam!  

每天有四轮投票，这个过程一直持续到有幸运的人点头为止。如果有 34 次选举并且没有明确的获胜者，红衣主教可以选择他们想要的任何选择方法。早在 1270 年代，教皇格雷戈里十世就下令秘密会议持续的时间越长，给红衣主教的食物就越少，但遗憾的是该规定被废除了。一旦（完全喂养的）红衣主教就一个人达成一致，无论是通过三分之二的投票还是比武比赛，mazel tov！你有一位新教皇！选票是用会产生白烟的化学品焚烧的。新生的教皇选择了他的教皇名字，穿着华丽的衣服，被列队带到圣彼得大教堂的阳台上，被介绍给他的崇拜者。高级枢机执事宣布“Habemus Papam！  

” which translates roughly to “This motherfucker here is the new boss!”  

”大致翻译为“这个混蛋是新老板！”

## **Getting your name on the papers**  

让你的名字出现在报纸上

To become pope, you must be a member of the Roman Catholic Church, and you must be a man (we don’t want no _women_ mucking around with our Universal Church after all). That’s really it. You don’t need a degree from community college or any specific certification or training. You can come from any background and be from any part of the world. You don’t have to be a cardinal or even a priest.  

要成为教皇，你必须是罗马天主教会的成员，而且你必须是一个男人（毕竟我们不希望任何女人与我们的普世教会混为一谈）。就是这样。您不需要社区大学的学位或任何特定的认证或培训。你可以来自任何背景，来自世界任何地方。您不必是红衣主教，甚至不必是牧师。  

All you have to do is get your name on those papers—but that’s the tricky part.  

你所要做的就是在这些文件上写上你的名字——但这是棘手的部分。

As you might expect from the upper echelon of a world religion, the job of pope tends to go to an insider. Since 1379, every pope has been selected from among the college of cardinals casting the votes. So if you _haven’t_ spent your life moving up the ranks of the Catholic Church to get into the special pope-picking room, you’re going to have to get creative.  

正如您对世界宗教高层的期望一样，教皇的职位往往由内部人士担任。自1379年以来，每位教皇都是从投票的枢机主教团中选出的。因此，如果您一生都没有在天主教会中晋升以进入特别的教皇挑选室，那么您将不得不发挥创造力。

## **Underhanded influence on cardinal electors**  

对枢机选民的不正当影响

In the modern era, new popes are chosen either when the old pope dies, or when the current pope resigns because of a [complicated internal church scandal.](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25121121) Wait, maybe it was for “health reasons.” Either way, there is generally a 15- to 20-day period between the end of the last pope’s reign and the papal conclave. This popeless-period is your best opportunity to influence the vote.  

在现代，要么在老教皇去世时选出新教皇，要么在现任教皇因复杂的教会内部丑闻辞职时选出新教皇。等等，也许是出于“健康原因”。无论哪种方式，在最后一位教皇统治结束和教皇秘密会议之间通常有 15 到 20 天的时间。这个没有教皇的时期是你影响投票的最佳机会。

John Paul II declared that the cardinals lodge in St. Martha’s House, a building next to the Sistine Chapel, during the election process, so you know exactly where the voters will be spending their off-time, praying or golfing or whatever. If you were to befriend the staff at St.  

约翰·保罗二世 (John Paul II) 宣布，在选举过程中，红衣主教们住在西斯廷教堂旁边的圣玛莎之家 (St. Martha’s House)，这样您就可以确切地知道选民们将在哪里度过他们的休息时间、祈祷或打高尔夫球等等。如果你想和圣路易斯的工作人员交朋友  

Martha’s House, maybe you could convince them to talk about you in a way the cardinals would overhear. The average salary in Vatican City is shockingly low, around $36,574 a year, so greasing some palms wouldn’t hurt. Perhaps two valets could say, “You know who would make a _great_ pope? Steve Johnson! He’s this writer from Los Angeles. Really Jesus-like,” while Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re is walking to the Holy Roman Cafeteria.  

玛莎之家，也许你可以说服他们以红衣主教会无意中听到的方式谈论你。梵蒂冈城的平均工资低得惊人，年薪约为 36,574 美元，因此在手掌上抹点油并不会造成伤害。也许两个仆人会说：“你知道谁会成为伟大的教皇吗？史蒂夫约翰逊！他是这位来自洛杉矶的作家。真的很像耶稣，”红衣主教乔瓦尼·巴蒂斯塔·雷 (Giovanni Battista Re) 正走向神圣罗马自助餐厅。

Another potential avenue is engineering a spiritual vision. Using high-tech spy gear—holograms, hidden speakers, mind-control rays—a potential dark-horse pope candidate could engineer a shared a spiritual manifestation for all the cardinals. These are, ostensibly, religious men, so they would presumably take it seriously if they were visited by a chorus of angels singing your name. And when they told the other cardinals, and they had the _same_ vision? How could they _not_ elect you? Also: Cardinals are usually old, and it’s easy to trick old people.  

另一个潜在的途径是设计一个精神愿景。使用高科技间谍装备——全息图、隐藏式扬声器、精神控制射线——潜在的黑马教皇候选人可以为所有红衣主教设计一个共享的精神表现。从表面上看，这些人是虔诚的人，所以如果一群天使唱着你的名字来拜访他们，他们大概会认真对待。当他们告诉其他红衣主教时，他们也有同样的看法？他们怎么能不选你呢？另外：红衣主教通常年纪大了，很容易欺骗老人。

## **Rousing the rabble: a path to the papacy**  

激起乌合之众：通向教皇之路

Modern papal succession is relatively stable, but this hasn’t always been the case.  

现代教皇的继承相对稳定，但情况并非总是如此。  

In 1268, the papal conclave lasted for almost three years, and it only ended when a local mob locked the cardinals up and fed them nothing but bread and water while demanding they pick up a pope or suffer great violence and death.  

1268 年，教皇秘密会议持续了将近三年，直到当地暴民将红衣主教关起来，只给他们面包和水，同时要求他们接受教皇，否则就会遭受巨大的暴力和死亡。

In the 14th century, Roman peasants again broke into the conclave to ensure that the cardinals not choose a French pope (racists). They told the cardinals, “Give us a Roman pope or your heads will be as red as your hats,” which is baller.  

在 14 世纪，罗马农民再次闯入秘密会议，以确保红衣主教不会选择法国教皇（种族主义者）。他们告诉红衣主教们，“给我们一个罗马教皇，否则你们的头就会像你们的帽子一样红”，这太棒了。  

The cardinals chose an Italian as a compromise, but Pope Urban VI immediately began castigating the cardinals and forbade them from accepting payoffs from kings and pocketing the money from the collection plate.  

红衣主教们选择了一名意大利人作为妥协，但教皇乌尔班六世立即开始严厉批评红衣主教，禁止他们接受国王的贿赂并将募捐盘中的钱据为己有。  

As you’d expect, he was was deposed (don’t mess with people’s livelihoods, right?) and another pope was elected. But Urban VI still called himself pope, so for awhile there were two popes (or a pope and an anti-pope, if you prefer). Then, in 1409, the French and Roman cardinals elected another pope to clean up the mess. Neither of the two existing popes stepped down, so there were _three_ popes. Engineering an angry mob to influence the outcome of a democratic election seems impossible in modern times (who would be _that much_ of an asshole, right?), but it could triple your chances of becoming pope.  

如你所料，他被罢免了（别惹民生，对吧？），并选出了另一位教皇。但是乌尔班六世仍然称自己为教皇，所以有一段时间有两个教皇（或者一个教皇和一个反教皇，如果你愿意的话）。然后，在1409年，法国和罗马的红衣主教推选了另一位教皇来收拾烂摊子。现有的两位教皇都没有下台，因此出现了三位教皇。设计一个愤怒的暴民来影响民主选举的结果在现代似乎是不可能的（谁会那么混蛋，对吧？），但它可以使你成为教皇的机会增加三倍。

## **Heavy is the head that wears the gigantic pope hat**  

Heavy是头戴教皇大帽的

When you become pope, you will immediately become among the most famous people in the world, but it’s a strange kind of fame.  

当你成为教皇时，你将立即跻身于世界上最著名的人物之列，但这是一种奇怪的名声。  

You get driven around in really amazing custom cars, fly around in a private jet, throngs of people come out just to hear you talk about how awesome God is, and you even command a small army of 110 soldiers. But you don’t get invited to Oscar after-parties, and you can’t parlay the papacy into all the sex you want either. At least, not out in the open. You have to at least appear “holy” to keep the gig.  

你开着非常棒的定制汽车四处走动，乘坐私人飞机四处飞行，成群结队的人出来只是为了听你谈论上帝是多么伟大，你甚至可以指挥一支由 110 名士兵组成的小军队。但是你不会被邀请参加奥斯卡晚会，你也不能利用教皇权来获得你想要的所有性爱。至少，不要公开。你必须至少表现得“圣洁”才能保住这份工作。

The modern job of pope offers neither the carefree life of a hedonistic rock star pope like John XII (955–964), who gave land to his mistress, murdered his enemies, and was killed by a man who caught him in bed with his wife.  

教皇的现代工作既不能提供像约翰十二世（955-964）这样享乐主义的摇滚明星教皇的无忧无虑的生活，约翰十二世将土地送给他的情妇，谋杀他的敌人，并被一个抓住他和妻子在床上的男人杀死.  

But you aren’t living a quiet life of spiritual contemplation and teaching either. You’re in charge of an entire city state, so there’s a lot of administration, paperwork, and tough decisions, like [cutting the pay of everyone who works for you when tourist revenue goes down](https://thehill.com/homenews/news/544676-pope-cuts-salaries-for-cardinals-clerics-to-save-other-jobs). There’s also vicious office politics. We’ll likely never know all the details—the Church is hush-hush—but the scandal around the resignation of Benedict XVI gave a glimpse of the viper’s next of cliques competing within the Church, with everything from graft around the annual nativity scene in St Peter’s Square to the dispersal of funds in the Vatican Bank used to gain influence and power. It’s like high school with vestments. So do you _really_ want the job? Is Applebee’s _that_ bad of a place to work?  

但是你也没有过着精神沉思和教导的平静生活。你负责整个城市国家，所以有很多行政、文书工作和艰难的决定，比如在旅游收入下降时削减为你工作的每个人的工资。还有恶性的办公室政治。我们可能永远不会知道所有的细节——教会是绝密的——但围绕本笃十六世辞职的丑闻让我们得以一窥毒蛇在教会内部竞争的下一个派系，从每年一度的基督诞生场景周围的贪污中，无所不包。圣彼得广场把资金分散在梵蒂冈银行用来获得影响力和权力。这就像穿着法衣的高中。那么你真的想要这份工作吗？ Applebee 是一个糟糕的工作场所吗？
