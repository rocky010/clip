When I deleted my Twitter account in September last year, provoked not by Elon Musk’s imminent takeover but by the suffocating quantity of royal coverage gushing from every media source, I was left feeling bereft, as any addict is when their drug is taken away.  

当我在去年 9 月删除我的 Twitter 帐户时，不是因为埃隆马斯克即将接管，而是因为每个媒体来源涌现出令人窒息的皇室报道，我感到很失落，就像任何瘾君子在他们的药物被拿走时一样。  

How was I supposed to react to the news now? And if I had no way of reacting to the news, what did I want from the news? Am I even interested in the news, if I have no opportunity to react to it?  

我现在应该如何应对这个消息？如果我无法对新闻做出反应，我想从新闻中得到什么？如果我没有机会对此做出反应，我是否对新闻感兴趣？  

Being in the digital public sphere without any means to react is a bit like being trapped in a shopping mall without any money.  

在数字公共领域中没有任何反应方式有点像被困在没有钱的购物中心。

The timing was especially awkward since, a fortnight later, a news event came along that cried out for a reaction: Kwasi Kwarteng’s infamous ‘mini-budget’, which threw 45 years of economic orthodoxy overboard, provoked a stand-off between the government and the Bank of England, and very nearly triggered a financial crisis.  

时机特别尴尬，因为两周后，出现了一个急需反应的新闻事件：Kwasi Kwarteng 臭名昭著的“迷你预算”将 45 年的经济正统观念抛诸脑后，引发了政府和政府之间的对峙。英格兰银行，差点引发金融危机。  

Twitter gives users thirty days to change their minds after deleting their accounts, to prevent impulsive exits (i.e. to re-ensnare recovering addicts). I was still inside my thirty days.  

Twitter 给用户三十天的时间在删除帐户后改变主意，以防止冲动退出（即重新诱捕正在康复的瘾君子）。我还在我的三十天之内。  

Stopping myself rejoining in order to react to this exceptional political event took considerable self-restraint.  

为了对这一特殊的政治事件做出反应而阻止自己重新加入需要相当大的自我克制。  

The moment I came closest to cracking wasn’t in response to the events themselves, though, but when I was tasked with managing my university department’s social media profile and came across this tweet by a prominent conservative commentator:  

不过，我最接近破解的那一刻并不是对事件本身的回应，而是当我负责管理我大学系的社交媒体资料并看到一位著名保守派评论员的这条推文时：

> The louder the squealing from the left, the more certain @KwasiKwarteng and @trussliz will be that they have got this right.  
> 
> 左边的尖叫声越大，@KwasiKwarteng 和@trussliz 就越确定他们做对了。

This is the sort of culture war logic that has become known, courtesy of the American right, as ‘owning the libs’, the primary objective of which is to enrage (‘trigger’) the opposition by fair means or foul. In other online settings, it is known simply as ‘trolling’.  

这是一种文化战争逻辑，在美国右翼的帮助下，被称为“拥有自由”，其主要目的是通过公平或不正当的手段激怒（“触发”）反对派。在其他在线设置中，它被简称为“拖钓”。  

The tweeter appeared to see the unhappy reactions of the left as the litmus test of good economic policy: Kwarteng was a good chancellor because he was a successful troll. ‘What an absurd way to judge policy!’ I wanted to respond. ‘This is idiotic!  

发推者似乎将左派的不满反应视为良好经济政策的试金石：Kwarteng 是一位优秀的总理，因为他是一个成功的巨魔。 “判断政策的方式多么荒谬！”我想回应。 ‘这太愚蠢了！  

’ Yet, of course, in feeling that impulse, I was the one being drawn back into the economy of reaction. Who’s the idiot now?  

’然而，当然，在感受到那种冲动时，我是那个被拉回到反应经济中的人。现在谁是白痴？

Our public sphere is frequently dominated by events you could call ‘reaction chains’, whereby reactions provoke reactions, which provoke further reactions, and so on. Last year’s Oscars ceremony is remembered for just such a reaction chain.  

我们的公共领域经常被可以称为“反应链”的事件所主导，反应引发反应，反应引发进一步反应，等等。去年的奥斯卡颁奖典礼就是因为这样的反应链而被人们铭记。  

When the host, the comedian Chris Rock, made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith’s shaved head, her husband, Will Smith, strode up on stage and slapped Rock in the face on live television.  

当主持人、喜剧演员克里斯·洛克 (Chris Rock) 拿贾达·萍克特·史密斯 (Jada Pinkett Smith) 的剃光头开玩笑时，她的丈夫威尔·史密斯 (Will Smith) 大步走上台，在电视直播中扇了洛克的脸。  

For several days afterwards, countless commentators, celebrities and social media users sought to distinguish themselves by their reaction to ‘the slap’.  

之后的几天里，无数评论员、名人和社交媒体用户试图通过对“耳光”的反应来区分自己。  

Inevitably, those reactions provoked further reactions, as debate turned to the merits of the positions taken, and suspicion descended on those who hadn’t yet reacted at all. Everyone waited impatiently for the Academy’s official reaction: would Smith be banned, and for how long?  

这些反应不可避免地引发了进一步的反应，因为辩论转向了所采取立场的优点，而怀疑降临到那些根本没有反应的人身上。每个人都迫不及待地等待学院的官方反应：史密斯会被禁赛吗？禁赛多长时间？  

The amount of global attention ‘slapgate’ sucked up in the weeks after the ceremony was considerable.  

在颁奖典礼后的几周内，全球关注的“slapgate”数量相当可观。

One particular detail added a layer of intrigue. As a result of the blanket television surveillance of the celebrities in the auditorium, there was footage of Will Smith’s immediate reaction to Rock’s joke, which had been laughter.  

一个特定的细节增加了一层阴谋。由于对礼堂里的名人进行了全面的电视监控，有一段录像显示威尔史密斯对洛克的笑话做出了立即的反应，那是笑声。  

This impulsive response appeared entirely at odds with the anger he displayed on stage just a few seconds later. Was he acting? Was ‘the slap’ real? Or had his wife, perhaps, demanded that he step up?  

这种冲动的反应与他几秒钟后在台上表现出的愤怒完全不符。他在演戏吗？ “耳光”是真的吗？还是他的妻子要求他挺身而出？  

Every frame of the video sequence was pored over, as if it were the Zapruder footage of the Kennedy assassination.  

视频序列的每一帧都被仔细研究，就好像它是肯尼迪遇刺的 Zapruder 镜头。

Thanks largely to the spread of smart scrollable devices in the last fifteen years, a certain concept of public participation – what is now known in the managerial vernacular as ‘engagement’ – is common to events of this sort, and to the way they are framed by the media.  

很大程度上要归功于过去 15 年智能滚动设备的普及，某种公众参与的概念——现在在管理术语中被称为“参与”——对于这类事件及其组织方式来说是很常见的被媒体。  

The individual is not conceived in the same way as in the liberal philosophical tradition – as an autonomous agent, possessed of reason and interests – or in the psychoanalytic tradition, as shaped perhaps unconsciously by past conflicts and injuries.  

个体的构思方式与自由主义哲学传统不同——作为一个自主的代理人，拥有理性和利益——或者在精神分析传统中，可能在不知不觉中被过去的冲突和伤害所塑造。  

Instead, each of us (celebrities included) becomes a junction box in a vast, complex network, receiving, processing and emitting information in a semi-automatic fashion, and in real time.  

相反，我们每个人（包括名人）都成为庞大复杂网络中的接线盒，以半自动方式实时接收、处理和发送信息。  

Information and emotions bounce between these junctions, mutating as they travel, as instantiated in the memes and jokes that spread virally via social media platforms.  

信息和情绪在这些路口之间反弹，随着它们的传播而发生变化，正如通过社交媒体平台病毒式传播的模因和笑话中所体现的那样。  

In this model, each individual reaction is one more item of information thrown back into the network, in search of counter-reactions.  

在这个模型中，每个单独的反应都是一个又一个信息项，它被抛回到网络中，以寻找反反应。

Identifying the mechanisms and patterns of human reaction was one of the founding ambitions of scientific psychology, and what first enabled it to separate itself from philosophy.  

确定人类反应的机制和模式是科学心理学的创始抱负之一，也是它首先使自己与哲学分离的原因。  

Societies that pledge to respect the rights and choices of the individual have also developed an empirical fascination with the way individuals are influenced by their environment.  

承诺尊重个人权利和选择的社会也对个人受环境影响的方式产生了浓厚的兴趣。  

Early developments in psychological experimentation by Gustav Fechner and Wilhelm Wundt in Leipzig in the late 19th century focused heavily on mental and neural responses to sensory stimuli, for instance the time that elapsed between a sensation and a conscious reflex.  

古斯塔夫·费希纳 (Gustav Fechner) 和威廉·冯特 (Wilhelm Wundt) 于 19 世纪末在莱比锡进行的早期心理学实验主要集中在心理和神经对感官刺激的反应，例如感觉和有意识反射之间经过的时间。

The behaviourist tradition that came to dominate American psychology in the 20th century, pioneered by John B. Watson after the First World War and later identified with B.F. Skinner, was established with the explicit aim of rendering human responses predictable and thereby controllable. Psychology would abandon any theory of mind in favour of data on observable behaviour.  

在 20 世纪主导美国心理学的行为主义传统由约翰·B·沃森 (John B. Watson) 在第一次世界大战后开创，后来被 B.F.斯金纳 (B.F.心理学会放弃任何心智理论，转而支持关于可观察行为的数据。  

Behaviourists imagined a wholly conditioned, programmable person whose reactions are perfectly compatible with their environment, a fantasy that prompted utopian visions (such as Skinner’s novel _Walden Two_, from 1948) as well as dystopian ones (such as Anthony Burgess’s _A Clockwork Orange_, from 1962).  

行为主义者想象一个完全受制约的、可编程的人，其反应与他们的环境完全相容，这种幻想引发了乌托邦幻想（如斯金纳 1948 年的小说《瓦尔登湖二号》）和反乌托邦幻想（如安东尼伯吉斯 1962 年的《发条橙》） ).

Elements of behaviourism became enmeshed with psychoanalysis in mid-20th\-century America via the work of the psychiatrist Adolf Meyer, whose theoretical approach dominated the profession there between the Second World War and the anti-psychoanalytic turn of the 1970s.  

通过精神病学家阿道夫·迈耶 (Adolf Meyer) 的工作，行为主义的元素在 20 世纪中叶的美国与精神分析交织在一起，在第二次世界大战和 1970 年代的反精神分析转向之间，他的理论方法主导了该行业。  

Meyer’s medicalised co-option of Freud involved observing patients in controlled environments, so that their day-to-day behaviour could be assessed. As Meyer had written in 1908, ‘our comparative measure of the various disabilities is the normal complete reaction.  

迈耶对弗洛伊德的医学化合作选择涉及在受控环境中观察患者，以便评估他们的日常行为。正如迈耶在 1908 年所写的那样，“我们对各种残疾的比较测量是正常的完全反应。  

’ A good psychiatrist was one who could distinguish ‘efficient’ from ‘inefficient’ reactions (where ‘efficiency’ meant a conventional adaptation to one’s environment, for example in the way one dresses or uses money), an assessment that could only be made in the controlled environment of the asylum or hospital.  

一位优秀的精神科医生能够区分“有效”和“低效”反应（其中“有效”意味着对环境的常规适应，例如穿着或使用金钱的方式），这种评估只能在收容所或医院的受控环境。

The behaviourist tradition has revealed a lot about how humans (and other animals) respond to different stimuli, and what might count as a ‘normal’ or ‘healthy’ reaction.  

行为主义传统揭示了很多关于人类（和其他动物）如何对不同刺激做出反应，以及什么可以算作“正常”或“健康”反应。  

But it tells us nothing about the vast amounts of time and labour that societies such as ours now invest in actively trying to generate and capture reactions of various kinds, not just in science laboratories or hospitals, but across the economy, public sphere and civil society.  

但它没有告诉我们像我们这样的社会现在投入大量时间和劳动力积极尝试产生和捕捉各种反应，不仅在科学实验室或医院，而且在整个经济、公共领域和公民社会.  

The figure of the ‘troll’ is one example of this, the agent who goes out of their way to trigger a reaction – typically an angry reaction – from their target, and laughter from their peer group.  

“巨魔”的形象就是其中一个例子，特工特意触发了目标的反应——通常是愤怒的反应——并引发了同龄人的笑声。  

But anyone who has visited a famous landmark or picturesque beach in recent years will be familiar with a phenomenon that’s no less strange: photographs meticulously staged for posting on Instagram.  

但近几年去过著名地标或风景如画的海滩的任何人都会熟悉一种同样奇怪的现象：精心布置的照片发布在 Instagram 上。  

The time and effort that goes into the production of these images (including costume, hair and make-up) is unlike anything that took place in the age of the analogue photo album, and is only explicable in terms of the feverish hunt for online reaction.  

制作这些图像（包括服装、发型和化妆）所花费的时间和精力与模拟相册时代发生的任何事情都不一样，只能通过对在线反应的狂热追寻来解释.  

The status of photography in everyday life has undergone a profound transformation as a result of this reciprocal interaction between photographer and viewer.  

由于摄影师和观众之间的这种互动，摄影在日常生活中的地位发生了深刻的转变。  

In turn, the design of public landmarks and home interiors has changed, with the aim of producing more engaging visual content.  

反过来，公共地标和家居室内设计也发生了变化，目的是产生更具吸引力的视觉内容。

Think also of the ceaseless emails that now follow online purchases, as companies demand to know about our ‘experience’ of having a parcel shoved through our letterbox. The more usual term for what is being sought here is not ‘reaction’, but ‘feedback’.  

还想一想现在在线购买后源源不断的电子邮件，因为公司要求了解我们将包裹从我们的信箱中推入的“体验”。这里寻求的更常用的术语不是“反应”，而是“反馈”。  

This term was popularised by cybernetics, an interdisciplinary field that emerged from the Second World War, and brought together psychiatrists, computer scientists and biologists in a collective effort to understand the way organisms – and potentially machines – constantly adapt to a changing environment.  

这个术语因控制论而流行，控制论是第二次世界大战后出现的一个跨学科领域，它将精神病学家、计算机科学家和生物学家聚集在一起，共同努力了解生物体——以及潜在的机器——不断适应不断变化的环境的方式。  

From the cybernetic perspective, humans – like animals and all complex systems – pursue their objectives by constantly adjusting their behaviour in response to ‘feedback’.  

从控制论的角度来看，人类——就像动物和所有复杂的系统一样——通过不断调整他们的行为以响应“反馈”来追求他们的目标。  

Reaction becomes a two-way street, as new information is constantly processed and behaviour adjusted in response.  

随着不断处理新信息并根据响应调整行为，反应变成了两条路。  

Every animate being reacts to the reactions of those around it. Among other things, this provided a whole new way of understanding and justifying markets: price signals could be understood as feedback to which traders must constantly react.  

每个有生命的生物都会对周围人的反应做出反应。除其他外，这提供了一种理解和证明市场的全新方式：价格信号可以理解为交易者必须不断做出反应的反馈。  

In societies such as ours, the possible reactions of the financial markets hover over every political move, as Truss and Kwarteng were unceremoniously reminded.  

在像我们这样的社会中，金融市场的可能反应笼罩着每一个政治行动，正如特拉斯和克瓦腾被毫不客气地提醒的那样。

The Instagrammer on holiday learns how to increase follower engagement by monitoring the reactions that their images receive; the delivery company keeps track of its logistics (and surveils its drivers) on the basis of the customer feedback it receives; the financial analyst scours their Bloomberg terminal for the all-important price movement.  

正在度假的 Instagram 用户学习如何通过监控他们的图像收到的反应来提高关注者的参与度；送货公司根据收到的客户反馈跟踪其物流（并监督其司机）；金融分析师在他们的彭博终端上搜索最重要的价格走势。  

The most important thing about feedback isn’t whether it’s positive or negative, but that you get it in the first place, and sustaining a constant feedback loop requires constant vigilance and work.  

关于反馈最重要的不是它是正面的还是负面的，而是你首先得到它，而维持一个持续的反馈循环需要不断的警惕和工作。

As an academic, I know only too well the pains that universities take to get their students to give feedback via the National Student Survey.  

作为一名学者，我非常了解大学为让学生通过全国学生调查提供反馈所付出的努力。  

Negative feedback is a worry, of course, but the real fear is that students won’t take the survey at all: if a university department fails to meet the minimum response threshold, it will disappear from the league tables.  

当然，负面反馈令人担忧，但真正令人担忧的是学生根本不会参加调查：如果一个大学部门未能达到最低回应门槛，它将从排行榜上消失。  

Similarly, the online influencer’s fear isn’t negative reactions, but that ‘engagement’ drops. In a cybernetic context, the individual or organisation that receives no feedback has ceased to change or evolve, and is to all intents and purposes dead.  

同样，网络影响者的恐惧不是负面反应，而是“参与度”下降。在控制论的背景下，没有收到反馈的个人或组织已经停止改变或进化，并且就所有意图和目的而言都是死的。

The term ‘cybernetics’ derives from the Greek _kybernetes_, the steersman of a ship. The problem that preoccupied cyberneticians was how complex systems – whether brains, organisations, swarms of insects or computer networks – are brought under control.  

“控制论”一词源自希腊语 kybernetes，意思是船的舵手。控制论学家关注的问题是如何控制复杂的系统——无论是大脑、组织、昆虫群还是计算机网络。  

Work that out, and the next question is how they might be steered towards some kind of goal.  

解决这个问题，下一个问题是如何引导他们实现某种目标。  

Feedback, for cyberneticians, is the information – from the speedometer on a dashboard, for example, or the feeling in the stomach registered by the brain as ‘hunger’ – that tells the steersman to adjust their behaviour in a particular way, the better to reach their destination.  

对于控制论者来说，反馈是信息——例如来自仪表盘上的速度计，或者大脑记录为“饥饿”的胃部感觉——告诉舵手以特定方式调整他们的行为，以便更好地到达目的地。

Yet much of the anxiety provoked by today’s reaction economy consists in the possibility that, in our desperate hunt for feedback and our need to give feedback to others, we allow ourselves to be steered in directions we did not consent to, and may not wish to go.  

然而，当今反动经济引发的大部分焦虑可能在于，在我们拼命寻求反馈并需要向他人提供反馈的过程中，我们允许自己被引导到我们不同意的方向，并且可能不希望这样做去。  

This has echoes of the mid-20th\-century fears of advertising, PR and propaganda, with the difference that now, in the age of reaction chains, we are drawn towards controversy, absurd public spectacles, endlessly mutating memes, trolling etc. In these showers of feedback, much of the appeal is in the sheer quantity of reaction being circulated.  

这与 20 世纪中叶对广告、公关和宣传的恐惧相呼应，不同之处在于现在，在反应链时代，我们被吸引到争议、荒谬的公共场面、无休止的变异模因、拖钓等。在这些反馈的阵雨，大部分的吸引力在于正在传播的反应的绝对数量。  

Feedback mechanisms, which the cyberneticians viewed as instruments to achieve autonomy and facilitate navigation, turn out to be a trap.  

反馈机制被控制论学家视为实现自主和促进导航的工具，结果却是一个陷阱。

In 2005, the former Arsenal and England footballer Ian Wright was filmed at the old Arsenal stadium at Highbury, as part of an ITV documentary about his life. The narrator talks about a schoolteacher, Sydney Pigden, who had been a father figure to Wright when he was growing up in South London. Wright believed that Mr Pigden had died.  

2005 年，前阿森纳和英格兰足球运动员伊恩赖特在海布里的旧阿森纳体育场拍摄，作为一部关于他生活的 ITV 纪录片的一部分。叙述者谈到了一位名叫悉尼皮格登的教师，在赖特在伦敦南部长大时，他一直是赖特的父亲。赖特认为皮格登先生已经死了。  

He is filmed gazing out over the pitch from the stands, when he turns round suddenly and looks as if he’s seen a ghost: Mr Pigden is standing in front of him. Wright double-takes, then removes his cap in deference. ‘Mr Pigden ... you’re alive.’  

他从看台上凝视着球场，突然转身，看起来就像看到了鬼一样：皮格登先生站在他面前。 Wright 仔细看了看，然后恭敬地摘下帽子。 “皮格登先生……你还活着。”

This clip wasn’t uploaded to YouTube until 2010, where it has since had nearly six million views.  

该剪辑直到 2010 年才上传到 YouTube，此后它的浏览量已接近 600 万。  

There is something irresistible about watching Wright’s face switch from nostalgic contentment as he gazes over his old ground, to shock and then tears as his past appears in front of him. The footage was taken from a TV documentary, but the YouTube-enabled notoriety of the clip links it to one of the most popular genres of online video content, the ‘reaction video’.  

看着赖特的脸从他凝视着他的旧土地时怀旧的满足转变为震惊，然后当他的过去出现在他面前时泪流满面，这让人无法抗拒。该片段取自一部电视纪录片，但该片段在 YouTube 上的声名狼藉将其与最流行的在线视频内容类型之一“反应视频”联系起来。  

A seminal event in the emergence of this genre took place in 2006, when a YouTube user uploaded some grainy video footage of two children, Brandon and Rachel, unwrapping a games console on Christmas Day six years earlier. ‘N Sixty Fouuuurr’, nine-year-old Brandon roars.  

2006 年发生了这一类型的开创性事件，当时一位 YouTube 用户上传了一些模糊的视频片段，内容是六年前的圣诞节，两个孩子布兰登和瑞秋打开游戏机的包装。 “N Sixty Fouuuurr”，九岁的布兰登吼道。  

‘N Sixty Fouurrrrr’. The video, entitled ‘Nintendo Sixty-FOOOOOOOOOOUR’, has had 25 million views.  

“N 六十四”。这段名为“Nintendo Sixty-FOOOOOOOOOOOUR”的视频已获得 2500 万次观看。

In the years since then, social media platforms have become awash with content that focuses on impulsive emotional responses – to an unexpected gift, a shocking piece of news, the experience of playing a video game, or listening to a famous song for the first time.  

从那以后的几年里，社交媒体平台上充斥着关注冲动情绪反应的内容——对一份意想不到的礼物、一条令人震惊的消息、玩电子游戏的经历，或者第一次听一首著名歌曲.  

YouTube features hundreds of videos of deaf children hearing for the first time thanks to new cochlear implants. Just as holidays are now choreographed for Instagram, big surprises are now carefully staged to generate video content.  

YouTube 上有数百个失聪儿童通过新的人工耳蜗首次听到声音的视频。正如现在为 Instagram 精心设计的假期一样，现在精心安排了巨大的惊喜来生成视频内容。  

A former colleague of mine with young children hadn’t seen his parents, who live overseas, for more than two years because of Covid restrictions.  

由于 Covid 的限制，我的一位有年幼孩子的前同事已经两年多没有见到他居住在海外的父母。  

When he was finally able to book a trip, he kept it a secret from them, so that he and his family could arrive unexpectedly and capture the grandparents’ reaction on his smartphone for posterity. There are costs to decisions like these.  

当他终于能够预订旅行时，他对他们保密，这样他和他的家人就可以意外到达并在他的智能手机上记录祖父母的反应以供子孙后代使用。像这样的决定是有代价的。  

The grandparents were denied the pleasure of having something to look forward to and planning things to do on the visit, not to mention having enough notice to keep their diaries free.  

祖父母无法享受在访问中有所期待和计划要做的事情的乐趣，更不用说有足够的时间让他们的日记免费了。  

But the costs were deemed worthwhile, in order that one magical moment might be captured, then later replayed, and perhaps posted online to be seen by others.  

但这些成本被认为是值得的，因为这样一个神奇的时刻就可以被捕捉下来，然后重播，也许还可以发布到网上让其他人看到。

What’s really going on here? How have we come to imbue the split-second emotional response with so much cultural and moral value, to the point where significant moments in our lives can be arranged in pursuit of it?  

这里到底发生了什么？我们如何将如此多的文化和道德价值灌输到瞬间的情绪反应中，以至于可以安排我们生活中的重要时刻来追求它？  

On a purely technological level, it is a function of the vast capacity for surveillance that now exists, thanks to the ubiquity of smartphones and other recording devices. The analogue precedent for reaction videos was _Candid Camera_, which first aired in America in 1948 and became a massive television hit in the 1950s and 1960s. _Candid Camera_ arranged to put unsuspecting people in absurd situations as they went about their everyday lives, and secretly filmed the results; the climax came when the target was dramatically told ‘You’re on _Candid Camera_,’ to much shock and hilarity. As Bradley Clissold has argued, the success of _Candid Camera_ can be understood in the context of Cold War anxieties over surveillance, providing a humorous release for the pressure of being or feeling watched that was an unsettling new affect in postwar America.  

在纯技术层面上，由于智能手机和其他记录设备的无处不在，它是现在存在的巨大监控能力的一个功能。反应视频的模拟先例是 Candid Camera，该影片于 1948 年在美国首次播出，并在 1950 年代和 60 年代成为热门电视节目。 Candid Camera 安排让毫无戒心的人在日常生活中处于荒谬的境地，并秘密拍摄结果；当目标被戏剧性地告诉“你在偷拍”时，高潮就来了，这让人们非常震惊和欢闹。正如 Bradley Clissold 所说，可以在冷战时期对监视的焦虑的背景下理解偷拍的成功，它以幽默的方式释放了被监视或感觉被监视的压力，这在战后美国是一种令人不安的新影响。

Charles Darwin’s _The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals_ (1872), seen by some as the origin of modern understandings of emotion, included extensive interpretation of emotional reactions on animals’ faces.  

查尔斯·达尔文 (Charles Darwin) 的《人与动物的情绪表达》(The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, 1872) 被一些人视为现代情绪理解的起源，其中包括对动物面部情绪反应的广泛解释。  

Darwin was an enthusiastic photographer: the recent invention of the camera enabled him to capture and study fleeting facial expressions in a way that hadn’t previously been possible.  

达尔文是一位热情的摄影师：最近发明的照相机使他能够以一种以前不可能的方式捕捉和研究稍纵即逝的面部表情。  

The quest for the ‘authentic’, unstaged reaction is accelerated by the drift towards ubiquitous videography.  

无处不在的摄像技术加速了对“真实的”、未上演的反应的追求。  

But we also have to reckon with the fact that, in a culture producing a vast over-abundance of ‘content’, snippets showing emotional impulses seem to retain a value little else can match.  

但我们也必须考虑到这样一个事实，即在一种产生大量“内容”的文化中，显示情感冲动的片段似乎保留了其他任何东西都无法比拟的价值。  

Across various genres, embodied responses to cultural artefacts carry greater worth than the artefacts themselves. The streaming platform Twitch (which currently has 140 million monthly users worldwide) enables people to watch other people playing computer games.  

在各种流派中，对文化人工制品的具体反应比人工制品本身具有更大的价值。流媒体平台 Twitch（目前在全球每月拥有 1.4 亿用户）使人们能够观看其他人玩电脑游戏。  

The gamer seeks to expand their audience, so as to win sponsorship and donations, not just by being very good at the games but by displaying an emotionally engaging persona as they play.  

游戏玩家寻求扩大他们的观众群，以赢得赞助和捐赠，这不仅仅是通过非常擅长游戏，而且还通过在玩游戏时展示一个情感上引人入胜的角色。

Aside from being an elite gamer, the successful Twitch user must be capable of sharing their sense of surprise and excitement as the game unfolds. Similarly, YouTube users will film themselves listening to often famous pop songs for the first time.  

除了成为精英游戏玩家之外，成功的 Twitch 用户还必须能够在游戏展开时分享他们的惊喜和兴奋感。同样，YouTube 用户会拍摄自己第一次聆听经常流行的流行歌曲。  

In one of the most famous examples – the video has had ten million views – twin brothers Tim and Fred Williams listen to Phil Collins’s ‘In the Air Tonight’ for the first time and express their astonishment and delight when the drum break hits four minutes in.  

最著名的例子之一是——该视频有千万次观看——双胞胎兄弟蒂姆和弗雷德威廉姆斯第一次听到菲尔柯林斯的“今晚在空中”，当鼓声响起四分钟时，他们表达了他们的惊讶和喜悦。 .  

The most successful reaction video-makers have a likeable, innocent air; they listen in a spirit of wonder, not unlike a baby hearing something for the first time.  

最成功的反应视频制作者有一种讨人喜欢的天真气质；他们以惊奇的精神聆听，就像婴儿第一次听到一样。

The allure of these videos consists at least partly in the fact that, very often, the viewers will be familiar with the song, and might find it hard to respond to it themselves. The endless replaying of classic pop songs from the second half of the 20th century makes it difficult to retain a sense of a song’s specialness or remember the way it once sounded. The music reaction video provides a tunnel back to a pre-digital era, before the ‘long tail’ of old content was so instantly and freely available.  

这些视频的吸引力至少部分在于这样一个事实，即观众通常会熟悉这首歌，并且可能会发现自己很难对它做出回应。 20 世纪下半叶的经典流行歌曲无休止地重播，让人很难保留歌曲的特殊性或记住它曾经的声音。音乐反应视频提供了一个回到前数字时代的隧道，在旧内容的“长尾”可以立即免费获得之前。  

Just as the successful Twitch streamer supplies a vicarious experience of elite-level gaming, the successful music reaction video-maker becomes a conduit for an appreciation of value that has been buried beneath a mountain of Radio Six Music and Spotify playlists.  

正如成功的 Twitch 流媒体提供精英级游戏的替代体验一样，成功的音乐反应视频制作者成为欣赏被埋在第六电台音乐和 Spotify 播放列表山下的价值的渠道。  

The music reaction video, like vinyl listening parties and ‘anniversary live tours’ of classic albums, attempts to excavate an aesthetic impact that has been smothered by the digital archive.  

音乐反应视频，如黑胶唱片聆听派对和经典专辑的“周年纪念现场巡演”，试图挖掘被数字档案扼杀的美学影响。

There’s an ambiguity here as to where the real value lies. Is the reaction testament to the value of the song (or the computer game, the Christmas present or whatever else)? Or is the artefact just an instrument used to provoke the impulsive emotional reaction?  

关于真正的价值所在，这里存在歧义。反应是否证明了歌曲（或电脑游戏、圣诞礼物或其他任何东西）的价值？或者人工制品只是用来激起冲动情绪反应的工具？  

The simultaneity of artefact and response suggests a novel synthesis of criticism with behavioural experiment.  

人工制品和反应的同时性表明批评与行为实验的新颖综合。  

Something similar goes on in the strain of contemporary cultural documentary-making in which celebrity broadcasters such as Simon Schama or Grayson Perry are filmed gazing at an artefact they admire.  

当代文化纪录片制作的压力中也有类似的事情发生，其中拍摄了 Simon Schama 或 Grayson Perry 等名人广播员凝视着他们欣赏的人工制品。  

The camera often lingers just as long on the presenter’s entranced face as on the object itself, as if the real clues to its value lie not in its form or colour, but in the facial expressions of the person viewing it.  

镜头通常在主持人出神的脸上停留的时间与在物体本身上停留的时间一样长，就好像其价值的真正线索不在于它的形式或颜色，而在于观看它的人的面部表情。  

A kind of mirroring is enacted between human face and artefact, with each put in service of revealing the other.  

人脸和人工制品之间形成了一种镜像，彼此都为揭示对方服务。

The extraordinary growth of reaction content is connected to a much larger transformation in the way we have come to view ourselves and our societies over the past thirty years or so.  

在过去三十年左右的时间里，反应内容的惊人增长与我们看待自己和社会的方式发生了更大的转变有关。  

As the sociologist Nikolas Rose has detailed, the rise and cultural influence of the neurosciences since the early 1990s has brought about subtle but profound transformations in what we consider a human being to be. The psychology and psychoanalysis that originated in the late 19th century were founded on a belief in ‘the mind’ and ‘consciousness’ (concepts that were steadily sidelined by the behaviourist revolutions that followed), but people are now encouraged to understand themselves as neural creatures, possessed of brains whose chemistry and physical make-up shape the way they feel and behave.  

正如社会学家尼古拉斯·罗斯 (Nikolas Rose) 所详述的那样，自 1990 年代初期以来，神经科学的兴起和文化影响给我们所认为的人类带来了微妙而深刻的转变。起源于 19 世纪后期的心理学和精神分析建立在对“思想”和“意识”的信念之上（这些概念在随后的行为主义革命中逐渐被边缘化），但现在鼓励人们将自己理解为神经生物，拥有大脑，其化学和物理构成塑造了他们的感觉和行为方式。

Two neuroscientific discoveries in particular have permeated our culture, even if we scarcely notice them. The first is ‘brain plasticity’: the idea that we are physiologically altered by experiences, especially those we have when young.  

有两项神经科学发现尤其渗透到我们的文化中，尽管我们几乎没有注意到它们。第一个是“大脑可塑性”：我们会因经历而在生理上发生改变，尤其是我们年轻时的经历。  

While it would be a stretch to describe videos of people listening to songs for the first time as neurological experiments, the fascination with them stems from a similar philosophical principle, that experiences are like footprints in snow, leaving a physical mark.  

虽然将人们第一次听歌的视频描述为神经学实验有点牵强，但对它们的迷恋源于一个类似的哲学原理，即体验就像雪地里的脚印，留下物理标记。  

The naive listener is imprinted by a song, which gives the viewer the chance to witness the song’s impact, unpolluted by previous experience.  

天真的听众被一首歌打上了烙印，这让观众有机会目睹这首歌的影响，没有被以前的经历所污染。

The second neuroscientific finding that has implanted itself in the culture is that of ‘mirror neurons’, which have been proposed by some as the physiological basis of empathy.  

第二个植根于文化的神经科学发现是“镜像神经元”，一些人提出它是同理心的生理基础。  

When we witness someone else apparently experiencing an intense emotion or feeling, our own neural circuits are affected in turn. Thus to see someone in acute pain provokes activity in the parts of our own brains that are associated with pain.  

当我们看到其他人显然正在经历强烈的情绪或感觉时，我们自己的神经回路也会受到影响。因此，看到某人处于剧烈疼痛中会激发我们大脑中与疼痛相关的部分的活动。  

Reaction videos could be explained in similar terms: excitement, fear, pleasure and surprise can be experienced in small, manageable doses by witnessing them on the face of the other.  

反应视频可以用类似的术语来解释：兴奋、恐惧、快乐和惊喜可以通过在对方脸上见证它们而以小的、可控制的剂量体验。

The mediation of neural empathy via touchscreen technology allows emotions and moods to travel mimetically and virally. But there is one other interface on which a great deal relies: the human face itself.  

通过触摸屏技术调解神经同理心，可以让情绪和情绪以模仿和病毒的方式传播。但是，还有一个很大程度上依赖的界面：人脸本身。  

The quest for authentic joy or shock – or best of all, joy and shock at the same time – which drives reaction content endows the human face with a communicative magic that words cannot match.  

对真正的快乐或震惊的追求——或者最好的是，快乐和震惊同时存在——驱动反应内容，赋予人脸语言无法比拟的沟通魔力。  

The changing face of Ian Wright or the baby who hears for the first time is taken as a guarantee of truth in a world of fakery and scripted dialogue.  

伊恩·赖特 (Ian Wright) 不断变化的面孔或第一次听到声音的婴儿在虚假和脚本对话的世界中被视为真实的保证。

It is an infernal riddle of digital culture that ‘authenticity’ is constantly breeding its opposite: the ‘spontaneous’ event that proves to be no such thing, the ‘surprise’ that turns out to be staged, the emotional outburst that has been practised.  

“真实性”不断滋生其对立面，这是数字文化的一个地狱之谜：事实证明并非如此的“自发”事件，最终被证明是上演的“惊喜”，已经实践过的情绪爆发。  

TikTok is awash with apparently ‘authentic’ clips of humorous reactions (often based on pranks), the comments on which are preoccupied with whether or not the interaction is ‘real’.  

TikTok 充斥着明显“真实”的幽默反应片段（通常基于恶作剧），评论中全神贯注于互动是否“真实”。  

The human face, the standard for emotional truth, is also the basis for emojis and Facebook ‘reactions’, now an entire system of signification capable of conveying considerable meaning, but one from which the promise of authentic or immediate emotion has been lost.  

人脸是情感真实的标准，也是表情符号和 Facebook“反应”的基础，现在是一个能够传达相当多意义的完整意义系统，但真实或即时情感的承诺已经丧失。  

Any culture that lavishes praise on ‘authenticity’ to the extent that ours does will be beset by worries regarding ‘fakery’.  

任何像我们这样赞扬“真实性”的文化都会被“伪造”的担忧所困扰。

This culture has generated a distinctive type of celebrity or influencer, who hovers in the ambivalent spaces between critical judgment and behavioural impulse, authenticity and studied performance. Talent shows such as _The X Factor_ and _Strictly Come Dancing_ revolve around the facial reactions of celebrity judges; figures such as Simon Cowell are specialists in the manipulation of an eyebrow or the spontaneous look of surprise.  

他的文化催生了一种独特类型的名人或影响者，他们徘徊在批判性判断与行为冲动、真实性和研究性表现之间的矛盾空间中。 《X音素》和《舞动奇迹》等选秀节目围绕名人评委的面部反应展开；像西蒙考威尔这样的人物是操纵眉毛或自发惊讶表情的专家。  

Seasoned characters such as Piers Morgan are cynically aware that what will keep them in the spotlight is the force, distinctiveness and watchability of their knee-jerk responses, which are essentially designed to ignite reaction chains.  

皮尔斯摩根等经验丰富的人物愤世嫉俗地意识到，让他们成为聚光灯下的是他们下意识反应的力量、独特性和可观看性，这些反应本质上是为了点燃反应链。

We have no term for this type of celebrity or authority, one who successfully maintains an influential public position through a capacity and willingness to react in spectacular ways.  

对于这种名人或权威，我们没有任何术语，他们通过以引人注目的方式做出反应的能力和意愿成功地保持了有影响力的公众地位。  

The public reactor is in part a descendant of the Greek chorus, which would share the stage with the actors in a play, responding to events as they unfolded.  

公共反应堆在某种程度上是希腊合唱团的后代，它会与戏剧中的演员共享舞台，在事件展开时对其做出反应。  

An exaggerated capacity to react has been a significant factor in the fortunes of many unlikely political leaders in recent years. Donald Trump’s affective state is one of seeming constantly on the edge of losing his temper.  

夸大的反应能力是近年来许多不太可能的政治领导人命运的重要因素。唐纳德·特朗普的情感状态似乎总是处于发脾气的边缘。  

He appears braced for an angry encounter at any moment, something that has added a sense of danger and excitement to his political career. Boris Johnson, by contrast, always appears to be on the verge of bursting out laughing.  

他似乎随时准备迎接一场愤怒的遭遇，这给他的政治生涯增添了一种危险感和兴奋感。相比之下，鲍里斯·约翰逊似乎总是要大笑起来。  

As many observers have noted, both men had ample time to practise their ‘authentic’ personae, on reality TV shows, panel shows and elsewhere. The question of what these men are _really_ like seems somehow unanswerable.  

正如许多观察家所指出的那样，两人都有充足的时间在真人秀、面板节目和其他地方练习他们的“真实”角色。这些人到底是什么样子的问题似乎无法回答。

Those with a pronounced and visible capacity to be publicly enraged or publicly amused (it is Nigel Farage’s distinction to appear forever angry and amused at the same time) have been central to politics in the last decade, and to the ‘populist’ upheavals that have afflicted liberal democracies.  

在过去的十年中，那些具有明显和明显的公开激怒或公开逗乐能力的人（奈杰尔法拉奇的特点是永远同时表现出愤怒和逗乐）一直是政治的核心，也是“民粹主义”动荡的核心饱受折磨的自由民主国家。  

The continually enraged or amused political leader appears to serve as a representative, or emotional prosthesis, for those whose hostility to contemporary politics otherwise has no outlet.  

对于那些对当代政治充满敌意的人来说，这位不断激怒或被逗乐的政治领袖似乎充当了代表或情感假肢。  

Rage and laughter have also acquired important political and critical functions in this digital public sphere, where they animate the denunciation of political and economic systems in a context where the formal or ‘mainstream’ mechanisms of evaluation and judgment have come to seem rotten.  

在这个数字公共领域，愤怒和欢笑也获得了重要的政治和批评功能，在正式或“主流”的评估和判断机制似乎已经腐烂的背景下，它们激发了对政治和经济制度的谴责。  

Political rage often expresses a refusal to accept an entire regime of fairness: in the case of Trump and his followers, a regime that treats people equally regardless of skin colour and that opens a space for a confrontation with the injustices and violence of the past.  

政治愤怒通常表示拒绝接受整个公平制度：在特朗普及其追随者的案例中，这种制度无论肤色如何都一视同仁，并为对抗过去的不公正和暴力开辟了空间。  

Political laughter, on the other hand, is a way of devaluing value systems, trivialising them and exposing their putative absurdities. In conditions of political polarisation, both sides use satire and mockery to deflate the sincerity and righteousness of their opponents.  

另一方面，政治笑声是贬低价值体系、轻视它们并揭露它们假定的荒谬之处的一种方式。在政治两极分化的情况下，双方都用讽刺和嘲讽来削弱对手的诚意和正义。  

The message of political laughter is that the wrong things are being taken seriously.  

政治笑声的信息是错误的事情正在被认真对待。

Anger and humour are parallel reactions to a world that appears to have lost the capacity to recognise genuine injustice, and has become fixated instead on phoney injustices – a world that is ostensibly diverted by petty offences at the expense of real harms.  

愤怒和幽默是对一个世界的平行反应，这个世界似乎已经失去了识别真正不公正的能力，而是专注于虚假的不公正——这个世界表面上被轻微的冒犯所转移，却以真正的伤害为代价。  

Yet while anger and humour collide publicly in the pranks and interventions of trolls, they can also reveal the deeply held conviction that justice and injustice have become confused, or even inverted.  

然而，尽管愤怒和幽默在喷子的恶作剧和干预中公开碰撞，但它们也可以揭示人们根深蒂固的信念，即正义与非正义已经变得混淆，甚至颠倒过来。  

What is held up as ‘real’ is actually fake, and what is dismissed as ‘fake’ is actually real.  

被认为是“真实”的实际上是假的，而被驳回为“假”的实际上是真实的。

We may not have a precise term for the celebrity reactor, but the lexicon of political ideologies does contain one entry that speaks to my concerns: _reactionary_. Dating back to the French Revolution, the term has been used to describe those on the right who go beyond the pragmatic, gradualist claims of conservatism in order to reject an entire social order in the name of a lost past.  

我们可能没有名人反应堆的确切术语，但政治意识形态词典中确实包含一个词条表达了我的担忧：反动。追溯到法国大革命，这个词被用来描述那些超越保守主义实用主义、渐进主义主张的右翼人士，以失去的过去的名义拒绝整个社会秩序。  

Where the conservative seeks to temper the ambitions of the progressive and to highlight contingent sources of social solidarity (such as religious community or cultural identity), the reactionary seeks a more wholesale reckoning with modernity, angrily stripping away its delusions and falsehoods.  

在保守派试图缓和进步派的雄心并强调社会团结的偶然来源（例如宗教社区或文化认同）的地方，反动派则寻求对现代性进行更全面的清算，愤怒地剥离其错觉和谎言。  

For the true reactionary, the establishment (as cherished by conservatives) is too weak, too complacent, to resist the threat of progressives and revolutionaries.  

对于真正的反动派来说，当权派（正如保守派所珍视的那样）太软弱、太自满，无法抵抗进步派和革命派的威胁。  

A more aggressive right-wing agenda is needed, which would reverse not only the gains of the left, but the long decline of the establishment that opened the door to the left in the first place. For the reactionary, the ordinary conservative has been asleep at the wheel.  

需要一个更具侵略性的右翼议程，这不仅会扭转左翼的成果，而且会扭转最初向左翼敞开大门的建制派的长期衰落。对于反动派，普通的保守派已经睡着了。

Such a politics is only stirred into being thanks to the energies and actions of the left. Indeed, the reactionary shares with the revolutionary a sense of how much is at stake.  

由于左派的能量和行动，这种政治才得以形成。事实上，反动派与革命派一样都意识到事关重大。  

There is a vitalism at work – perhaps even a proto-cybernetic imaginary – in which the energies and methods of the left are channelled into the right in the form of rage, revitalising something left dormant during long periods of stability.  

有一种活力主义在起作用——甚至可能是一种原始的控制论想象——左派的能量和方法以愤怒的形式被引导到右派，使在长期稳定期间处于休眠状态的东西重新焕发活力。  

The trajectory is towards fascism, which has historically tended to originate in anti-communism. Part of political reaction is the psychological allure of heroic defeat, in which all the momentum and power is attributed to one’s opponents, yet one somehow clings on, still alive.  

轨迹是走向法西斯主义，这在历史上往往起源于反共产主义。政治反应的一部分是英勇失败的心理诱惑，其中所有的势头和力量都归功于一个人的对手，但一个人不知何故坚持，仍然活着。  

Today, the reactionary right (think of Suella Braverman) thrives on the fantasy that we have suffered long decades of cultural victories for Marxists, Blairites, wokeism, feminism and critical race studies, forces which have controlled the government, multilateral institutions and above all universities, and that the active resistance has been reduced to a small band of guerrilla fighters, holed up in embattled newspapers and opaquely funded think tanks.  

今天，反动右翼（想想苏埃拉·布雷弗曼）在幻想中茁壮成长，即我们已经为马克思主义者、布莱尔派、唤醒主义、女权主义和批判种族研究、控制政府、多边机构和最重要的大学的力量带来了数十年的文化胜利，并且积极的抵抗已经减少到一小群游击队员，躲在四面楚歌的报纸和不透明资助的智囊团中。

What are we to make of a society that invests so much in reactions of one sort or another?  

我们如何看待一个对各种反应投入如此之多的社会？  

Part of the allure of the celebrity reactor or the reaction video derives from a wish that our impulsive reactions should be the ‘right’ ones – that we might avoid the regret of l’esprit de l’escalier.  

名人反应堆或反应视频的部分吸引力源于这样一种愿望，即我们的冲动反应应该是“正确的”反应——这样我们就可以避免 l’esprit de l’escalier 的遗憾。  

One of the difficulties with anger and humour as modes of denunciation is that these impulses don’t always seize us precisely when we’d like them to, or in response to the right thing.  

将愤怒和幽默作为谴责方式的困难之一是，这些冲动并不总是在我们希望的时候准确地抓住我们，或者对正确的事情做出反应。  

Will Smith seems to wish he could be someone who reacts angrily, rather than humorously, when his wife is the object of a cruel joke.  

当他的妻子成为残酷笑话的对象时，威尔史密斯似乎希望他能成为一个愤怒而不是幽默地做出反应的人。  

(It’s odd, when one thinks about it, that we speak of people having a ‘good sense of humour’, but not a ‘good sense of anger’, despite the huge charisma we attribute to those who display such a thing.)  

（奇怪的是，当人们想到这一点时，我们说的是具有“良好幽默感”的人，而不是“良好的愤怒感”，尽管我们认为表现出这种幽默感的人具有巨大的魅力。）

The cult of reaction is perhaps a symptom of what the Frankfurt School psychoanalyst Erich Fromm described as the ‘fear of freedom’, which he believed was innate in human psychology. As Fromm wrote in his 1941 _Fear of Freedom_:  

反动崇拜或许是法兰克福学派精神分析学家埃里希·弗洛姆 (Erich Fromm) 所说的“对自由的恐惧”的症状，他认为这是人类心理中与生俱来的。正如弗洛姆在他 1941 年对自由的恐惧中所写：

> From the beginning of his existence man is confronted with the choice between different courses of action.  
> 
> 从他存在的一开始，人就面临着在不同的行动方针之间做出选择。  
> 
> In the animal there is an uninterrupted chain of reactions starting with a stimulus, like hunger, and ending with a more or less strictly determined course of action, which does away with the tension created by the stimulus. In man that chain is interrupted.  
> 
> 在动物身上有一个不间断的反应链，从刺激开始，比如饥饿，以或多或少严格确定的行动过程结束，这消除了刺激产生的紧张。在人身上，链条被打断了。  
> 
> The stimulus is there but the kind of satisfaction is ‘open’ ... It dawns upon him that his is a tragic fate: to be part of nature, and yet to transcend it.  
> 
> 刺激是存在的，但那种满足感是“开放的”……他突然意识到自己的命运是悲惨的：成为自然的一部分，却又要超越自然。

What provoked Fromm’s analysis was the authoritarianism from which he, as a German Jew, had fled. Submission to a leader and submergence within a crowd were means of escaping the anxiety and loneliness that freedom bestows on all of us.  

引发弗洛姆分析的是他作为德国犹太人逃离的威权主义。服从领导者和淹没在人群中是逃避自由赋予我们所有人的焦虑和孤独的手段。  

‘The person who gives up his individual self and becomes an automaton,’ Fromm wrote, ‘need not feel alone and anxious any more.’  

弗洛姆写道：“放弃个人自我成为机器人的人，将不再感到孤独和焦虑。”

Pessimism is understandable coming from an exile writing during the Second World War, but that’s a far remove from the world of Twitch gamers or music reaction videos.  

来自第二次世界大战期间流亡作家的悲观主义是可以理解的，但这与 Twitch 游戏玩家或音乐反应视频的世界相去甚远。  

Even so, the behaviourist turn and our crude embrace of a neuroscientific imaginary clearly signals an attempt to displace a modern idea of human ‘freedom’ with a naturalistic idea of impulse, that is, to insert human society back into the animal world, where feelings of responsibility, anxiety and guilt are absent.  

即便如此，行为主义者的转变和我们对神经科学想象的粗暴拥抱清楚地表明了一种企图用自然主义的冲动观念取代现代的人类“自由”观念，也就是说，将人类社会重新插入动物世界，在动物世界中，感觉没有责任感、焦虑和内疚。  

Reactionary political rhetoric has more obvious resonances with the phenomena that concerned Fromm: reactionaries’ explicit purpose is to restructure society around ‘natural’ hierarchies of race and gender, and to dehumanise those who, for example, exercise the perilous freedom to cross the English Channel in a small boat.  

反动的政治言论与弗洛姆所关注的现象有更明显的共鸣：反动的明确目的是围绕种族和性别的“自然”等级制度重建社会，并使那些行使危险的自由穿越英吉利海峡的人失去人性在一条小船上。

The political threat lurking here is that certain individuals purport to transcend automatic behavioural chains by sheer force of will. Conservative ideology since the 19th century has also found a place for certain individuals – entrepreneurs, leaders, executives, romantic artists – who have the strength to remain autonomous in a society based on obedience and conformity.  

潜伏在这里的政治威胁是某些人声称仅凭意志力就可以超越自动行为链。 19 世纪以来的保守意识形态也为某些个人——企业家、领导者、高管、浪漫主义艺术家——找到了一席之地，他们有能力在一个基于服从和顺从的社会中保持自主。  

Today, a variety of online political influencers, who bring together elements of the business guru, stand-up comedian and professional provocateur, position themselves as originators or leaders to be followed.  

如今，汇集商业大师、脱口秀喜剧演员和职业挑衅者元素的各种网络政治影响者将自己定位为要追随的发起人或领导者。  

The success of Jordan Peterson or Andrew Tate consists in the paradox of instructing men to be less obedient, and here’s how.  

乔丹·彼得森或安德鲁·泰特的成功在于教导男人不要那么听话的悖论，方法如下。

The idea here is that while everyone (animals included) is capable of reaction, only a rarefied minority is capable of genuine _action_. Action, from this perspective, means leadership, which in turn implies a far larger quantity of followership. Combating this mentality requires us to think of action democratically, as something made possible by the fact of human plurality.  

这里的想法是，虽然每个人（包括动物）都有反应能力，但只有少数人能够真正采取行动。从这个角度来看，行动意味着领导，而领导又意味着更多的追随者。与这种心态作斗争需要我们民主地思考行动，因为人类多元化的事实使之成为可能。  

Thus all action is in fact interaction. This is broadly what Hannah Arendt was getting at in _The Human Condition_ (1958), where she defines action as a form of initiation, a giving birth to something, a revealing of oneself to others.  

因此，所有行动实际上都是互动。这就是汉娜·阿伦特 (Hannah Arendt) 在《人类状况》(The Human Condition, 1958) 中的大致意思，她在其中将行动定义为一种启蒙形式、某种事物的诞生、向他人展示自己。

In Arendt’s view, action in the political arena differs from mere social or economic behaviour in being impervious to statistical or probabilistic analysis: ‘The fact that man is capable of action means that the unexpected can be expected from him, that he is able to perform what is infinitely improbable.  

在阿伦特看来，政治领域的行动不同于单纯的社会或经济行为，因为它不受统计或概率分析影响：什么是无限不可能的。  

’ This has an air of wartime existentialism, in which ‘action’ might involve heroic resistance to tyranny and brutality, but Arendt’s intention is to locate this disruptive, world-making kind of freedom squarely in the public sphere, such that day-to-day political participation might become imbued with these forms of responsibility.  

这有一种战时存在主义的气息，其中“行动”可能涉及对暴政和残暴的英勇抵抗，但阿伦特的意图是将这种破坏性的、创造世界的自由直接定位在公共领域，这样日常白天的政治参与可能会充满这些形式的责任。  

The challenge of democracy is to ensure that action remains rooted in the egalitarianism of a diverse public sphere, rather than lapsing into cult behaviour, reaction or obedience (whether to the diktats of the leader or the ‘laws’ of economics).  

民主的挑战是确保行动仍然植根于多元化公共领域的平等主义，而不是陷入邪教行为、反应或服从（无论是对领导人的命令还是对经济“规律”的服从）。  

For Arendt, this required that the unpredictable, incalculable qualities of politics – as distinct from economics or psychology – be kept in view at all times.  

对阿伦特来说，这要求始终关注政治的不可预测、不可估量的品质——与经济学或心理学不同——。

Action implies freedom and it implies uncertainty, neither of which is always easy to live with. Fromm, uncharacteristically for an associate of the Frankfurt School, did offer one note of optimism in his analysis.  

行动意味着自由，也意味着不确定性，两者都不容易忍受。作为法兰克福学派的一员，弗洛姆一反常态，在他的分析中确实表现出了乐观的态度。  

Individuals could become comfortable with freedom, while avoiding the anxiety and loneliness it often entails, by cultivating their capacity for what he called ‘spontaneity’, something he believed was missing from much of the adult population in the West in the 1930s and 1940s.  

通过培养他所谓的“自发性”的能力，个人可以适应自由，同时避免它经常带来的焦虑和孤独，他认为这是 1930 年代和 40 年代西方许多成年人所缺乏的。  

Spontaneous activity isn’t ‘compulsive’ activity, he noted, but an exercise of one’s whole self, both body and mind. This, he believed, had been largely eroded from Western societies by the demands of corporate capitalism in the 20th century, but it remained something children and artists were capable of, and which we all experience in snatches from time to time.  

他指出，自发活动不是“强迫性”活动，而是对一个人的身心进行全面锻炼。他认为，由于 20 世纪企业资本主义的要求，这在很大程度上已从西方社会中消失，但它仍然是儿童和艺术家能够做到的，而且我们都时不时地体验到这一点。  

Echoing Freud, Fromm suggested that it is in work and in love that humans encounter their own spontaneity, and where they rediscover a unity between mind, body and world.  

弗洛姆呼应弗洛伊德，认为正是在工作和爱情中，人类遇到了自己的自发性，并在其中重新发现了思想、身体和世界之间的统一。

Fromm was writing in the mid-20th century, a time when social criticism was preoccupied by the conformity of ‘mass society’ and ‘organisation man’. Today, post-1960s, we pride ourselves on being ‘spontaneous’ and ‘creative’.  

弗洛姆写作的时间是 20 世纪中叶，当时社会批评全神贯注于“大众社会”和“组织人”的整合。今天，20 世纪 60 年代后，我们以“自发的”和“创造性的”为荣。  

But we have turned spontaneity into something carefully staged, mass-produced and gawped at. Spontaneity that is too alert to reactions – too motivated by the quest for engagement – isn’t spontaneity at all, but a strategic ‘authenticity’, with the power dynamics of the prank.  

但我们已经把自发性变成了精心安排、大量生产和目瞪口呆的东西。过于警惕反应的自发性——过于被参与的追求所激发——根本不是自发性，而是一种战略性的“真实性”，具有恶作剧的动力。  

Political leaders whose charisma lies in seeming oblivious to the consequences of their own actions remind the rest of us that we are haunted by the potential reactions and feedback to our own actions.  

魅力在于似乎对自己行为的后果视而不见的政治领导人提醒我们其他人，我们被对我们自己行为的潜在反应和反馈所困扰。

Fromm was concerned by the way mid-20th\-century educational norms sought to eradicate the ‘spontaneity’ of the child in favour of discipline. Emotional responses were trained out of the child altogether.  

弗洛姆对 20 世纪中叶的教育规范试图根除孩子的“自发性”以支持纪律的方式感到担忧。孩子的情绪反应完全被训练出来了。  

Today, with so much talk of mental health and ‘wellbeing’, we may believe we’ve moved on from this, while at the same time being mystified as to the reason our society generates such vast anxiety among young people.  

今天，随着关于心理健康和“幸福”的讨论如此之多，我们可能会认为我们已经摆脱了这一点，但同时对我们的社会在年轻人中产生如此巨大焦虑的原因感到困惑。  

Children today may not submit to Victorian moral authorities (though the behavioural agenda in many English schools may suggest otherwise), but they are undoubtedly cowed by the authority of reactions.  

今天的孩子可能不会服从维多利亚时代的道德权威（尽管许多英国学校的行为议程可能另有建议），但他们无疑被反应的权威所吓倒。  

We can blame Instagram, WhatsApp and the possibilities for cyber-bullying afforded by life online, but we should also consider the ways technologies of feedback and reward have become embedded in every moment of a child’s schoolday, thanks especially to the widespread implementation of EdTech.[\*](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v45/n05/william-davies/the-reaction-economy#) Spontaneity and action become impossible when they are already overtaken by the range of possible reactions that might ensue, not just from teachers but from the numerous systems that track a child – or an adult for that matter – throughout the day.  

我们可以责怪 Instagram、WhatsApp 和网络生活带来的网络欺凌的可能性，但我们也应该考虑反馈和奖励技术如何融入孩子上学的每一刻，这尤其要归功于 EdTech 的广泛实施。 \* 当他们已经被可能发生的反应范围所超越时，自发性和行动就变得不可能，不仅来自老师，而且来自全天跟踪儿童或成人的众多系统。

Arendt wrote that since political action is a form of radical initiation, of starting again, it is fraught with danger. It can turn out badly. It can disrupt existing routines.  

阿伦特写道，由于政治行动是一种激进的发起、重新开始的形式，因此它充满了危险。结果可能很糟糕。它可以破坏现有的例程。  

We turn away from politics (and towards authoritarianism or, as Arendt also noted, unworldly stoicism) because there is something intimidating about the sheer novelty of which politics is capable. To overcome this obstacle, two things are required.  

我们远离政治（并转向威权主义，或者，正如阿伦特所指出的，超凡脱俗的禁欲主义），因为政治能够带来的纯粹新颖性令人生畏。要克服这个障碍，需要做两件事。  

First, people must be capable of making and keeping promises to one another, such that there isn’t a constant threat that everything will start all over again.  

首先，人们必须能够相互做出并信守承诺，这样就不会存在一切都将重新开始的持续威胁。  

If organisations and associations are to be sustained over time, the power of political action must be held in check by past commitments. Second, if we are to escape the shadow of the past and genuinely start anew, forgiveness must be possible.  

如果组织和协会要长期维持下去，政治行动的力量就必须受到过去承诺的制约。其次，如果我们要摆脱过去的阴影并真正重新开始，宽恕就必须是可能的。  

Forgiveness, for Arendt, holds a very important role in enabling us to break free of perpetual reaction and counter-reaction.  

对于阿伦特来说，宽恕在使我们摆脱永久的反应和反反应方面发挥着非常重要的作用。

> In contrast to revenge, which is the natural, automatic reaction to transgression and which because of the irreversibility of the action process can be expected and even calculated, the act of forgiving can never be predicted; it is the only reaction that acts in an unexpected way and thus retains, though being a reaction, something of the original character of action.
