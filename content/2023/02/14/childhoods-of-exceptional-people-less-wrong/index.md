Let’s start with one of those insights that are as obvious as they are easy to forget: if you want to master something, you should study the highest achievements of your field. If you want to learn writing, read great writers, etc.  

让我们从其中一个显而易见却又容易被遗忘的观点开始：如果你想掌握某样东西，你应该学习你所在领域的最高成就。如果你想学习写作，阅读伟大作家的作品，等等。

But this is not what parents usually do when they think about how to educate their kids. The default for a parent is rather to imitate their peers and outsource the big decisions to bureaucracies. But what would we learn if we studied the highest achievements?   

但这并不是父母在考虑如何教育孩子时通常会做的事情。父母的默认做法是模仿同龄人，将重大决策外包给官僚机构。但如果我们研究最高成就，我们会学到什么呢？

Thinking about this question, I wrote down a list of twenty names—von Neumann, Tolstoy, Curie, Pascal, etc—selected on the highly scientific criteria “a random Swedish person can recall their name and think, _Sounds like a genius to me”_. That list is to me a good first approximation of what an exceptional result in the field of child-rearing looks like. I ordered a few piles of biographies, read, and took notes.  

考虑到这个问题，我写下了20个名字--冯·诺依曼、托尔斯泰、居里、帕斯卡等--这些名字是根据高度科学的标准选出的，"一个随机的瑞典人能回忆起他们的名字，并认为，在我看来，他们是天才"。在我看来，这份清单是对育儿领域的杰出成果的第一个很好的近似。我订了几摞传记，读了读，做了笔记。  

Trying to be a little less biased in my sample, I asked myself if I could recall anyone exceptional that did not fit the patterns I saw in the biographies, which I could, and so I ordered a few more biographies.  

为了在我的样本中减少一点偏见，我问自己，我能不能回忆起任何不符合我在传记中看到的模式的例外，我能，所以我又订购了几本传记。

This kept going for an unhealthy amount of time.  

这种情况持续了很长时间。

I sampled writers (Virginia Woolf, Lev Tolstoy), mathematicians (John von Neumann, Blaise Pascal, Alan Turing), philosophers (Bertrand Russell, René Descartes), and composers (Mozart, Bach), trying to get a diverse sample.   

我对作家（弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫、列夫·托尔斯泰）、数学家（约翰·冯·诺依曼、布莱斯·帕斯卡、艾伦·图灵）、哲学家（伯特兰·罗素、勒内·笛卡尔）和作曲家（莫扎特、巴赫）进行了抽样调查，试图获得一个多样化的样本。

In this essay, I am going to detail a few of the patterns that have struck me after having skimmed 42 biographies. I will sort the claims so that I start with more universal patterns and end with patterns that are less common.  

在这篇文章中，我将详细介绍在浏览了42本传记之后给我留下深刻印象的一些模式。我将对这些主张进行排序，以便从更普遍的模式开始，以不太常见的模式结束。

## **Exceptional people grow up in exceptional milieus  

特殊的人在特殊的环境中成长**

_This seems to be true for >95 percent of the people I looked at.  

在我调查的人中，95%以上的人似乎是这样。_

These naked apes, the humans, are intensely social animals. They obsessively internalize values, ideas, skills, and desires from the people who surround them.  

这些裸猿，人类，是高度社会化的动物。他们强迫性地将周围人的价值观、想法、技能和欲望内化。  

It is therefore not surprising that those who grow up to be exceptional tend to have spent their formative years surrounded by adults who were exceptional.  

因此，那些成长为杰出人物的人往往在成长过程中被杰出的成年人所包围，这并不奇怪。

Virginia Woolf never attended school. Her father, Leslie Stephen, who, along with their tutors, educated Virginia and her sister, was an editor, critic, and biographer “complicatedly hated” by his daughter and of such standing that he could invite [Henry James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_James), [Thomas Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy), and [Alfred Lord Tennyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Lord_Tennyson) to dine and converse with his children. Leslie Stephen described his circle, in which Virginia grew up, as “most of the literary people of mark . . . clever young writers and barristers, chiefly of the radical persuasion . . .  

弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫从未上过学。她的父亲莱斯利·斯蒂芬（Leslie Stephen）和他们的导师沿着教育了弗吉尼亚和她的妹妹，他是一位编辑、评论家和传记作家，被女儿“复杂地憎恨”，他的地位如此之高，以至于他可以邀请亨利·詹姆斯、托马斯·哈代和阿尔弗雷德·丁尼生勋爵与他的孩子们共进晚餐并匡威。莱斯利·斯蒂芬将他的圈子，弗吉尼亚成长的圈子，描述为“马克的大多数文学人。。。聪明的年轻作家和律师，主要是激进派。。。  

we used to meet on Wednesday and Sunday evenings, to smoke and drink and discuss the universe and the reform movement.  

我们过去常常在星期三和星期天晚上见面，抽烟喝酒，讨论宇宙和改革运动。  

” When they went to the Hebrides in the summers, Leslie brought along painters and philosophers, who would hang out and work in their summer house while the children played.  

“当他们夏天去赫布里底群岛时，莱斯利沿着画家和哲学家，他们会在孩子们玩耍的时候在他们的避暑别墅里闲逛和工作。

This parental obsession with curating a rich intellectual milieu comes through in nearly all of the biographies. As I wrote in [First we shape our social graph; then it shapes us](https://escapingflatland.substack.com/p/first-we-shape-our-social-graph-then):  

这种父母对策划丰富的知识环境的痴迷几乎贯穿在所有的传记中。正如我在《第一》中所写，我们塑造了自己的社交图谱;然后它塑造了我们

> Michel Montaigne’s father employed only servants who were fluent in Latin, curating a classical culture, so Montaigne would learn Latin as his mother tongue. J.S.  
> 
> 米歇尔·蒙田的父亲只雇用精通拉丁语的仆人，管理古典文化，所以蒙田将拉丁语作为母语学习。J·S·  
> 
> Mill spent his childhood at his father’s desk, helping his father write a treatise on economics, running over to Jeremy Bentham’s house to borrow books and discuss ideas.  
> 
> 穆勒的童年是在父亲的书桌前度过的，他帮助父亲写经济学论文，跑去杰里米·边沁家借书和讨论想法。
> 
> Blaise Pascal, too, was homeschooled by his father. His father chose not to teach him math. (The father, Etienne, had a passion for mathematics that he felt was slightly unhealthy.  
> 
> 布莱斯·帕斯卡也是在父亲的家庭教育下长大的。他的父亲选择不教他数学。（父亲，艾蒂安，有热情的数学，他觉得是稍微不健康。  
> 
> He feared mathematics would distract Pascal from less intrinsically rewarding pursuits, such as literature, much like modern parents fear TikTok.) Pascal had to teach himself.  
> 
> 他担心数学会分散帕斯卡的注意力，使他无法专注于文学等回报较少的追求，就像现代父母担心TikTok一样。）帕斯卡必须自学。  
> 
> When it was discovered that Pascal, then a young teenager, had rederived several of Euclid’s proofs, the family relocated to Paris so father and son could participate in the mathematical salons of Mersenne. _The instinct was to curate a culture, not to teach, not primarily._  
> 
> 当发现帕斯卡（当时还是个十几岁的孩子）重新推导了欧几里得的几个证明时，全家搬到了巴黎，这样父子俩就可以参加梅森的数学沙龙，本能是要培养一种文化，而不是教书，也不是主要的。

At least two-thirds of my sample was home-educated (most commonly until about age 12), tutored by parents or governesses and tutors. The rest of my sample had been educated in schools (most commonly Jesuit schools).   

我的样本中至少有三分之二的人是在家接受教育的（最常见的是在12岁之前），由父母或家庭教师和家庭教师辅导。我的样本中的其他人都在学校接受过教育（最常见的是耶稣会学校）。

As children, they were integrated with exceptional adults—and were taken seriously by them.  

作为孩子，他们与特殊的成年人融合在一起，并被他们认真对待。  

When Bertrand Russell, at five years old, refused to believe the earth was round, his grandparents didn’t laugh him off—they called in the vicar of the parish to reason Bertrand out of his misconception.  

伯特兰·罗素五岁时拒绝相信地球是圆的，他的祖父母并没有一笑置之--他们请来教区的牧师，劝伯特兰打消他的误解。

The adults had high expectations of the children; they assumed they had the capacity to understand complex topics, and therefore invited them into serious conversations and meaningful work, believing them capable of growing competent rapidly.  

成年人对孩子的期望很高;他们认为他们有能力理解复杂的话题，因此邀请他们进行严肃的谈话和有意义的工作，相信他们能够迅速提高能力。

John von Neumann (the Hungarian physicist who at one time managed the development of the hydrogen bomb _and_ the first digital computer, and as a pastime, at night, invented game theory) was included in the discussions of the management of his father’s bank before reaching school age.  

约翰·冯·诺依曼（John von Neumann，匈牙利物理学家，曾负责氢弹和第一台数字计算机的研制，晚上还发明了博弈论作为消遣）在他还没到上学年龄时就参与了有关他父亲银行管理的讨论。

[From the notes of John’s younger brother Nicholas](https://www.math.ru.nl/~mueger/vonneumann.pdf):  

从笔记约翰的弟弟尼古拉斯：

> From the business visitors, at relatively formal dinners, and from father’s approach to them in the context of the activities of his banking house, we got introduced to the secrets of making business contacts and of management with executive powers in father’s banking house.  
> 
> 从商务访问者、相对正式的晚宴，以及父亲在他的银行活动中对他们的态度，我们了解到了在父亲的银行进行商务接触和管理的秘密。  
> 
> This was always discussed, just as all school subjects, and analyzed in terms of father’s management of his activities through the means of delegating powers to his associates and staff.  
> 
> 就像学校里的所有科目一样，这个问题总是被讨论，并从父亲通过向同事和员工授权来管理自己活动的角度进行分析。

Given your children access to observe you while you work—is, in my experience, rewarding but draining. While writing his ten-volume _History of British India,_ John Stuart Mill’s father allowed John Stuart, who was three years old, to interrupt him every time he encountered a Greek word he had not seen before (he was reading the classics). His father considered raising his children to be of equal importance as his intellectual work.  

让你的孩子在你工作的时候观察你，以我的经验来看，这是值得的，但也是令人精疲力竭的。约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒的父亲在写十卷本的《英属印度史》时，每当他遇到一个从未见过的希腊词时（当时他正在读经典著作），就允许三岁的约翰·斯图亚特打断他。他的父亲认为抚养孩子和他的智力工作同等重要。

Not everyone who grew to be exceptional was this lucky. There are a few cases of people who rose to greatness despite their non-ideal circumstances—like Ramanujan and Michael Faraday. But they, too, were the fruit of exceptional milieus. They just had to [summon it themselves](https://escapingflatland.substack.com/p/first-we-shape-our-social-graph-then#%C2%A7curating-your-input). How did they do that?  

并不是每个成长为杰出人物的人都这么幸运。有一些人在不理想的环境下成长为伟大的人，比如拉马努金和迈克尔·法拉第。但它们也是特殊环境的产物。他们只需要自己召唤它。他们是怎么做到的？

First, they did this by reading books, by self-teaching. Second, when they grew more skilled they started reaching out to exceptional people, trying to convince them to bring them into their milieu.  

首先，他们通过阅读书籍，自学。第二，当他们的技能越来越强时，他们开始接触优秀的人，试图说服他们把他们带到自己的环境中。  

Ramanujan famously sent letters to a large number of English mathematicians, until one of them, G.H. Hardy, realized that this strange kid writing letters from India was not actually a crank but a raw genius and brought him over to Cambridge.  

拉马努金著名的发送信件给大量的英语数学家，直到其中之一，G.H.哈代意识到这个从印度写信的奇怪的孩子实际上不是一个怪人，而是一个原始的天才，并把他带到剑桥。  

(There were also college students who lodged in Ramanujan’s house as a child in Erode, so he could possibly have been tutored by them, too.)  

（也有大学生在拉马努金小时候住在他家，所以他可能也接受过他们的辅导。）

Faraday grew up in poverty in early 1800s London. He spent less than a year in school and then ended up as a book binder’s apprentice (the same fate as struck Benjamin Franklin). The bookbinder, [George Riebau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Riebau), seems to have been a decent intellectual role model, but more importantly—he gave Faraday access to books. After having read [Isaac Watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Watts)’ [_The Improvement of the Mind_](https://archive.org/details/suppimproveofmin00wattuoft), an intellectual self-help book, Faraday started attending scientific lectures where he took copious notes. He turned [Humphry Davy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphry_Davy)’s lecture series into a book, bound it, and gave it to him. That, Davy thought, was a nice gesture and, after first having ruined his eyes in an experiment with nitrogen trichloride, accepted Faraday as an apprentice in his lab.  

法拉第在19世纪初的伦敦贫困中长大。他在学校里待了不到一年，最后成了一个装订工的学徒（和本杰明·富兰克林的命运一样）。装订工乔治Riebau）似乎是一个体面的知识分子榜样，但更重要的是--他让法拉第接触到了书籍。在读了艾萨克·瓦特的《心灵的改善》（The Improvement of the Mind）这本智力自助书之后，法拉第开始参加科学讲座，并在讲座上做了大量笔记。他把汉弗莱·戴维的系列讲座编成一本书，装订成册，送给了他。戴维认为，这是一个很好的姿态，在第一次用三氯化氮做实验时，他的眼睛受了伤，于是他接受法拉第在他的实验室当学徒。

Books can, in other words, be a good stand-in for a social milieu, up to a point, but eventually, you need direct access to exceptional people. And having access to them from a young age greatly increases the likelihood that you will be shaped by them.  

换句话说，在一定程度上，书籍可以成为社会环境的一个很好的替代品，但最终，你需要直接接触到杰出的人。从很小的时候就接触到它们会大大增加你被它们塑造的可能性。

## **They had time to roam about and relied heavily on self-directed learning  

他们有时间四处漫游，并严重依赖于自主学习**

This freedom from peer pressure was certainly true of Russell.  

这种免受同侪压力的自由，对罗素来说当然是真实的。  

He was largely kept separate from other children, living secluded in his grandparent's aristocratic mansion, something many biographers lament (just imagine how brilliant he would have been had he just had access to schools!).  

他基本上与其他孩子分开，隐居在他祖父的贵族豪宅里，这是许多传记作家所哀叹的（想象一下，如果他能上学，他会有多聪明!）

In his loneliness, Russell was also kept idle. His grandmother, who was his guardian, was, Russell writes in his autobiography, “always afraid that I should overwork, and kept my hours of lessons very short.”  

孤独的罗素也无所事事。罗素在自传中写道，他的祖母是他的监护人，她“总是担心我会过度劳累，所以我上课的时间很短。”

The “most important hours” of his days were spent alone, walking around the gardens at Pembroke Lodge which “seemed to remember the days of its former splendor, when foreign ambassadors paced its lawns, and princes admired its trim beds of flowers” but was now growing gradually more neglected, with shrubs growing over the paths and the box hedges turning into trees.  

他一天中“最重要的时光”都是独自度过的，在彭布罗克旅馆的花园里散步，“似乎还记得它昔日辉煌的日子，那时外国大使们在草坪上踱步，王子们欣赏着它修剪整齐的花坛”，但现在却逐渐变得越来越不受重视，灌木长满了小径，箱形树篱变成了树木。

> 
> 我认为，在年轻人中，不受外界影响的浏览时间是很重要的，因为这给予了他们时间来形成这些表面上短暂但实际上至关重要的印象。

Russell’s childhood seems a little depressing, as did Virginia Woolf’s.  

罗素的童年似乎有点压抑，弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫也是如此。  

In a letter to her brother Thoby, who had been sent off to boarding school, Woolf lamented: ”I have to delve from books, painfully and alone, what you get every evening sitting over your fire and smoking your pipe with Strachey etc.”)  

在写给被送进寄宿学校的弟弟托比的信中，伍尔夫哀叹道：“我不得不痛苦而孤独地钻研书本，每天晚上坐在炉火旁，和斯特雷奇一起抽烟斗，等等。”）

But this immersion in boredom is also a universal in the biographies of exceptional people.  

但这种沉浸在无聊中的状态在杰出人物的传记中也是普遍存在的。  

A substantial fraction were completely kept apart from other children, either because their guardians decided so or because they were bedridden with various illnesses during childhood (like Descartes). A spicy hypothesis raised by this is that socializing too much with children is simply not good for your intellectual development. (I’m not going to test that hypothesis!)  

有相当一部分儿童被完全隔离，要么是因为他们的监护人决定这样做，要么是因为他们在童年时期因各种疾病而卧床不起（如笛卡尔）。由此提出的一个辛辣的假设是，与孩子交往太多对你的智力发展根本没有好处。（我不打算检验这个假设！）

A common theme in the biographies is that the area of study which would eventually give them fame came to them almost like a wild hallucination induced by overdosing on boredom. They would be overcome by an obsession arising from within.  

传记中的一个共同主题是，最终会给他们带来名声的研究领域对他们来说几乎就像是厌倦过度引起的疯狂幻觉。他们会被内心产生的痴迷所征服。

Mozart was drilled on the piano and violin by his father, but the compositions he undertook on his own.  

莫扎特的钢琴和小提琴是由他父亲训练的，但他的作品是自己创作的。

Pascal, as we have already mentioned, wrote several of Euclid’s proofs after self-teaching math in his spare time.  

帕斯卡，正如我们已经提到，写了几个欧几里得的证明后，自学数学在他的业余时间。

Alan Turing, who was raised in boarding schools, also seems to have self-taught a lot of mathematics (at fifteen, he derived the inverse tangent function before having encountered calculus!  

阿兰·图灵在寄宿学校长大，他似乎也自学了很多数学（15岁时，他在遇到微积分之前就推导出了反正切函数！  

) while being an outcast at school and facing resistance from the teachers, who thought his interests were not ”well-rounded”.  

）同时，他还是学校的弃儿，面临着老师们的抵制，老师们认为他的兴趣不够“全面”。

Another case is Maxwell, the Scottish mathematician who unified electricity and magnetism in a series of equations of such power that the Austrian physicist Boltzmann proclaimed, _War es ein Gott, der diese Zeichen schrieb?_ Was it a God that wrote these signs?  

另一个例子是苏格兰数学家麦克斯韦，他用一系列方程统一了电和磁，这些方程的力量之大，以至于奥地利物理学家玻尔兹曼宣称：War es ein Gott，der diese Zeichen schrieb？是上帝写的这些符号吗？

James Clerk Maxwell grew up in relative isolation, in Glenlair, a country house on the Middlebie estate in southwest Scotland in the 1830s. At an early age, Maxwell grew fascinated by geometry and rediscovered the [regular polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polyhedra) before receiving any formal instruction. His parents tried hiring a tutor, but Maxwell, when hit over the head by his tutor, ran out into a lake and refused to come back in until his parents fired his tutor.  

19世纪30年代，詹姆斯·克拉克·麦克斯韦在苏格兰西南部米德尔比庄园的乡村别墅格伦莱尔（Glenlair）相对孤立地长大。麦克斯韦在很小的时候就迷上了几何学，在接受任何正式的指导之前就重新发现了正多面体。他的父母试图聘请一名家庭教师，但麦克斯韦，当击中头部的导师，跑到一个湖，并拒绝回来，直到他的父母解雇了他的导师。  

Instead of being tutored, his first ten years were spent reading novels with his mother, discussing farm improvements with father, climbing trees, doing mischief, and exploring the fields and the woods and the birds and the beasts.  

他头十年没有接受辅导，而是和母亲一起阅读小说，和父亲讨论农场的改良，爬树，恶作剧，探索田野、树林、鸟兽。

Let me sum up what I’ve said so far.  

让我总结一下我到目前为止所说的话。  

A lot of care went into curating the environment around the children—fascinating guests were invited, libraries were built, machines were brought home and disassembled—but the children were left with a lot of time to freely explore the interests that arose within these milieus.  

很多人精心策划了孩子们周围的环境邀请了迷人的客人，建造了图书馆，把机器带回家拆卸了，但是孩子们有很多时间自由地探索这些环境中产生的兴趣。

A qualified guess is that they spent between one and four hours daily in formal studies, and the rest on self-directed projects.  

一个合理的猜测是，他们每天花1到4个小时在正式学习上，其余的时间用于自主项目。  

Unlike children today, they had little access to entertainment, and so were often bored, unless they figured out a way to keep their minds occupied; the intellectual obsessions that grew into their life’s work often grew out of this boredom.  

不像今天的孩子，他们很少有机会获得娱乐，所以经常感到无聊，除非他们找到一种方法来保持他们的思想占领;成为他们毕生工作的智力痴迷往往源于这种无聊。

## **They were heavily tutored 1-on-1  

他们接受了一对一的严格辅导**

_All were likely tutored at some point; ~70 percent were tutored for more than an hour a day growing up. I’m basically making these numbers up; it is an informed guess.  

所有人都可能在某个时候接受过辅导;~ 70%的人在成长过程中每天接受超过一个小时的辅导。这些数字基本上都是我编出来的这是有根据猜测。_

When it comes to formal instruction, an important element is tutoring. Some do all of their formal learning this way (such as John Stuart Mill), others have it as a complement to schooling (such as Albert Einstein, who had a number of math-focused tutors outside of school).  

说到正式教学，一个重要的因素是辅导。有些人以这种方式完成所有的正规学习（如约翰·斯图尔特·穆勒），另一些人则将其作为学校教育的补充（如阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦，他在校外有许多专注于数学的导师）。  

Erik Hoel, who has written a series of great essays about why we stopped making Einsteins ([here](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-we-stopped-making-einsteins), [here](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/follow-up-why-we-stopped-making-einsteins), and [here](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/how-geniuses-used-to-be-raised)), singled out “aristocratic tutoring” as the most important factor. (In this term, Erik includes not only tutoring, in its classical sense, but also more casual interactions between children and competent adults.)  

埃里克·霍尔（Erik Hoel）写了一系列关于我们为什么不再制造爱因斯坦的伟大论文（这里，这里，还有这里），他挑出"贵族家教"作为最重要的因素。(In这个词不仅包括传统意义上的辅导，还包括孩子和有能力的成年人之间更随意的互动。

He writes:  

他写道：

> Aristocratic tutoring was not focused on measurables.  
> 
> 贵族教育并不注重可测量的东西。  
> 
> Historically, it usually involved a paid adult tutor, who was an expert in the field, spending significant time with a young child or teenager, instructing them but also engaging them in discussions, often in a live-in capacity, fostering both knowledge but also engagement with intellectual subjects and fields.  
> 
> 从历史上看，它通常涉及一个付费的成人导师，他是该领域的专家，花大量时间与幼儿或青少年在一起，指导他们，但也让他们参与讨论，往往是以住校的身份，培养知识，但也参与智力科目和领域。

The importance of tutoring, in its more narrow definition as in _actively instructing someone_, is tied to a phenomenon known as [Bloom’s 2-sigma problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem), after the educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom who in the 1980s claimed to have found that tutored students  

家教的重要性，在其更狭义的定义，即被动地指导某人，是与一个现象，称为布卢姆的2-西格玛问题，后教育心理学家本杰明布卢姆谁在20世纪80年代声称已经发现，辅导学生

> . . . performed two standard deviations better than students who learn via conventional instructional methods—that is, “the average tutored student was above 98% of the students in the control class.”  
> 
> 。。。他们的表现比通过传统教学方法学习的学生好两个标准差，也就是说，“接受辅导的学生平均超过对照班学生的98%。”

Simply put, if you tailor your instruction to a single individual, you can make it fit so much better to their minds, so that the average person, if tutored, would become top two in a class of a hundred. The truth is a little bit more complicated than that (and I recommend [Nintil’s systematic review of the research](https://nintil.com/bloom-sigma/) if you want to get into the weeds), but the effect is nevertheless real and big. Tutoring is a more reliable method to impart knowledge than lectures. It is also faster.  

简而言之，如果你为一个人量身定制你的教学，你可以让它更适合他们的思想，以至于普通人，如果接受辅导，将成为100人的班级中的前两名。事实要比这复杂一点（如果你想深入研究的话，我推荐Nintil对这项研究进行系统的回顾），但效果仍然是真实的和巨大的。家教是比讲课更可靠的传授知识的方法。它也更快。

When I worked as a teacher, I had students who were disruptive in a way that made them rarely learn anything during class. To make sure they didn’t fall behind, I would tutor them 1-on-1.  

当我当老师的时候，我有过一些学生，他们在课堂上很难学到任何东西。为了确保他们不掉队，我会一对一辅导他们。  

And, though these were children with deep emotional problems, I found I could usually progress two to four times faster with them alone than I could with the class.  

而且，尽管这些孩子都有严重的情绪问题，我发现我和他们单独相处的时候，进步的速度通常比和全班同学一起学习快两到四倍。

If you do this for 1-4 hours daily, you can go much deeper earlier, even more so if the child is uncommonly motivated and gifted. This also means more time for free exploration, self-directed learning and developing meaningful relationships.  

如果你每天这样做1-4个小时，你可以更早地深入，甚至更多，如果孩子是罕见的动机和天赋。这也意味着有更多的时间自由探索、自主学习和发展有意义的关系。

Many of the tutors in the biographies are not particularly inspiring, however. Leo Tolstoy’s tutor, for example, seems a rather stereotypical teacher of the older stripe:  

然而，传记中的许多导师并不是特别鼓舞人心。例如，列夫·托尔斯泰的导师似乎是一位相当典型的老教师：

> Next, when we came to our writing lesson, the tears kept falling from my eyes \[because I wanted to be with my mother\] and, making a mess on the paper \[. . . my tutor\] Karl was very angry.  
> 
> 接下来，当我们来到我们的写作课，眼泪不停地从我的眼睛里掉下来\[因为我想和我的母亲在一起\]，并在纸上弄得一团糟\[。。。我的导师\]卡尔很生气。  
> 
> He ordered me to go down upon my knees, declared that it was all obstinacy and “puppet-comedy playing” (a favourite expression of his) on my part, threatened me with the ruler, and commanded me to say that I was sorry. Yet for sobbing and crying I could not get a word out.  
> 
> 他命令我跪下，宣称这完全是我的固执和“木偶戏”（他最喜欢的表达方式），用统治者威胁我，命令我说对不起。然而，我哭着哭着，一句话也说不出来。

This is from Tolstoy’s autobiography _Childhood_, written when he was 23, a book which is infamously fictionalized—but the portrayal of Karl has been described as accurate by people who knew Tolstoy’s real-life tutor, Friedrich Rössel.  

这是托尔斯泰23岁时写的自传《童年》，这本书是臭名昭著的虚构作品--但认识托尔斯泰现实生活中的导师弗里德里希·罗塞尔的人都说，对卡尔的描绘是准确的。

Russell was also abused by several of his tutors and governesses. Maxwell, as I mentioned, escaped his.  

罗素还受到他的几个家庭教师和家庭教师的虐待。麦克斯韦，正如我提到的，逃脱了他的。

But there were also tutors who were able to forge deep and meaningful connections with their pupils, where the learning became a shared intellectual pursuit.  

但也有导师能够与学生建立深刻而有意义的联系，在那里学习成为一种共同的智力追求。

John von Neumann’s father would get so excited about their discussions that if they were, say, talking about machine weaving, he would set out to find a Jacquard automatic loom they could study.  

约翰冯诺依曼的父亲会得到如此兴奋，他们的讨论，如果他们是，比如说，谈论机器编织，他会着手寻找一个雅卡尔自动织机，他们可以研究。

Marie Curie’s father built a laboratory in their apartment so they could study chemistry.  

玛丽·居里的父亲在他们的公寓里建了一个实验室，这样他们就可以学习化学了。

Mozart’s father was a devoted tutor to his children, with a deep love for music.  

莫扎特的父亲是他孩子们的忠实家庭教师，对音乐有着深深的热爱。

One of Virginia Woolf’s tutors, the classics scholar and women’s right activist [Janet Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Elizabeth_Case), was so dear and important to Woolf that she wrote Case’s obituary nearly 40 years later.  

弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫的导师之一，古典文学学者和女权活动家珍妮特·凯斯，对伍尔夫来说是如此的亲密和重要，以至于她在将近40年后为凯斯写了讣告。

These inspiring tutors tend to be singled out as more important than the abusive or boring ones in the autobiographies. That can be a reflection of how the authors felt about them, not what actually caused their greatness, of course. But I think this assessment is likely right.  

这些鼓舞人心的导师往往被挑出来，因为他们比自传中辱骂或无聊的导师更重要。当然，那可以反映作者对他们的感受，而不是真正导致他们伟大的原因。但我认为这种评估可能是正确的。  

Helping another person grow rapidly requires a deep and delicate bond, in my experience.  

根据我的经验，帮助他人快速成长需要深厚而微妙的纽带。  

A tutor can be demanding, expecting sincere effort from you, but if the firmness does not come from a place of respect—if they do not signal that they truly believe you are capable of more than _you_ think—harshness is degrading. I doubt the tyrannical tutors were important in shaping long-term trajectories in the cases of Tolstoy or Russell.  

家教可能要求很高，期望你真诚的努力，但是如果这种坚定不是出于尊重如果他们没有表示他们真的相信你有能力比你想象的更好那么严厉就是有辱人格的。我怀疑专制的导师对托尔斯泰或罗素的长期发展轨迹的形成是否起了重要作用。

## **Cognitive apprenticeships  

认知学徒制**

_~90 percent did apprentice themselves at some point. ~30 percent did so before turning 14.  

~ 90%的人在某个时候做过学徒。约30%的人在14岁之前这样做。_

Every morning after breakfast, John Stuart Mill would take a walk with his father. In his _Autobiography,_ he writes:  

每天早餐后，约翰·斯图亚特·密尔都会和他的父亲一起散步。他在自传中写道：

> My father's health required considerable and constant exercise, and he walked habitually before breakfast, generally in the green lanes towards Hornsey.  
> 
> 我父亲的健康状况需要大量和持续的锻炼，他习惯于在早餐前散步，通常是在通往霍恩西的绿色小路上。  
> 
> In these walks I always accompanied him, and with my earliest recollections of green fields and wild flowers, is mingled that of the account I gave him daily of what I had read the day before. To the best of my remembrance, this was a voluntary rather than a prescribed exercise.  
> 
> 在这些散步中，我总是陪着他，在我对绿色田野和野花的最早记忆中，夹杂着我每天给他讲述我前一天读到的东西的记忆。据我所知，这是一项自愿的而不是规定的活动。  
> 
> I made notes on slips of paper while reading, and from these in the morning walks, I told the story to him; for the books were chiefly histories, of which I read in this manner a great number: Robertson's histories, Hume, Gibbon; but my greatest delight, then and for long afterwards, was Watson's _Philip the Second and Third_. \[…\] In these frequent talks about the books I read, he used, as opportunity offered, to give me explanations and ideas respecting civilization, government, morality, mental cultivation, which he required me afterwards to restate to him in my own words.  
> 
> 我阅读时在纸条上做笔记，早晨散步时，我把这些笔记告诉了他;因为书主要是历史，我以这种方式读了很多：罗伯逊的历史，休谟，吉本;但我最大的喜悦，当时和以后很长一段时间，是沃森的菲利普第二和第三。\[...\]在这些关于我读的书的频繁谈话中，他利用机会给予我解释有关文明、政府、道德、精神修养等方面的观点，并要求我事后用自己的话向他重述。  
> 
> He also made me read, and give him a verbal account of, many books which would not have interested me sufficiently to induce me to read them of myself\[.\]  
> 
> 他还让我读了许多书，并给予了他一个口头的帐户，这些书不会引起我足够的兴趣，以诱导我读他们自己\[。\]

These conversations were a [cognitive apprenticeship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_apprenticeship). Learning through apprenticeship is one of the most powerful ways of growing skilled—but if the skills are cognitive, you have to find ways to make the thoughts visible so the apprentice can imitate them.  

这些对话是一种认知学徒。通过学徒制学习是提高技能的最有效的方法之一但是如果技能是认知性的，你就必须想办法让你的想法变得清晰可见，这样学徒才能模仿它们。

James would _model_ patterns of reasoning by thinking aloud and ask John Stuart to recreate his thought, _imitating the thought patterns_. He would give him increasingly complex tasks (books or ideas that he wanted John Stuart to summarize and articulate), then he would _scaffold_ John Stuart by asking questions that helped him solve the task, and he would _coach_ and give feedback on how to improve.  

詹姆斯会通过大声思考来模拟推理模式，并要求约翰·斯图亚特模仿这些思维模式来重现他的想法。他会给予他越来越复杂的任务（他想让约翰·斯图亚特总结和阐述的书籍或想法），然后他会通过问问题帮助约翰·斯图亚特解决任务，他会指导和反馈如何改进。

(James only seems to have been able to do this on walks, however.  

（然而，詹姆斯似乎只能在散步时做到这一点。  

When he tried to instruct his son in the study, he would, perhaps because of the more formal setting, use less effective pedagogies - hammering John Stuart in the head with instructions, failing to give examples or demonstrate the skills he was trying to impart—resulting in a lot of pain and frustration.)   

当他试图在研究中指导儿子时，也许是因为更正式的环境，他会使用不太有效的教学法--用指令敲打约翰·斯图亚特的脑袋，没有给予例子或展示他试图传授的技能--导致了很多痛苦和挫折。）

On the walks, James would refrain from giving lectures until John Stuart had himself struggled with the problems and gotten a visceral feel for their difficulty:  

在散步时，詹姆斯会克制自己不去讲课，直到约翰·斯图亚特亲自与这些问题作斗争，并从内心感受到它们的困难：

> Striving, even in an exaggerated degree, to call forth the activity of my faculties, by making me find out everything for myself, he gave his explanations not before, but after, I had felt the full force of the difficulties\[.\]  
> 
> 努力，甚至在一个夸张的程度，调用我的能力的活动，使我发现自己的一切，他给了他的解释之前，但之后，我已经感受到了困难的全部力量\[。\]

First, these tasks were made up—summaries of stories and the like. But already in his early teens, John Stuart was doing real intellectual work on the walks.  

首先，这些任务是由故事摘要等组成的。但在他十几岁的时候，约翰·斯图亚特就在散步中做了真实的的智力工作。

His first major contribution came at thirteen when James, who had recently finished his _History of British India_, decided to write a didactic treatise on Ricardo’s work on political economy.  

他的第一个重大贡献是在13岁时，詹姆斯刚刚完成了《英属印度史》，他决定写一篇关于李嘉图政治经济学著作的说教性论文。

In writing this work, James Mill leveraged the apprenticeship he had fostered with his son. He began thinking aloud about this new field, political economy, “expound each day a part of the subject”, and asked John Stuart to give him a written summary the next day.  

在写这部作品时，詹姆斯·穆勒利用了他与儿子培养的学徒关系。他开始大声思考政治经济学这个新领域，“每天阐述课题的一部分”，并要求约翰·斯图亚特第二天给予他一份书面总结。  

John Stuart was pretty good at this by now, but this being a work of an altogether new seriousness, it was hard work. They would spend the walks dissecting John Stuart’s summaries “which he made me rewrite over and over again until it was clear, precise, and tolerably complete”.  

约翰·斯图亚特现在已经很擅长这个了，但这是一项全新的严肃性的工作，这是一项艰苦的工作。他们会在散步时仔细分析约翰·斯图亚特的总结，“他让我一遍又一遍地重写，直到它清晰、精确和相当完整”。  

That is: John Stuart externalized his thought, and his father corrected the thoughts and gave feedback until John Stuart’s understanding of political economy converged with his. He also sent John Stuart on walks with Ricardo himself.  

也就是说：约翰·斯图亚特将他的思想外化，他的父亲纠正他的思想并给予反馈，直到约翰·斯图亚特对政治经济学的理解与他的一致。他还派约翰·斯图亚特和李嘉图一起散步。

When they were done, James Mill took his son's notes and polished them into the book _Elements of Political Economy._ It was published the year John Stuart turned fifteen.  

写完后，詹姆斯·穆勒拿着儿子的笔记，把它们润色成《政治经济学基础》（Elements of Political Economy）一书，该书在约翰·斯图亚特15岁那年出版。

This type of intellectual apprenticeship is a recurring pattern in the biographies. At some point in their teenage years—and sometimes earlier—the future geniuses would apprentice themselves intellectually to someone with exceptional capacity in their field.  

这种类型的知识学徒是传记中反复出现的模式。在青少年时期的某个时候，有时甚至更早，未来的天才们会向在他们的领域里有着非凡能力的人学习。

Russell was discovered by Whitehead, one of the world's foremost philosophers and mathematicians, and collaborated with him all through his twenties; Pascal worked with his father; Faraday became Davy’s assistant; Euler was taken on by various members of the Bernoulli family, all extraordinary mathematicians.  

罗素是由怀特海发现的，他是世界上最重要的哲学家和数学家之一，在他20多岁的时候一直与他合作;帕斯卡与他的父亲;法拉第成了戴维的助手;欧拉采取了各种成员的伯努利家庭，所有非凡的数学家。

At this point, they were not only learning, but also doing real intellectual work.  

在这一点上，他们不仅是在学习，而且是在做真实的的智力工作。

## **They were gifted children  

他们是天才儿童**

An important factor to acknowledge is that these children did not only receive an exceptional education; they were also exceptionally gifted.  

必须承认的一个重要因素是，这些儿童不仅接受了特殊教育;他们也有非凡的天赋。

Erik Hoel, in his essays about the education of genius, indicates that tutoring matters a lot more than raw intelligence and other genetic factors. I think this claim is too strong:  

埃里克·霍尔（Erik Hoel）在他关于天才教育的文章中指出，家教比原始智力和其他遗传因素重要得多。我认为这个主张太强了：

> 
> 如果我们有一千个约翰·冯·诺依曼的克隆人，他们与麻省理工学院即将到来的学生将无法区分，不会或多或少令人印象深刻](https://twitter.com/erikphoel/status/1584989710212280320)

> 晚上9：26 ∙ 2022年10月25日](https://twitter.com/erikphoel/status/1584989710212280320)

Erik’s tweet sounds more extreme than it is (MIT is a selective institution); still, the outcome he predicts is highly unlikely given the observations we have.  

Erik的推文听起来比实际更极端（MIT是一个选择性的机构）;然而，根据我们现有的观察，他预测的结果是极不可能的。

Like most of the people sampled in this essay, John von Neumann was fiendishly gifted. He could divide eight-digit numbers in his head at six; I’m a pretty dedicated tutor to my five-year-old, and I can see no path to that type of excellence within the next twelve months.  

就像本文中抽样的大多数人一样，约翰·冯·诺依曼有着魔鬼般的天赋。他能在脑子里把八位数除以六;我是我五岁孩子的一个非常专注的家庭教师，我看不到在未来12个月内有什么道路可以达到这样的卓越。

When von Neumann entered university, George Pólya, another famous mathematician, recounts:  

当冯诺依曼进入大学，乔治波利亚，另一位著名的数学家，叙述：

> There was a seminar for advanced students in Zürich that I was teaching and von Neumann was in the class. I came to a certain theorem, and I said it is not proved and it may be difficult. Von Neumann didn’t say anything but after five minutes he raised his hand.  
> 
> 有一个研讨会的先进学生在苏黎世，我是教学和冯诺依曼是在课堂上。我说到了一个定理，我说它没有被证明，可能很难。冯·诺依曼什么也没说，但五分钟后他举起了手。  
> 
> When I called on him he went to the blackboard and proceeded to write down the proof. After that I was afraid of von Neumann.  
> 
> 我叫他时，他走到黑板前，开始写下证明。从那以后我害怕冯·诺依曼。

If we were to clone von Neumann and for some reason distribute the clones in a random selection of American homes, few if any of them would have the quality of education the original von Neumann had. A few of them might be broken down by toxic family conditions.  

如果我们克隆冯·诺依曼，出于某种原因，将克隆人随机分配到美国的一些家庭中，那么几乎没有人能拥有原来的冯·诺依曼所拥有的教育质量。他们中的一些人可能会被有毒的家庭条件所破坏。  

But the other 950 or so—if they decide to attend MIT at the same time—would probably be _quite a sight_. Maybe not “I’ll invent the computer, game theory, and the hydrogen bomb at the same time” levels of genius; but also not the average MIT class. And who knows, having 950 von Neumanns at the same campus might also supercharge them into world-destroying feats of genius.  

但是其他950人左右--如果他们决定同时进入麻省理工学院--可能会是一个相当大的景象。也许不是“我要同时发明计算机、博弈论和氢弹”的天才水平;但也不是麻省理工学院的平均水平。谁知道呢，在同一个校园里有950个冯·诺依曼，可能也会使他们成为毁灭世界的天才。

The innate talent of those who grow up to be exceptional is particularly clear when it comes to those who excelled in mathematics like this. But we can see the same thing in other fields.  

天生的人才，那些谁长大后是例外是特别明显的，当涉及到那些谁擅长数学这样的。但我们可以在其他领域看到同样的情况。  

Richard Wagner was instructed on the piano by his Latin teacher but dropped out since he was unable to understand scales. Instead, Wagner learned by transcribing theatre music by ear.  

理查德瓦格纳是指示钢琴由他的拉丁语老师，但辍学，因为他无法理解的规模。相反，瓦格纳是通过用耳朵转录戏剧音乐来学习的。  

Once he had reached the end of his natural abilities, he sought out a composer, Christian Gottlieb Müller, and convinced his mother to allow Müller to teach him composition. Wagner was thirteen at the time.  

当他达到了他的自然能力的尽头，他找到了一位作曲家，克里斯蒂安·戈特利布·穆勒，并说服他的母亲允许穆勒教他作曲。瓦格纳当时十三岁。  

Two years later, he was able to transcribe Mozart’s 9th symphony for piano.  

两年后，他能把莫扎特的第九交响曲改编成钢琴曲。

I have known quite a few talented musicians, and that just _never_ happens.  

我认识不少有才华的音乐家，但那从来没有发生过。

This is not to say that the peculiarities of their education were not important and (in whatever regard it fits the lives of you and your child) worth emulating. Access to exceptional role models, and dedicated, personalized education is transformational.  

这并不是说他们教育的特点不重要，不值得效仿（无论在什么方面适合你和你的孩子）。获得杰出的榜样，以及专注的个性化教育是变革性的。  

In some cases, as with John Stuart Mill, it is possible that most of his exceptional skill can be attributed to the education, rather than innate talent.  

在某些情况下，就像约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒一样，他的大部分非凡技能可能归功于教育，而不是天赋。

## If you want to, you can do this, too  

如果你愿意，你也可以这么做

Doing all of this—curating an exceptional milieu, providing dedicated tutoring and opportunities for apprenticeship—is hard work. You could pull it off if you put your mind to it, I trust. Though, like everything pursued to excellence, it would demand serious sacrifices.  

做所有这些策划一个特殊的环境，提供专门的辅导和学徒机会是一项艰苦的工作。我相信，如果你下定决心，你一定能成功的。不过，就像一切追求卓越的事物一样，它需要做出重大牺牲。  

Particularly of time. It is ok not to want that.  

尤其是时间。不想那样也没关系。

A lot of it does not require sacrifices, though. It is just a way of viewing children: as capable of competence, as craving meaningful work, as worthy to be included in serious discussions.  

不过，其中很多并不需要牺牲。这只是一种看待孩子的方式：有能力胜任，渴望有意义的工作，值得参与严肃的讨论。  

We can learn to view them like that, but it is a subtle and profound shift in perception, a shift away from the way we are taught to view children. When I read the biographies, it feels a little bit like getting new peers. Their way of being works on me.  

我们可以学着这样看待他们，但这是一种微妙而深刻的认知转变，一种远离我们被教导看待孩子的方式的转变。当我读传记的时候，感觉有点像得到了新的同龄人。他们的生活方式对我很有效。  

Gradually, I raise my aspirations.  

渐渐地，我提高了我的抱负。

There is a moving scene in John Stuart Mill's biography, when John Stuart is about to set out into the world and his father for the first time lets him know that his education had been . . . a bit particular. He would discover that others his age did not know as much as he did.  

在约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒的传记中有一个感人的场景，当约翰·斯图亚特即将走向世界时，他的父亲第一次让他知道他所受的教育。。。有点特别。他会发现他这个年纪的人并不像他懂得那么多。  

But, his father said, he _mustn’t_ feel proud about that. He’d just been lucky.  

但是，他的父亲说，他不必为此感到骄傲。他只是运气好。

Let’s make more people lucky.  

让我们让更多的人幸运。
