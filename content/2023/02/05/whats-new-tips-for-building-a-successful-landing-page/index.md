Ideas are cheap, but implementing them is not. Most indie hackers don't have the luxury of building all the features they may want. Choosing between features is one of the toughest things we have to do.  

想法很便宜，但实施起来却很便宜。大多数独立黑客无法构建他们可能想要的所有功能。在功能之间进行选择是我们必须做的最困难的事情之一。

Here's how indie hackers are making the choice!  

以下是独立黑客如何做出选择！

### Problems, not features  

问题，而不是功能

Don't focus on the features. Focus on the problems.  

不要专注于功能。专注于问题。

Feature requests are pretty much inevitable once you've got traction. And that's a good thing! When it comes to feature requests, focus on your actual customers. These are the people who are all about your product, not the ones who are on the fence.  

一旦你有吸引力，功能请求几乎是不可避免的。这是一件好事！当涉及到功能请求时，请关注您的实际客户。这些人都是关心你的产品的人，而不是持观望态度的人。  

Eventually, you'll want to understand how to bring the stragglers into the fold, but that can wait until you've got more time on your hands.  

最终，您会想要了解如何将散兵游勇纳入其中，但这可以等到您有更多时间时再进行。

Founder [Matt Naus](https://www.indiehackers.com/chillyorange) breaks it down:  

创始人 Matt Naus 对此进行了分解：

> Ideally, your product will have actual users who are providing you with feedback.  
> 
> 理想情况下，您的产品会有实际用户为您提供反馈。  
> 
> If you do not have actual users yet, you will need to collect data based on conversations with your target audience (and you should be doing the absolute minimum to turn these people into users).  
> 
> 如果您还没有实际用户，您将需要根据与目标受众的对话来收集数据（并且您应该尽最大努力将这些人转变为用户）。
> 
> If you’ve got no users or audience, you should not be building any features. At this stage, you should not be thinking about features, nor should you be doing any development.  
> 
> 如果您没有用户或受众，则不应构建任何功能。在此阶段，您不应该考虑功能，也不应该进行任何开发。

Here's some solid advice from [Reinder](https://www.indiehackers.com/Reinder/history) on talking to users:  

以下是 Reinder 关于与用户交谈的一些可靠建议：

> Keep in mind that users own the problem, and you own the solution. This means that you should not ask them what to build, but question them about the problems they experience. Create your backlog based on the solutions that you see.  
> 
> 请记住，用户拥有问题，而您拥有解决方案。这意味着您不应该问他们要构建什么，而应该询问他们遇到的问题。根据您看到的解决方案创建积压工作。

Surveys, interviews, or allowing users to vote on new features can help, too. If you're going to do interviews, I'd highly recommend reading [The Mom Test](https://www.momtestbook.com/) first.  

调查、访谈或允许用户对新功能进行投票也会有所帮助。如果您要接受采访，我强烈建议您先阅读 The Mom Test。

Of course, it's important to validate that this feedback is actually good. The last thing you want is to build things for customers that don't actually push the needle for your business.  

当然，重要的是要验证此反馈是否确实良好。您最不想做的就是为客户构建实际上不会推动您的业务发展的东西。

### Reasons to build that new feature  

构建该新功能的原因

Ultimately, there are three good reasons to add a new feature:  

最终，添加新功能的三个充分理由：

1.  User acquisition.  
    
    用户获取。
2.  Paid conversions (free to paid, upsells, etc.).  
    
    付费转化（免费到付费、追加销售等）。
3.  Retention.  
    
    保留。

Don't do it because someone told you to. Don't do it because you're avoiding marketing, which happens more often than most would like to admit. Don't do it to keep up with the competition, unless it actually benefits your product. I could go on, but you get the idea.  

不要因为有人告诉你就去做。不要因为避免营销而这样做，这种情况发生的频率比大多数人愿意承认的要高。不要为了跟上竞争而这样做，除非它确实有利于您的产品。我可以继续，但你明白了。

So, the first thing indie hackers have to do when considering new features is to determine what they need to achieve: Is it user acquisition, paid conversions, or retention?  

因此，独立黑客在考虑新功能时必须做的第一件事就是确定他们需要实现的目标：是用户获取、付费转化还是留存？

Once you know your "why," you have to figure out whether the feature you're considering actually moves the needle for it.  

一旦你知道你的“为什么”，你就必须弄清楚你正在考虑的功能是否真正推动了它。

### Validating and prioritizing features  

验证功能并确定其优先级

When thinking about new features, consider a few things:  

在考虑新功能时，请考虑以下几点：

-   Business value: Does it push the needle on one of the three reasons that I mentioned above?  
    
    商业价值：它是否推动了我上面提到的三个原因之一？
-   User relevance: Is it relevant to all of your users, or just a few?  
    
    用户相关性：它与您的所有用户相关，还是仅与少数用户相关？
-   Value to users: How valuable is it? Will they pay for it?  
    
    对用户的价值：它有多有价值？他们会为此付出代价吗？
-   Complexity and implementation effort: This plays a role in the prioritization frameworks below.  
    
    复杂性和实施工作：这在下面的优先级框架中发挥作用。
-   Is there currently a sufficient workaround? If so, the feature may not be necessary.  
    
    目前是否有足够的解决方法？如果是这样，则可能不需要该功能。
-   Usage: How often will it be used?  
    
    使用：多久使用一次？
-   Is it easily communicated? If not, it might not get any user adoption.  
    
    是否容易沟通？否则，它可能得不到任何用户的采用。
-   Positioning: Will it strengthen your brand or your position in the market?  
    
    定位：它会加强您的品牌或您在市场中的地位吗？
-   Does it create a "wow" moment? That can sometimes be worth it, _if_ it helps with retention.  
    
    它会创造一个“哇”的时刻吗？如果它有助于保留，有时这是值得的。
-   Will it reduce decision-making time for potential customers?  
    
    它会减少潜在客户的决策时间吗？

Once you've made a decision about whether something is worth trying, test an MVP of the feature before building the whole thing.  

一旦你决定某件事是否值得尝试，在构建整个事情之前测试该功能的 MVP。

Here are four frameworks for prioritizing features:  

以下是确定功能优先级的四个框架：

-   [DIE](https://baremetrics.com/blog/feature-framework): Measure demand, impact, and effort using [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BXuFcn-M2E6Mbz7DxKDB3SsCWlXS036wxR89s6I8qC0/edit?usp=sharing). It's set up so that you'll actually want the lowest number possible, which is created by high demand, high impact, and low effort.  
    
    DIE：使用此电子表格衡量需求、影响和工作量。它的设置是为了让您实际上想要尽可能少的数量，这是由高需求、高影响和低努力创造的。
-   [Value vs. Effort Quadrant](https://foldingburritos.com/product-prioritization-techniques/): This one is great because it's quick and easy. To use this, rate a feature's value to the business, and the difficulty to implement it. Plot the resulting point on a quadrant chart. The sweet spot is the highest value with the lowest effort.  
    
    价值与努力象限：这个象限很棒，因为它快速简单。要使用它，请评估功能对业务的价值以及实施它的难度。在象限图上绘制结果点。最佳点是用最少的努力获得最高的价值。
-   [Prioritize by Constraints](https://plan.io/blog/feature-prioritization/): If you're short on specific resources, you can prioritize based on what you have. If you can't afford something, it gets delayed and something else is prioritized. This can be used along with other methods.  
    
    按约束确定优先级：如果您缺少特定资源，则可以根据现有资源确定优先级。如果你买不起某样东西，它就会被推迟，而其他的东西会被优先考虑。这可以与其他方法一起使用。
-   [RICE Method](https://plan.io/blog/feature-prioritization/): Indie hackers love this one. You rate the reach (how many people it'll impact in a certain timeframe), impact, confidence that it will deliver a desired result, and effort.  
    
    RICE 方法：独立黑客喜欢这个方法。您对影响范围（在特定时间范围内会影响多少人）、影响、对实现预期结果的信心和努力进行评分。  
    
    Then, figure out the total impact per time worked with this equation: Reach x Impact x Confidence / Effort.  
    
    然后，计算出每次使用此等式的总影响：达到 x 影响 x 信心/努力。

### Fix your product first  

先修复你的产品

Before you even think about adding new features, make sure that your current features are in a good place.  

在您甚至考虑添加新功能之前，请确保您当前的功能处于合适的位置。

From there, add them to your project management or to-do tool. I'm personally a fan of [public roadmaps](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/reduce-churn-by-sharing-your-product-roadmap-3f1ce7cdd7), so if you are too, add the new features to yours with a reasonable timeline. Then, get to work!  

从那里，将它们添加到您的项目管理或待办事项工具中。我个人是公共路线图的粉丝，所以如果您也是，请在合理的时间表内将新功能添加到您的路线图。然后，开始工作！
