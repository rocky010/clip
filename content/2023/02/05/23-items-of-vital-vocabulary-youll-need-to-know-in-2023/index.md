## Passkeys? Post-quantum cryptography? Vertiports? Get up to speed here  

密码？后量子密码学？垂直起降？在这里加快速度

Nov 14th 2022  

2022 年 11 月 14 日

By Martin Adams, Aryn Braun, Joel Budd, Tom Standage and Vijay Vaitheeswaran  

作者：Martin Adams、Aryn Braun、Joel Budd、Tom Standage 和 Vijay Vaitheeswaran

In 2020 and 2021 the world embarked on a crash course in epidemiology and vaccinology. Novel expressions such as “flattening the curve”, “viral load”, “spike protein” and “mRNA vaccines” became part of the public discourse. Then in 2022 the war in Ukraine made it grimly necessary to learn new terms, such as “HIM_AR_s” and “counter-battery fire”. What terms of art will enter wider circulation in 2023? **Here are our best 23 guesses, with a definition of each one, to expand your vocabulary for the coming year**  

2020 年和 2021 年，世界开始了流行病学和疫苗学速成班。 “拉平曲线”、“病毒载量”、“刺突蛋白”和“mrna 疫苗”等新词成为公众讨论的一部分。然后在 2022 年，乌克兰战争使得学习新术语变得非常必要，例如“himars”和“counter-battery fire”。哪些艺术术语将在 2023 年进入更广泛的流通领域？这是我们最好的 23 个猜测，每个猜测都有一个定义，以扩展您来年的词汇量

## **Green, blue and brown hydrogen  

绿色、蓝色和棕色氢**

Hydrogen is a colourless gas that burns cleanly, producing just water vapour. Despite being the most abundant element in the universe, it is rarely found on Earth in a pure form.  

氢气是一种无色气体，燃烧干净，只产生水蒸气。尽管它是宇宙中最丰富的元素，但在地球上却很少以纯净形式存在。  

When making pure hydrogen, some methods are much dirtier than others—so energy wonks use different colours to identify them. “Green” hydrogen is made using renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis.  

在制造纯氢时，有些方法比其他方法脏得多——所以能源专家使用不同的颜色来识别它们。 “绿色”氢是利用可再生能源通过电解将水分解成氢和氧制成的。  

Europe is promoting its use, and renewables-rich regions from Australia to India hope to become green-hydrogen exporters. By contrast, making “black” or “brown” hydrogen involves burning coal or lignite, releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide.  

欧洲正在推广它的使用，从澳大利亚到印度等可再生能源丰富的地区希望成为绿色氢的出口国。相比之下，制造“黑色”或“棕色”氢需要燃烧煤或褐煤，释放大量二氧化碳。  

This is cheap but bad for the climate. “Grey” hydrogen is made from natural gas, in a process that also releases carbon dioxide (but less than using coal). “Blue” hydrogen is also made from natural gas, but the resulting carbon dioxide is then captured and stored underground.  

这很便宜，但对气候不利。 “灰色”氢是由天然气制成的，在这个过程中也会释放二氧化碳（但少于使用煤炭）。 “蓝色”氢气也由天然气制成，但产生的二氧化碳随后被捕获并储存在地下。  

Big Oil is excited about this, because in theory it can also be relatively green, if leaks are tightly monitored and controlled. “Turquoise” hydrogen uses a different process to split natural gas, resulting in hydrogen and solid carbon. Several startups are pursuing this approach.  

Big Oil 对此感到兴奋，因为如果泄漏受到严格监控和控制，理论上它也可以相对环保。 “绿松石”氢使用不同的过程来分解天然气，从而产生氢和固体碳。几家初创公司正在采用这种方法。

“Pink” hydrogen is, like the green sort, made using electrolysis, but powered by nuclear energy. Finally, “white” hydrogen is the pure kind that occurs in nature but is rare on Earth.  

与绿色氢气一样，“粉红色”氢气是通过电解制造的，但由核能提供动力。最后，“白色”氢是自然界中存在但在地球上很少见的纯净氢。

## eSIM

Those tiny chips that go into your smartphone and link it to your billing details and phone number—known as subscriber identity modules, or SIMs—are going away. So-called eSIM technology replaces physical chips with digital codes that can be zapped from an old handset to a new one. The technology has been in phones since 2017, but Apple’s decision to launch its iPhone 14 range in America as eSIM\-only handsets will force millions of people to start using it in 2023. As with mice and touchscreens, Apple’s embrace of a technology will be the trigger for widespread adoption. It will push mobile operators around the world to move to eSIMs and make the process of transferring them between devices less clunky. The technology also makes it easier to roam between networks by installing multiple eSIMs—less fiddly than swapping tiny chips.  

那些进入您的智能手机并将其链接到您的账单详细信息和电话号码的微型芯片（称为用户身份模块或 sims）正在消失。所谓的 esim 技术用数字代码取代了物理芯片，这些代码可以从旧手机转移到新手机上。该技术自 2017 年以来一直在手机中使用，但苹果决定在美国推出其 iPhone 14 系列作为纯 esim 手机，这将迫使数百万人在 2023 年开始使用它。与鼠标和触摸屏一样，苹果对这项技术的拥抱将是广泛采用的触发因素。它将推动世界各地的移动运营商转向 esim，并使在设备之间传输它们的过程变得不那么笨拙。该技术还可以通过安装多个 esim 更轻松地在网络之间漫游——比交换微型芯片更简单。

## Post-quantum cryptography  

后量子密码学

Quantum computers exploit the weirdness of the subatomic realm to do things that ordinary computers cannot.  

量子计算机利用亚原子领域的怪异特性来做普通计算机做不到的事情。  

That includes cracking codes: a working quantum computer, if one can be built, could break the encryption that is currently used to secure communications and protect sensitive data.  

这包括破解代码：一台工作的量子计算机，如果可以建造的话，可能会破解目前用于保护通信和保护敏感数据的加密。  

To protect against this possibility, new “post-quantum” cryptography standards, designed to be invulnerable even to quantum computers, were approved in 2022, and preparations for their implementation will begin in earnest in 2023.  

为了防止这种可能性，新的“后量子”密码学标准在 2022 年获得批准，其设计甚至对量子计算机也无懈可击，其实施准备工作将于 2023 年正式开始。

## Mixed reality  

混合现实

Virtual reality (_VR_) is like wearing a digital blindfold—it blots out the real world and immerses you in an alternative, computer-generated reality. Augmented reality (_AR_), by contrast, superimposes computer-generated elements onto your view of the real world. Mixed reality (XR or MR) goes a step further by allowing real and virtual items to interact. For example, you might play a game of table tennis in which the paddles are real, but the ball is computer generated. It is also a less clunky term than augmented reality, and more likely to catch on.  

虚拟现实 (_VR_) 就像戴上了数字眼罩——它遮住了现实世界，让您沉浸在另一种计算机生成的现实中。相比之下，增强现实 (ar) 将计算机生成的元素叠加到您对现实世界的看法上。混合现实（xr 或 mr）更进一步，允许真实和虚拟项目交互。例如，您可能会玩乒乓球游戏，其中球拍是真实的，但球是计算机生成的。与增强现实相比，它也是一个不那么笨拙的术语，而且更有可能流行起来。  

A big question for 2023 is what Apple will choose to call the technology when it announces its first _AR_/_VR_/XR headset—which is rumoured to be powered by software called “realityOS”.  

2023 年的一个大问题是，苹果在宣布其首款 ar/vr/xr 耳机时会选择如何称呼这项技术——据传，这款耳机由名为“realityOS”的软件提供支持。

## Passkeys  

密码

Death to passwords! Passkeys are a new technology, supported by tech giants including Apple, Google and Microsoft, that replace passwords with biometrically validated tokens that are automatically generated and cannot be guessed or forgotten.  

死于密码！万能钥匙是一项新技术，得到了包括苹果、谷歌和_微软_在内的科技巨头的支持，它用自动生成且无法猜测或遗忘的经生物识别验证的令牌取代密码。  

Essentially, instead of typing a password, you use a token, stored on your phone or computer and protected by a fingerprint or facial recognition, to log into apps or websites.  

从本质上讲，您无需输入密码，而是使用存储在手机或计算机上并受指纹或面部识别保护的令牌来登录应用程序或网站。  

Many online services, including eBay, Kayak and PayPal, are using this approach already, and more will follow in 2023 as support for the technology is extended to the latest versions of popular desktop and mobile operating systems.  

包括 eBay、Kayak 和 PayPal 在内的许多在线服务已经在使用这种方法，随着对该技术的支持扩展到流行的桌面和移动操作系统的最新版本，2023 年将有更多服务采用这种方法。

Because a unique passkey is generated for every app or website you use, passkeys prevent many common attacks, such as “phishing” emails that trick users into entering their credentials into a plausible-looking, but bogus, website.  

由于为您使用的每个应用程序或网站生成一个唯一的密码，密码可以防止许多常见的攻击，例如“网络钓鱼”电子邮件，这些电子邮件会诱骗用户将其凭据输入一个看似合理但虚假的网站。  

Passkeys also, by default, stop people from using the same (often easily guessed) password for everything. All this should give online security a big boost—with the added benefit that logging into something by clicking your smartwatch is strangely thrilling.  

默认情况下，密码还会阻止人们对所有内容使用相同（通常很容易猜到）的密码。所有这些都应该大大提高在线安全性——还有一个额外的好处，那就是通过点击你的智能手表登录某些东西是非常令人兴奋的。

## Horizontal and vertical escalation  

水平和垂直升级

How might the conflict in Ukraine escalate in 2023? Military wonks distinguish between two dimensions of escalation. Horizontal escalation is where the geographical scope of a conflict expands (for example, if Russia attacks another country, drawing it into the conflict).  

乌克兰的冲突在 2023 年会如何升级？军事专家区分升级的两个维度。横向升级是冲突地理范围扩大的地方（例如，如果俄罗斯攻击另一个国家，将其拖入冲突）。  

Vertical escalation is where the intensity of the conflict increases, either with attacks on new types of targets, or through the introduction of new types of weapon (such as chemical or nuclear warheads). Neither is good.  

垂直升级是冲突强度增加的地方，要么通过攻击新型目标，要么通过引入新型武器（如化学弹头或核弹头）。两者都不好。

___

## Tactical nuclear weapons  

战术核武器

Might Russia resort to the use of “tactical” nuclear weapons in Ukraine? These tend to have shorter ranges and lower yields than city-busting “strategic” weapons, such as ICBMs. If, say, Ukraine’s forces were about to reclaim Crimea in 2023, Vladimir Putin might be tempted to use one to halt Ukraine’s military advance. But it is unlikely to be very effective: one warhead might destroy just a dozen tanks.  

俄罗斯可能会在乌克兰使用“战术”核武器吗？与洲际弹道导弹等破坏城市的“战略”武器相比，这些武器的射程更短，当量更低。比方说，如果乌克兰军队即将在 2023 年收复克里米亚，弗拉基米尔·普京 (Vladimir Putin) 可能会想动用一支军队来阻止乌克兰的军事推进。但它不太可能非常有效：一枚弹头可能只会摧毁十几辆坦克。  

Mr Putin might instead opt to detonate a small nuke over the Black Sea as a warning. But allies such as China might then abandon him. And the West would surely respond, perhaps hitting Russian targets in Ukraine with conventional weapons.  

普京可能会选择在黑海上空引爆一枚小型核弹作为警告。但中国等盟友可能会抛弃他。西方肯定会做出回应，也许会用常规武器打击俄罗斯在乌克兰的目标。  

Tit-for-tat attacks then risk leading to an exchange of much more powerful strategic weapons. “Tactical” is, in short, a misnomer when it comes to nukes: they are inherently, perilously strategic.  

针锋相对的攻击有可能导致更强大的战略武器的交换。简而言之，当谈到核武器时，“战术”一词用词不当：它们本质上具有危险的战略意义。

## Frozen conflict  

冰冻冲突

A frozen conflict is a military stand-off in which actual combat has ceased, but there has been no resolution of the underlying conflict (for example, through a peace treaty or political settlement)—so there is a risk that hostilities might restart at any time.  

冻结冲突是一种军事对峙，其中实际战斗已经停止，但潜在的冲突没有得到解决（例如，通过和平条约或政治解决）——因此存在敌对行动可能随时重新开始的风险时间。  

They are often the result of big-power meddling. Vladimir Putin has created several frozen conflicts in parts of the former Soviet Union (including, from late 2014 until early 2022, in eastern Ukraine) as a way of destabilising neighbouring countries.  

它们通常是大国干预的结果。弗拉基米尔·普京 (Vladimir Putin) 在前苏联部分地区（包括从 2014 年底到 2022 年初在乌克兰东部）制造了数起冻结的冲突，作为破坏邻国稳定的一种方式。  

Such conflicts can last decades, as with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Russia-backed republics that broke away from Georgia in the early 1990s. In 2023, Russian weakness may mean that some of these frozen conflicts start to thaw.  

此类冲突可能会持续数十年，例如南奥塞梯和阿布哈兹，这些由俄罗斯支持的共和国在 1990 年代初脱离格鲁吉亚。 2023 年，俄罗斯的疲软可能意味着其中一些冻结的冲突开始解冻。

## Regasification  

再气化

Natural gas is normally delivered via pipelines, because unlike oil, it is difficult to load and unload onto ships. This makes natural-gas markets much less liquid than those for oil, because a pipeline is generally needed between buyer and seller. But liquefied natural gas (LNG) changes the equation. Cooling natural gas down to -162°C turns it into a liquid and reduces its volume 600-fold, enabling it to be transported over long distances using special, cryogenically cooled tanker ships.  

天然气通常通过管道输送，因为与石油不同，它很难装卸到船上。这使得天然气市场的流动性远低于石油市场，因为买卖双方之间通常需要一条管道。但是液化天然气 (lng) 改变了这个等式。将天然气冷却至 -162°C 将其变成液体并将其体积缩小 600 倍，从而使其能够使用特殊的低温冷却油轮进行长距离运输。

This allows for global trade in natural gas—handy for European countries that wish to reduce their reliance on Russian gas delivered by pipelines. Lately, European countries have instead been buying it from America or Qatar, two big LNG exporters. Turning LNG back into a gas, so that it can be fed into pipelines and used as a fuel, is called regasification. This normally takes place at a coastal LNG terminal. But building onshore facilities takes time, so a quicker solution is to lease ships, called “floating storage and regasification units”, to do the job. Germany’s government has chartered five such ships to boost its LNG import capacity.  

这使得全球天然气贸易成为可能——对于希望减少对通过管道输送的俄罗斯天然气的依赖的欧洲国家来说非常方便。最近，欧洲国家转而从美国或卡塔尔这两个大型液化天然气出口国购买。将液化天然气转回气体，以便将其送入管道并用作燃料，这称为再气化。这通常发生在沿海液化天然气接收站。但建造陆上设施需要时间，因此更快的解决方案是租用称为“浮式储存和再气化装置”的船只来完成这项工作。德国政府已经租用了五艘这样的船来提高其液化天然气进口能力。

## Aridification  

干旱化

At what point is drought, or even megadrought, no longer sufficient to describe a dry period? In some places scientists and officials now talk instead of aridification, or the long-term drying of a region.  

在什么时候干旱甚至特大干旱不再足以描述干旱期？在一些地方，科学家和官员现在谈论的不是干旱，也不是一个地区的长期干旱。  

Higher temperatures caused by climate change have plenty of knock-on effects. In already arid regions such as southern Europe, coastal Australia and southern Africa, climate change is shrinking mountain snowpack and drying out rivers, soils and forests.  

气候变化导致的高温会产生很多连锁反应。在欧洲南部、澳大利亚沿海和非洲南部等本已干旱的地区，气候变化正在缩小山区积雪并使河流、土壤和森林干涸。  

In California, Spain and elsewhere, summer brings the threat of ever-more severe wildfires. In 2023, these regions will grapple with hotter temperatures, more intense wildfires and less water.  

在加利福尼亚、西班牙和其他地方，夏季带来了越来越严重的野火威胁。到 2023 年，这些地区将努力应对更热的气温、更猛烈的野火和更少的水。  

Aridification will force agricultural powerhouses, such as California and China, to reckon with shrinking water supplies. And parched cities will worry that it could put a ceiling on population growth.  

干旱化将迫使加利福尼亚和中国等农业强国考虑水资源供应的减少。炎热的城市会担心这会限制人口增长。

![](20221129_SSD008.jpg)

## Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions  

范围 1、2 和 3 排放

Scope 1 emissions are those directly caused by a company’s activities, such as burning fuel in factories or vehicles. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions (from a power station, for example) that result from a firm’s energy use.  

范围 1 排放是指公司活动直接引起的排放，例如在工厂或车辆中燃烧燃料。范围 2 排放是公司能源使用产生的间接排放（例如，来自发电站）。  

Scope 3 emissions are all other emissions that arise from the activities of a company’s suppliers and customers. For an oil company, the emissions that result when the oil it sells is burned by others are Scope 3 emissions. Should firms be liable for such emissions?  

范围 3 排放是公司供应商和客户活动产生的所有其他排放。对于一家石油公司而言，其销售的石油被其他公司燃烧所产生的排放属于范围 3 排放。企业是否应对此类排放负责？  

In 2023, expect more regulators to argue that they should.  

到 2023 年，预计会有更多监管机构提出他们应该这么做。

___

![](20221129_SSD009.jpg)

## Resilience hubs and cool pavements  

弹性中心和凉爽的人行道

Cities around the world are adopting various measures to deal with the threat of heatwaves, which are increasing in frequency and severity, and put old and infirm people at particular risk.  

世界各地的城市都在采取各种措施来应对热浪的威胁，热浪的频率和严重程度都在增加，并且使年老体弱的人处于特别危险的境地。  

Resilience hubs are designated buildings—or, in some cases, pods made from shipping containers—within a community that provide air-conditioned places of refuge with drinking water, internet access and phone-charging facilities.  

恢复力中心是社区内指定的建筑物——或者，在某些情况下，是由集装箱制成的豆荚——提供空调避难所、饮用水、互联网接入和电话充电设施。  

Cities are also reducing temperatures by introducing cool roofs (covered with white paint or reflective materials) and cool pavements (treated with special coatings) to reflect sunlight away and absorb less heat.  

城市还通过引入凉爽的屋顶（覆盖有白色油漆或反光材料）和凉爽的人行道（经过特殊涂层处理）来反射阳光并减少吸收热量，从而降低温度。  

Cities pioneering cool sidewalks and road surfaces include Los Angeles, Phoenix and Tokyo.  

开创凉爽人行道和路面的城市包括洛杉矶、凤凰城和东京。

___

## Dead pool  

死池

Most people will associate “dead pool” with Marvel’s sarcastic anti-hero, played by Ryan Reynolds on the silver screen. In America’s western states, however, it has a different meaning. Most of the West’s big reservoirs were created by damming rivers in the 20th century.  

大多数人会将“死水池”与银幕上瑞安·雷诺兹 (Ryan Reynolds) 饰演的漫威讽刺反英雄联系在一起。然而，在美国西部各州，它有不同的含义。西方的大部分大型水库都是在 20 世纪通过截流河流而形成的。  

But these man-made lakes have shrunk over the past two decades as the rivers that feed them have dried up. When a reservoir is depleted to the point where water can no longer be sent downstream, it becomes a static, or dead, pool.  

但在过去二十年里，这些人工湖已经缩小，因为为它们提供水源的河流已经干涸。当水库枯竭到无法再向下游输送水的程度时，它就变成了静止的或死水的水池。  

In 2023 some reservoirs will move closer to this state. Lake Mead and Lake Powell—America’s two largest reservoirs, which straddle the Colorado river—have become dangerously dry.  

到 2023 年，一些水库将向这种状态靠拢。米德湖和鲍威尔湖——美国最大的两个水库，横跨科罗拉多河——已经变得干涸到危险的地步。  

Should Lake Powell hit dead pool, water supplies would dwindle for the 40m people across the south-west who depend on the Colorado River for water.  

如果鲍威尔湖遇上死水池，西南部依赖科罗拉多河取水的 4000 万人口的供水将会减少。

___

## Synfuels and e-fuels  

合成燃料和电子燃料

Synthetic fuels, also known as synfuels, are drop-in replacements for conventional hydrocarbon fuels (such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel), that are produced artificially rather than being made from oil. Electrofuels or e-fuels are synfuels made using renewable energy.  

合成燃料，也称为合成燃料，是传统碳氢化合物燃料（如汽油、柴油和喷气燃料）的直接替代品，它们是人工生产的，而不是从石油中提取的。电燃料或电子燃料是使用可再生能源制成的合成燃料。  

Solar or wind power is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis. The hydrogen is then combined with carbon dioxide, either taken from industrial processes or extracted from the atmosphere, to produce a hydrocarbon fuel.  

太阳能或风能用于通过电解将水分解为氢气和氧气。然后将氢气与从工业过程中提取或从大气中提取的二氧化碳结合，以生产碳氢化合物燃料。  

Depending on the process used, the resulting fuel can have a lower carbon footprint than conventional fuel, or be entirely carbon neutral.  

根据所使用的工艺，所得燃料的碳足迹可能比传统燃料低，或者完全是碳中性的。  

E-fuels make little sense for road vehicles (which can be easily electrified) but could power ships and planes by, in effect, repackaging renewable electricity as a liquid fuel.  

电子燃料对公路车辆（可以很容易地实现电气化）意义不大，但实际上可以通过将可再生电力重新包装为液体燃料来为船舶和飞机提供动力。

## Productivity paranoia  

生产力偏执狂

Does working from home make you more productive? In a survey by Microsoft of 20,000 workers in 11 countries, 87% thought they worked just as efficiently, or more efficiently, from home. But only 12% of bosses had full confidence that their teams were being productive.  

在家工作会让你更有效率吗？在 Microsoft 对 11 个国家/地区的 20,000 名员工进行的一项调查中，87% 的人认为他们在家工作的效率一样高，甚至更高。但只有 12% 的老板对他们的团队的工作效率充满信心。  

The result is “productivity paranoia”, both among workers (afraid of being seen as shirkers) and bosses (afraid that workers are shirking). It can, in turn, lead to displays of “productivity theatre” as workers strive to demonstrate they are pulling their weight.  

结果是“生产力偏执狂”，无论是在工人（害怕被视为偷懒者）还是老板（害怕工人在偷懒）中都是如此。反过来，当工人们努力证明他们正在竭尽全力时，它会导致“生产力剧场”的展示。

___

## TWaT city  

台湾城市

Fears early in the covid-19 pandemic that people would never return to offices were misplaced. But so were hopes that people’s working habits would eventually return to normal.  

在 covid-19 大流行初期，人们担心人们永远不会回到办公室是错误的。但人们的工作习惯最终会恢复正常的希望也是如此。  

Instead many workers have fallen into a pattern of travelling to the office only on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Cities are in denial about this trend, but in 2023 they will have to adapt to the “TWaTs”.  

相反，许多员工陷入了只在周二、周三和周四上班的模式。城市否认这一趋势，但到 2023 年，他们将不得不适应“TWaT”。  

Bars are packed on Thursday evenings as workers say farewell to each other; watering holes can adapt fairly easily by altering shift rotas. But offices will have to be more creative, either by reducing staffing or finding other uses for their spaces on quiet days.  

周四晚上，酒吧里挤满了工人们互相告别；通过改变轮班轮换，水坑可以很容易地适应。但是办公室必须更有创意，要么减少人员配置，要么在安静的日子里为他们的空间寻找其他用途。  

Public-transport operators will have to adjust, too. Instead of reducing services on Mondays and Fridays, they could try shifting demand by cutting prices on those days, and increasing them between Tuesday and Thursday.  

公共交通运营商也必须做出调整。他们可以尝试通过降低那些日子的价格并在周二和周四之间提高价格来转移需求，而不是在周一和周五减少服务。

## Doughnut effect  

甜甜圈效应

The pandemic-driven rise of working from home means that people prize proximity to offices less and domestic space more. Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University and Arjun Ramani, who is now a correspondent at _The Economist_, have identified a “doughnut effect” in large cities. As workers move away from city centres, suburban rental values have shot up, creating a ring of growth. This name relies on the fact that American doughnuts have holes in the middle.  

大流行病推动的在家工作的兴起意味着人们更看重靠近办公室的距离，而更看重家庭空间。斯坦福大学的 Nicholas Bloom 和现任《经济学人》记者的 Arjun Ramani 发现了大城市中的“甜甜圈效应”。随着工人离开市中心，郊区的租金价格飙升，形成了环状增长。这个名字依赖于美国甜甜圈中间有洞的事实。  

Commercial-property developers hope that people can be lured back to city centres by exceptional amenities such as beautiful offices and fantastic views. They envisage the British kind of doughnut which, instead of having a hole in the middle, is filled with jam.  

商业地产开发商希望人们可以通过漂亮的办公室和美妙的景色等卓越的便利设施吸引人们回到市中心。他们设想了英国式的甜甜圈，中间没有洞，而是装满了果酱。

## Battery Belt  

电池带

The Rust Belt is the name given to parts of America that have suffered from the decline of manufacturing since the 1950s.  

锈带是美国部分地区的名称，这些地区自 1950 年代以来一直遭受制造业的衰退。  

Now efforts are under way to revitalise these regions by promoting investment in new, green industries such as electric-car manufacturing and “gigafactories” that make automotive batteries. Ford is investing $50bn to expand production of electric vehicles, its rival GM is investing $35bn, and an estimated $40bn is going into new or expanded battery production in this new “Battery Belt”. Will the name catch on in 2023?  

现在，正在努力通过促进对电动汽车制造和制造汽车电池的“超级工厂”等新型绿色产业的投资来振兴这些地区。福特投资 500 亿美元扩大电动汽车的生产，其竞争对手通用汽车投资 350 亿美元，估计有 400 亿美元用于新“电池带”中的新电池生产或扩大电池生产。这个名字会在 2023 年流行起来吗？

___

## YIMBY

Whereas NIMBYs want nothing built in their backyards, YIMBYs say “yes” to development. Preferring high-density development to car-driven sprawl, they have been around for years, but have had limited success in altering planning rules. That will change in 2023.  

nimbys 不想在他们的后院建造任何东西，而 yimbys 对开发说“是”。他们更喜欢高密度开发而不是汽车驱动的蔓延，已经存在多年，但在改变规划规则方面取得的成功有限。这将在 2023 年改变。  

In July the Affordable Housing and High Road Jobs Act comes into effect in California. It will make it easier to build homes in areas currently dominated by offices, shops and car parks and will ease the rigid separation of living and working areas created by zoning laws.  

7 月，经济适用房和高速公路工作法案在加利福尼亚州生效。这将使在目前以办公室、商店和停车场为主的地区建造房屋变得更加容易，并将缓解分区法造成的生活区和工作区的严格分离。  

California is also watering down rules that force developers to provide so much parking space. Parking obligations will be weakened for new developments close to public transport, which should reduce construction costs and prices.  

加州也在淡化迫使开发商提供如此多停车位的规定。对于靠近公共交通的新开发项目，停车义务将被削弱，这应该会降低建设成本和价格。  

And where California leads, the rest of the world tends to follow eventually.  

在加州领先的地方，世界其他地区最终往往会效仿。

## Virtual power plant  

虚拟电厂

A growing number of homes and businesses have solar panels and batteries that can provide electricity to the property and can also deliver power to the electricity grid when needed.  

越来越多的家庭和企业拥有太阳能电池板和电池，可以为物业供电，也可以在需要时向电网供电。  

When used together in large numbers, and co-ordinated via internet commands, hundreds or thousands of these small-scale generation and storage systems can act in concert, functioning, in effect, as a virtual power plant that can be switched on and off at short notice.  

当大量一起使用并通过互联网命令进行协调时，成百上千个这些小型发电和存储系统可以协同工作，实际上就像一个可以随时打开和关闭的虚拟发电厂临时通知。  

Users must opt in to allow their equipment to be used in this way, and they are paid for the energy supplied.  

用户必须选择允许以这种方式使用他们的设备，并且他们会为所提供的能源付费。

Virtual power plants can eliminate the need for expensive, polluting “peaker plants” to maintain supply at peak times.  

虚拟发电厂可以消除对昂贵、污染严重的“峰值发电厂”的需求，以维持高峰时段的供应。  

They can also help electrical utilities with frequency regulation and voltage control, both of which must be managed carefully to balance supply and demand, particularly on electrical grids that rely heavily on intermittent sources such as solar and wind power.  

它们还可以帮助电力公司进行频率调节和电压控制，必须仔细管理这两者以平衡供需，特别是在严重依赖太阳能和风能等间歇性能源的电网中。  

Virtual power plants are an example of how “smart grids” can facilitate the shift towards renewable energy sources. They have been deployed in Australia, Britain, California and Germany.  

虚拟发电厂是“智能电网”如何促进向可再生能源转变的一个例子。它们已部署在澳大利亚、英国、加利福尼亚和德国。

## Vertiport  

垂直起降

Air taxis, also known as flying cars or eVTOL (electric, vertical takeoff and landing) air_craft_, are essentially multirotor drones that are large enough to carry people. Several firms around the world hope such vehicles will win regulatory approval in 2023 as a fast, sustainable form of urban transport. But eVTOLs can’t take off and land just anywhere. Instead, they will need designated places to do so—so-called vertiports—that are half-airport, half-subway station, and that allow eVTOLs to be integrated with existing transport networks, such as road and rail. All of this poses a new challenge to architects and urban designers, who are already coming up with some distinctive designs. Vertiports will be needed if evtols are to get off the ground.  

空中出租车，也称为飞行汽车或 evtol（电动、垂直起降）飞机，本质上是大到可以载人的多旋翼无人机。世界各地的几家公司希望此类车辆能够在 2023 年作为一种快速、可持续的城市交通方式获得监管部门的批准。但是 evtols 不能在任何地方起飞和降落。相反，他们将需要指定的地点来这样做——所谓的垂直起降场——即半机场、半地铁站，并允许 evtols 与现有的交通网络（如公路和铁路）相结合。所有这些都对建筑师和城市设计师提出了新的挑战，他们已经提出了一些与众不同的设计。如果要让 evtols 起步，将需要 Vertiports。

## Space solar power  

太空太阳能

The idea of capturing energy in space using huge solar arrays attached to orbiting satellites, and then beaming it down to Earth as microwaves, has been around since Isaac Asimov proposed it in a science-fiction story in 1941.  

自从艾萨克·阿西莫夫 (Isaac Asimov) 于 1941 年在科幻小说中提出这一想法以来，就一直存在使用附在轨道卫星上的巨大太阳能电池板在太空中捕获能量，然后将其作为微波发射到地球的想法。  

But the sums have never added up: launching things into space simply costs too much. That could change if launch costs fall far enough, or if new space-based manufacturing techniques emerge, such as mining asteroids for raw materials.  

但总和从来没有加起来：将东西发射到太空的成本太高了。如果发射成本下降得足够多，或者如果出现新的太空制造技术，比如在小行星上开采原材料，这种情况可能会改变。  

And in a high enough orbit, a solar-power satellite could stay in sunlight around the clock, providing a clean, reliable source of power. The European Space Agency sponsored a ground-based demonstration in Germany in 2022 as part of a proposed scheme called Solaris.  

在足够高的轨道上，太阳能卫星可以全天候待在阳光下，提供清洁、可靠的能源。作为名为 Solaris 的拟议计划的一部分，欧洲航天局于 2022 年在德国赞助了一次地面演示。  

America, Britain, China and Japan are also funding research in the field, which is experiencing a new dawn.  

美国、英国、中国和日本也在资助该领域的研究，该领域正在经历新的曙光。

## Cislunar  

地月

America intends to send astronauts to the Moon in the next few years, with the long-term goal of establishing a permanent base there.  

美国打算在未来几年内将宇航员送上月球，其长期目标是在那里建立一个永久性基地。  

As part of its Artemis programme it intends to put a space station, called the Lunar Gateway, in orbit around the Moon to act as a communications hub, science laboratory and short-term living space; it is due to launch in 2024.  

作为其 Artemis 计划的一部分，它打算在月球轨道上建立一个名为 Lunar Gateway 的空间站，作为通信枢纽、科学实验室和短期生活空间；它将于 2024 年发射。  

A series of preparatory robotic missions to the Moon will blast off in 2023. Things are hotting up in “cislunar” space—as the space between Earth and the orbit of the Moon is known.■  

一系列预备性机器人登月任务将于 2023 年启动。“地月”空间的情况正在升温——因为地球和月球轨道之间的空间是已知的。■
