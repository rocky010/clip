Despite being human-made, human-taught, and human-promoted, it’s easy to criticize AI for being fundamentally inhuman. To claim that AI models like ChatGPT and DALL-E will replace art created by people is to ignore both the ineffable qualities of the human touch and the critical flaws of these models—or so say the artists and writers.  

尽管人工智能是由人类制造的，由人类教授的，由人类推动的，但我们很容易批评人工智能从根本上说是不人道的。声称像ChatGPT和DALL-E这样的人工智能模型将取代由人创造的艺术，是忽视了人类触摸的不可言喻的品质和这些模型的关键缺陷--或者说艺术家和作家是这么说的。

They’re right that AI isn't quite at the stage of completely replacing human creativity—[it is](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/12/1064751/the-viral-ai-avatar-app-lensa-undressed-me-without-my-consent/) [biased](https://www.insider.com/chatgpt-is-like-many-other-ai-models-rife-with-bias-2023-1) [and](https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxnaem/stack-overflow-bans-chatgpt-for-constantly-giving-wrong-answers) [inaccurate](https://futurism.com/cnet-ai-errors), good at [bullshitting](https://clivethompson.medium.com/on-bullshit-and-ai-generated-prose-611a0f899c5) [without substance](https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922). It offers a simulacrum of desired output but [cannot be trusted](https://futurism.com/neoscope/magazine-mens-journal-errors-ai-health-article) on its own. But to home in on AI's failures underestimates the will of their developers to overcome them. And it overlooks the fact that these algorithms are able to mimic the creative process precisely because human creativity is, in many respects, just as algorithmic as the AI models that seek to outperform it.   

他们是对的，人工智能还没有达到完全取代人类创造力的阶段--它是有偏见的，不准确的，善于胡说八道，没有实质内容。它提供了一个理想产出的模拟，但不能相信它本身。但是，关注人工智能的失败是低估了其开发者克服这些失败的意愿。而且它忽略了这样一个事实，即这些算法之所以能够模仿创造过程，正是因为人类的创造力在许多方面与试图超越它的人工智能模型一样，都是通过算法实现的。

Writers and artists hone their craft by imitating, iterating, and integrating the work of others—further entrenching the archetypes and rhythms that humans and machines alike recognize as the trappings of art. Like AI models, we “predict” the best next word, brushstroke, camera angle, or musical note based on previously encountered work. We weigh our choices with accreted values and biases. We course-correct using feedback on proximity to desired effect. And with every iteration of this process, our ability to more precisely execute creative prompts improves. The presumed appeal of AI models is that they can do this at scale and on demand, drawing from a massive corpus of samples and feedback.  

作家和艺术家通过模仿、迭代和整合他人的作品来磨练自己的技艺--进一步巩固了人类和机器都认可的艺术的原型和节奏。像人工智能模型一样，我们根据以前遇到的作品，"预测 "下一个最好的词、笔触、摄影角度或音符。我们用累积的价值和偏见来衡量我们的选择。我们利用对预期效果的接近程度的反馈来纠正方向。随着这个过程的每一次迭代，我们更精确地执行创意提示的能力得到了提高。人工智能模型的假定吸引力在于，它们可以根据需求大规模地做到这一点，并从大量的样本和反馈中汲取养分。

Whether an AI model will one day create a masterpiece, achieve true indistinguishability, or become a literal _deus ex machina_ is a moot point. At face value, both humans and machines create some form of art.  

人工智能模型是否有一天会创造出杰作，实现真正的无差别性，或者成为一个字面意义上的机器，这是一个没有意义的问题。从表面上看，人类和机器都创造了某种形式的艺术。

But these questions over capability distract from the issues that technologies raise with every advance: If the end results are equivalent, do we value the object over the person making it? Or in this case, do we value the artist in all their messy humanity? And what does the desire to strip away that humanity reveal about the perceived purpose of art and creation being sold to us?  

但这些关于能力的问题分散了人们对技术每一次进步都会引发的问题的注意力。如果最终的结果是相同的，我们是否重视物体而不是制造它的人？或者在这种情况下，我们是否重视艺术家的所有混乱的人性？剥离这种人性的愿望揭示了被卖给我们的艺术和创作的感知目的是什么？

Certain online communities are already exposing the duplicative qualities of art by using pattern-finding as a creative medium—namely, via “web weaving.” Also known as comparatives, web weaving is a genre of Tumblr post that juxtaposes excerpts and images around a central theme. Interspersed among Kafka passages, Richard Siken verses, Renaissance paintings, street photography, and Mitski lyrics are screenshots of TikToks, tweets, and film stills. These collections of digital ephemera often cohere around motifs of yearning, alienation, and intimacy—pervasive moods of online life.  

某些网络社区已经通过使用模式搜索作为一种创造性的媒介，即通过 "网络编织"，揭露了艺术的重复性。网络编织也被称为比较法，是Tumblr帖子的一种类型，围绕一个中心主题，将摘录和图片并列。在卡夫卡的段落、理查德-西肯的诗句、文艺复兴时期的绘画、街头摄影和米茨基的歌词中，穿插着TikToks的截图、推特和电影剧照。这些数字碎片的集合往往围绕着渴望、疏远和亲密的主题--网络生活中普遍存在的情绪。

One post by Tumblr user [@ohevoyev](https://archive.md/24PHF) is dedicated to the Minotaur of Greek myth, joining Borges' short story with paintings, stanzas, and a screenshot of a conversation encapsulating the through line: “the cruelty of being a cursed child” whose parents “use the curse to lose love for you.” Another has [multiple users](https://archive.md/JHtmt) contributing multimedia excerpts in an extended meditation on homesickness. Web weaving is the social media user's collage: The canvas of the post holds together artful arrangements of online curios and gems, finding order across a sea of content.  

Tumblr用户 [@ohevoyev](https://archive.md/24PHF) 的一篇帖子专门介绍了希腊神话中的弥诺陶洛斯，将博尔赫斯的短篇小说与绘画、诗句以及囊括贯穿始终的对话的截图结合起来。"作为一个被诅咒的孩子的残酷性"，其父母 "利用诅咒来失去对你的爱"。另一个是多个用户在一个关于思乡的扩展冥想中贡献多媒体摘录。网络编织是社交媒体用户的拼贴画。帖子的画布将网上的奇珍异宝艺术性地排列在一起，在内容的海洋中寻找秩序。

Another form of web weaving—fanvids, or video edits—splices together media clips to highlight thematic through lines. One [popular fanvid](https://archive.md/X0o5t) by Twitter user @loveforcaptnswn melds sequences from 31 shows and 34 films that aired in 2022—characters walk through battlefields and gaze across burning wastelands literal and figurative, hold one another in violent and tender embrace. Each visual motif seamlessly transitions from one story to the next, interchangeable characters and immaterial backdrops swapping places like a glitch in the matrix.  

另一种网络编织形式--粉丝视频，或视频编辑--将媒体片段剪辑在一起，以突出主题的贯穿性。推特用户@loveforcaptnswn的一个流行的粉丝视频融合了2022年播出的31部节目和34部电影的片段--人物走过战场，凝视燃烧的荒地，在暴力和温柔的怀抱中彼此相拥。每个视觉主题都从一个故事无缝过渡到下一个故事，可替换的人物和非物质背景像矩阵中的一个故障一样交换了位置。

As web weaving shows, art that strikes a chord doesn't necessarily do something new so much as it reconfigures the enduring in novel contexts. Repetition is a cornerstone of art and writing—reduced to its most elemental form, all art asks variations of the same fundamental questions.  

正如网络编织所显示的那样，引起共鸣的艺术不一定做什么新的事情，而是在新的背景下重新配置持久的东西。重复是艺术和写作的基石--还原到其最基本的形式，所有的艺术都提出了相同的基本问题的变化。

It’s why works can be organized by genre and subgenre; academics can propose [grand unified theories](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-man-behind-the-myth-should-we-question-the-heros-journey/) of literature; folklorists can [systematically classify](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/folk_and_myth/indices) thousands of recurring motifs in myths, legends, and fables around the world; and friends and algorithms can curate playlists of songs and stories just for you. And when repetition tends toward the formulaic, it’s also why AI can be used by Hollywood to [“predict” a film’s performance](https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/1/29/21058521/hollywood-ai-deepfake-black-mirror-gemini-irishman-cinelytic) based on its screenplay, by writers to [churn out novels](https://www.theverge.com/23520625/chatgpt-openai-amazon-kindle-novel), and by researchers to [manifest scientific papers](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adg7879).  

这就是为什么作品可以按流派和次流派组织起来；学术界可以提出宏大的统一文学理论；民俗学家可以系统地对世界各地的神话、传说和寓言中成千上万的重复性主题进行分类；朋友和算法可以为你策划歌曲和故事的播放列表。当重复趋向于公式化时，这也是为什么人工智能可以被好莱坞用来根据剧本 "预测 "一部电影的表现，被作家用来编写小说，被研究人员用来发表科学论文。

But repetition isn’t automatically inferior for being predictable. Predictability allows artists to create something different via subversion. What if the Minotaur were not the monster but the victim? And what if Theseus came bearing not a sword of just retribution but of tragic deliverance? In taking the same trope a few steps to the left, inverting or casting it in light or shadow, the well-worn becomes scaffolding for a previously unheard perspective or yet unimagined possibility.  

但重复并不因为可预测而自动低劣。可预测性允许艺术家通过颠覆创造不同的东西。如果弥诺陶洛斯不是怪物而是受害者呢？如果特修斯不是带着复仇之剑而是带着悲剧性的解救之剑呢？在把同样的套路向左走几步，颠倒或用光或影投射它的时候，老掉牙的套路就成了以前没有听说过的观点或尚未想象的可能性的支架。

But focusing exclusively on the similarities between works loses sight of their differences, erasing the context that grants each their unique purpose and function. And it undermines the gravity of making a deliberate choice to break the pattern, leaving it all up to chance for the sake of expediency. We’ve all heard this story before, and we could stand to hear it again. The hunger for a version that honors individual needs with intentionality won’t be sated with infinite variants you can’t truly call your own.  

但是，只关注作品之间的相似性，就会忽视它们的差异，抹去赋予每件作品独特目的和功能的背景。而且它破坏了刻意选择打破模式的严重性，为了权宜之计而把一切都留给了机会。我们以前都听过这个故事，我们可以再听一次。对一个以故意尊重个人需求的版本的渴望，不会因为你不能真正称之为自己的无限变种而得到满足。

What if repetition and predictability themselves _give_ art its meaning and significance? The algorithmic qualities of creativity can be an asset rather than a redundancy. And no other community is as [proudly and enthusiastically](https://archive.md/M1br1) well versed in drawing parallels and iterating for the billionth time on the same tropes as fandom.  

如果重复性和可预测性本身赋予艺术以意义和重要性呢？创造性的算法品质可以成为一种资产，而不是一种多余的东西。没有其他社区能像粉丝团那样，自豪而热情地精通于在相同的套路上进行相似和迭代十亿次。

An abundance of fan works circle around the same [plot devices](https://tvtropes.org/), [narrative alternatives](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Alternate_Universe), and [character archetypes](https://archive.md/o62iV). Fans have set up characters from various media properties in [over 33,500 coffee shop meet-cutes](https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Alternate%20Universe%20-%20Coffee%20Shops%20*a*%20Caf%C3%A9s/works) to date. And some find the hundredth read about a character waking up to a loved one waiting beside their hospital bed [no less emotionally potent](https://archive.md/C4l1i) than the first.  

大量的粉丝作品都围绕着相同的情节装置、叙事方式和人物原型展开。迄今为止，粉丝们已经在超过33,500个咖啡馆中设置了来自不同媒体的角色。有些人发现，当一个角色在医院的病床旁醒来时，他所爱的人正在等待他，而这一读就是100次，其情感的强烈程度不亚于第一次。

The predictable and repetitive nature of these fan works don't detract from their appeal to other fans—in fact, it's through these very qualities that they become meaningful. Recursion is what sustains fan communities. In passing down the same hallowed tropes through art created for the pleasure of creation and connection, a shared love for a story becomes a common language spoken via iteration.  

这些粉丝作品的可预测性和重复性并不影响它们对其他粉丝的吸引力--事实上，正是通过这些品质，它们变得有意义。重复性是维持粉丝群体的原因。在通过为创造和联系的乐趣而创造的艺术来传承相同的神圣的陈词滥调时，对一个故事的共同热爱成为通过迭代而说出的共同语言。

In conversation with cultural critic Hanif Abdurraqib, the musician L'Rain describes how she dealt with her discomfort over her voice by looping it, finding [transformation through repetition](https://radio.sonos.com/shows/l-rain-transformation-through-repetition). In response, Abdurraqib noted that repeatedly listening to the same sound turns it into noise, as “repetition allows the clear to become joyously indecipherable.” Interpreted in this way, repetition doesn't render something meaningless but distills it into pure essence—smoothing the [stutter of the individual](https://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2015/01/20/collecting-alvin-luciers-i-am-sitting-in-a-room/) until all that remains is the medium itself. Machine learning capitalizes on the fact that a trope repeated ad infinitum will so congeal in meaning that authorial source is made superfluous.  

在与文化评论家Hanif Abdurraqib的对话中，音乐家L'Rain描述了她如何通过循环处理她的声音的不适感，通过重复找到转变。作为回应，Abdurraqib指出，反复听同一个声音会把它变成噪音，因为 "重复让清晰的东西变得快乐地难以辨认"。以这种方式解释，重复不会使某些东西变得毫无意义，而是将其提炼成纯粹的本质--磨平个人的结巴，直到剩下的只是媒介本身。机器学习利用了这样一个事实，即一个特例无限次地重复，其意义会如此凝固，以至于作者的来源变得多余了。

That doesn't mean the author's presence is no longer felt. A common critique of literary and media analysis is that “[the curtains are blue](https://imgur.com/gallery/QWGrU)” because they just happened to be blue—the author did not intentionally ascribe significance to it. But as Tumblr user [@seravph](https://archive.md/wip/sQimN) noted, the curtains are blue not as a manufactured symbol for sadness, but because the author's mother died in a room with blue curtains, and every story they've written since then bears that mark. In other words, it's not a contrivance, but a haunting—an image bleeding with memory. Biographical knowledge isn't necessarily required to perceive its significance; it's enough to treat the work as something that bears the weight and warmth of another's life. Every trope is made unique when run through the sieve of the individual.  

这并不意味着作者的存在不再被感受到。对文学和媒体分析的一个常见批评是，"窗帘是蓝色的"，因为它们刚好是蓝色的--作者并没有故意赋予它意义。但正如Tumblr用户 [@seravph](https://archive.md/wip/sQimN) 所指出的，窗帘是蓝色的，不是作为一种制造的悲伤的象征，而是因为作者的母亲死在一个有蓝色窗帘的房间里，从那以后他们写的每一个故事都有这个标记。换句话说，这不是一种设计，而是一种萦绕在记忆中的形象。感知其意义不一定需要传记知识；把作品当作承载着他人生命的重量和温度的东西就足够了。每一个套路在通过个人的筛子时都会变得独特。

If AI embodies _l'art pour l'art_, generating products disassociated from social function and cultural history, then fandom at its best is a celebration of the people behind the art—where the labor of creation is recognized and revered. An AI model [could replicate](https://netflixtechblog.com/match-cutting-at-netflix-finding-cuts-with-smooth-visual-transitions-31c3fc14ae59) @loveforcaptnswn's 2022 fanvid, showcasing an even vaster panoply of media. But the experience of watching it is colored by the fact that it was hand-woven by one person as an expression of love and gratitude for her friends.   

如果说人工智能体现了为艺术而艺术，产生了与社会功能和文化历史无关的产品，那么最好的粉丝就是对艺术背后的人的庆祝--在这里，创作的劳动被认可和尊重。人工智能模型可以复制@loveforcaptnswn的2022年粉丝视频，展示更广泛的媒体范围。但观看这段视频的体验是有色彩的，因为它是由一个人手工编织的，是对她的朋友的爱和感激的表达。

Repetition and predictability are not what devalues art. Rather, what devalues art is the negation of the artist and community that imbue a work with significance beyond its mere existence. The value of art is what we give it—no object has inherent worth. Indistinguishable or not, to claim equivalency between AI- and human-made works is to reject what makes them worth anything more than their exchange value. And to privilege the object over the person puts to question whether these tools are as humanity-serving as their designers claim them to be.  

重复和可预测性并不是使艺术贬值的原因。相反，使艺术贬值的是对艺术家和社区的否定，这使一件作品具有超越其存在的意义。艺术的价值是我们赋予它的--没有任何物体具有固有的价值。无论是否有区别，声称人工智能和人类制造的作品之间的等价性，就是拒绝让它们的价值超过其交换价值的东西。而将物体置于人之上的做法，使人怀疑这些工具是否像它们的设计者所说的那样为人类服务。

In its repetitive qualities, art lends itself to being conceptualized as an assembly line of interchangeable parts that can be cannibalized at will. So it is that the process of creating art is often described in terms of theft and imitation—“good artists copy, great artists steal,” or so the supposed Picasso quote goes. AI users justify their means of production by claiming that all artwork is derivative: If nothing is original, why couldn't they draw inspiration from another's work? [Some argue](https://archive.md/vgY8g) that AI art is ethical and morally permissible because it isn't considered theft under current legal definitions.  

由于其重复性，艺术可以被概念化为一条由可互换的部件组成的流水线，可以随意拆解。因此，创造艺术的过程经常被描述为偷窃和模仿--"好的艺术家复制，伟大的艺术家偷窃"，或者所谓的毕加索语录就是这样。人工智能用户通过声称所有的艺术品都是衍生品来为他们的生产方式辩护。如果没有什么是原创的，为什么他们不能从别人的作品中获取灵感？有些人认为，人工智能艺术在伦理上和道德上是允许的，因为根据目前的法律定义，它不被视为盗窃。

But drawing inspiration manifests in varying degrees, some toeing far closer to plagiarism than others. There's a difference between transforming a trope into something new and duplicating someone else's iteration and calling it unique. There's a difference between imitating someone’s style for practice or in homage and copying it to pass off as your own. And there's a difference between sampling components of someone's work with their acknowledgement and wholesale appropriation without due credit.   

但汲取灵感的表现程度各不相同，有些远远接近于剽窃。将一个套路转化为新的东西与复制别人的迭代并称其为独特的东西是有区别的。为了练习或致敬而模仿别人的风格与把它复制为自己的风格是有区别的。在承认某人作品的组成部分的情况下对其进行采样，与在没有适当信用的情况下对其进行全盘挪用，两者之间是有区别的。

In July 2022, outcry regarding a painting of a [Black cowboy](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/black-cowboy-guggenheim-bilbao-plagiarism-2146338) by artist Gala Knörr brought attention to its similarity to an uncredited film still by the artist dayday. Knörr [eventually apologized](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/guggenheim-gala-knorr-dayday-1381950/), stating that her work is “based on many images and media” and her excluding credit was “not ill-intentioned.” The Guggenheim Bilbao ultimately exhibited the pieces side by side, showing and linking the source of inspiration to, ironically, foster reflection on Black erasure.  

2022年7月，艺术家Gala Knör的一幅黑人牛仔画引起了人们的注意，因为它与艺术家dayday的一张未署名的电影剧照相似。克诺尔最终道歉，表示她的作品是 "基于许多图像和媒体"，她排除信用 "并非居心叵测"。毕尔巴鄂古根海姆美术馆最终将这两件作品并排展出，展示并联系了灵感来源，讽刺地促进了对黑人被抹杀的反思。

All artists base their work on many sources—it's why many can rattle off a list of their influences and inspirations on command. Far from diminishing, identifying these echoes enriches an oeuvre by putting it in conversation with the creative genealogy that made it possible. Imitation is how we learn to create, and incorporation is how we learn to create well. The central issue plagiarism raises isn't a philosophical question about what constitutes originality or gatekeeping—it's whether we value the people behind a source of inspiration, without which all other works based upon it would not exist. Nor does the legality of an act mean it's ethical—it only makes plain what those in power deem worthy of protection.  

所有艺术家的作品都基于许多来源--这就是为什么许多人可以随口说出他们的影响和灵感的清单。识别这些回声远非削弱，而是通过将其与使其成为可能的创作谱系进行对话，丰富了作品的内容。模仿是我们学习创造的方式，而吸收是我们学习创造的方式。抄袭引起的核心问题并不是关于什么是原创性或把关的哲学问题--而是我们是否重视灵感来源背后的人，如果没有他们，所有基于他们的其他作品就不会存在。一种行为的合法性也不意味着它是道德的--它只表明那些当权者认为值得保护的东西。

Some AI users express reservations about crediting their sources. One Reddit user based a custom model on artist [Deb JJ Lee](https://archive.ph/sVFUM)'s work but named it after animation studio Kurzgesagt because they “didn't know what to call it.” The account was deleted after Lee discovered their art was used without permission or acknowledgement.  

一些人工智能用户对归功于他们的来源表示保留。一个Reddit用户根据艺术家Deb JJ Lee的作品制作了一个自定义模型，但以动画工作室Kurzgesagt命名，因为他们 "不知道该怎么称呼它"。在李发现他们的艺术作品在未经许可或确认的情况下被使用后，该账户被删除。

By obfuscating sources, users render transparent the mode of engagement AI inherently advances: one founded on mass consumption, where quantity itself is quality. Where intent is obsolete, because the end product justifies the means. Where credit is deprecated, because everyone is an interchangeable part. Where collaboration is eliminated, because the act of creation is estranged into a black box. Where the profession of artist is obviated—save for the [elect few](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/wealth-strong-predictor-whether-individual-pursues-creative-profession-180972072/)—because the product is ultimately privileged over the person.  

通过混淆来源，用户使人工智能固有的参与模式变得透明：一种建立在大众消费基础上的模式，数量本身就是质量。在那里，意图是过时的，因为最终产品证明了手段的合理性。在那里，信用被废除，因为每个人都是可替换的部分。在那里，合作被消除了，因为创作行为被疏远到一个黑盒子里。在那里，艺术家的职业被取消了--除了少数被选中的人--因为产品最终被赋予了人的特权。

A fair number of stories on AI and the future of creativity end with the author describing or transcribing their experience with a model. Often this is done with an air of morbid curiosity, wary apprehension, or dismissive ridicule—expressing both unease and self-reassurance over the future of their profession.  

有相当数量的关于人工智能和未来创造力的故事以作者描述或转录他们对模型的体验结束。这通常是以一种病态的好奇心、警惕的忧虑或轻蔑的嘲笑来完成的--对他们职业的未来表达了不安和自我保证。

But why give the algorithm any more space than it already has? Why not give credit where credit is due?  

但为什么要给这个算法更多的空间呢？为什么不把功劳归功于人呢？

This essay is itself a form of web weaving, composed of threads both self-evident and subsumed. Hidden within its warp and weft lie, among others: an elementary school teacher's basic essay structure; Yuan and Yu's _Can't Help Myself_; Dafen Village; a high school teacher's lesson on strategic paragraph breaks; Benjamin’s aura; Lil Nas X avenging Mr. Van Gogh; a friend's long memory; Gaiman's _The Sandman_; Deleuze's multiplicity; an author who writes fanfic at 3 am; an editor’s deft eye; Carson's conception of eros; Weil's notion of love; years of thoughts and experiences tangential, parallel, and asymptotic to this subject.  

这篇论文本身就是一种织网的形式，由不言而喻和归纳的线组成。在它的经线和纬线中隐藏着：一个小学老师的基本作文结构；袁、余的《情不自禁》；大芬村；一个高中老师关于战略性断段的课程；本雅明的光环；Lil Nas X为Mr.梵高；一个朋友的漫长记忆；盖曼的《睡魔》；德勒兹的多重性；一个在凌晨三点写粉丝小说的作者；一个编辑的灵巧眼光；卡森的情欲概念；韦尔的爱的概念；多年来对这个主题的切入、平行和渐近的思考和经验。

I drew from a trove of sources far smaller than what an algorithm has access to, and I took far longer than what an algorithm would require to compose an essay of this length. But I carry forward those who taught and inspire me, transforming and consciously honoring their contributions. As US poet laureate [Ada Limón noted](https://www.slowdownshow.org/episode/2023/01/09/encore-643-eventually-one-point-where-we-arrive), everything has been said before and better than you can—but despite and because of the weight of all that preceded you, your vision will be “tugged beautifully out of the collective past and into the singular present.”  

我从一个远远小于算法所能接触到的资料库中汲取营养，我花费的时间也远远超过算法所需的时间来撰写如此长的文章。但我发扬了那些教导和启发我的人，改造并有意识地尊重他们的贡献。正如美国桂冠诗人阿达-利蒙所指出的，一切都在你之前说过，而且比你说得更好，但尽管如此，也因为你之前所有的重量，你的视野将 "从集体的过去中漂亮地拉出来，进入单一的现在。"

Creating good art is a time-consuming, inherently repetitive, often taxing, and sometimes costly process. It's frustrating to have a brilliant idea and be unable to execute it exactly as you imagined, if at all. Craft takes years to master, and even the most vaunted of artists can struggle to wield a medium to the specifications they desire. It's just part of being human.  

创作好的艺术是一个耗时的、固有的重复性的、经常是费力的、有时是昂贵的过程。如果有一个绝妙的想法，却不能完全按照你的想象来执行，这是很令人沮丧的。手工艺需要多年的时间来掌握，即使是最有名望的艺术家也会努力按照他们所希望的规格来挥舞媒介。这只是做人的一部分。

But artists make art because there is pleasure in chasing an idea that may never be exactly realized. There is joy in parsing the raw materials at your disposal to make something worthwhile. There is love in creating an homage with every work you make. When you strip away the filters of profit, power, and prestige, all that's left is something you've dreamed of bringing into existence, and the time, effort, and care you've dedicated to carving it free with your own weathered hands. In the end, as artist [Jackie Liu wrote](https://archive.ph/yhPQc), what else is it all for?  

但是，艺术家们创造艺术，因为在追逐一个可能永远不会完全实现的想法时，会有乐趣。在分析你所掌握的原材料以做出有价值的东西时，是一种快乐。在你所做的每一件作品中创造出一种敬意，这是一种爱。当你剥去利润、权力和声望的过滤器时，剩下的就是你梦寐以求的东西，以及你为用自己饱经风霜的双手自由雕刻它而付出的时间、努力和关怀。最后，正如艺术家Jackie Liu所写的，这一切还有什么意义？

Everyone has the capacity for mastery in art—given the time and resources to practice. So why give it all up to a machine? Why not give people the means to own the efforts of their own creation?  

每个人都有掌握艺术的能力--只要有时间和资源来练习。那么，为什么要把这一切交给一台机器呢？为什么不给人们以拥有自己创造的努力的手段？

Why not save the pleasure of reaching towards that elusive masterpiece for yourself?  

为什么不为自己保留伸向那难以捉摸的杰作的乐趣？
