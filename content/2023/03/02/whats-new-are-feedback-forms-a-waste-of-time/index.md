Do people actually use feedback forms to provide meaningful feedback? Are there better ways to solicit or accept feedback?  

人们真的使用反馈表来提供有意义的反馈吗？是否有更好的方法来征求或接受反馈？

I'd love to know the opinions of other founders!  

我很想知道其他创始人的意见！

### Design time  

设计时间

[EzMail](https://www.indiehackers.com/EzMail_AI/history) says that it all comes down to design:  

EzMail 说这一切都归结为设计：

Feedback forms can be a valuable tool for gathering information and insights from customers, employees, or other stakeholders. Whether or not they are a waste of time depends on how they are designed and implemented.  

反馈表可以成为从客户、员工或其他利益相关者那里收集信息和见解的宝贵工具。它们是否浪费时间取决于它们的设计和实施方式。

If feedback forms are poorly designed, difficult to use, or don't provide meaningful insights, they can be a waste of time for both the people filling them out, and the organization collecting the feedback.  

如果反馈表设计不当、难以使用或不能提供有意义的见解，那么对于填写表格的人和收集反馈的组织来说都是浪费时间。  

In some cases, feedback forms can even be counterproductive, as they may create frustration or disengagement among those asked to provide feedback.  

在某些情况下，反馈表甚至可能适得其反，因为它们可能会让被要求提供反馈的人感到沮丧或疏远。

On the other hand, well-designed feedback forms can provide valuable insights that can inform decision-making, improve products or services, or help identify areas for improvement.  

另一方面，设计良好的反馈表可以提供有价值的见解，可以为决策提供信息、改进产品或服务，或帮助确定需要改进的领域。  

They can also help organizations demonstrate that they are listening to their customers or employees, and are committed to continuous improvement.  

他们还可以帮助组织证明他们正在倾听客户或员工的意见，并致力于持续改进。

To make feedback forms effective, they should be designed with the following principles in mind:  

为了使反馈表有效，设计时应牢记以下原则：

-   Keep them short and easy to use: Long, complicated feedback forms are less likely to be completed, and may frustrate or turn off participants.  
    
    保持简短且易于使用：冗长、复杂的反馈表不太可能完成，并且可能会使参与者感到沮丧或失去兴趣。
    
-   Ask specific, relevant questions: Feedback forms should ask questions that are specific and relevant to the purpose of the form. Avoid asking questions that are irrelevant or unclear.  
    
    提出具体的相关问题：反馈表应该提出与表格目的相关的具体问题。避免问不相关或不清楚的问题。
    
-   Provide clear instructions: Make sure that participants understand what they are being asked to do, and provide clear instructions on how to complete the feedback form.  
    
    提供明确的说明：确保参与者了解要求他们做什么，并就如何填写反馈表提供明确的说明。
    
-   Use a mix of question types: Feedback forms can use a variety of question types, including open-ended, multiple choice, and [Likert scale](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/likert-scale/#:~:text=So%20what%20is%20a%20Likert,neutral%20option%20in%20its%20scale.) questions. Different question types can help to gather different types of feedback.  
    
    使用混合的问题类型：反馈表可以使用多种问题类型，包括开放式、多项选择和李克特量表问题。不同的问题类型可以帮助收集不同类型的反馈。
    
-   Provide incentives: To encourage participation, consider providing incentives. A prize drawing, a discount on a future purchase, or access to exclusive content are all great examples.  
    
    提供奖励：为鼓励参与，考虑提供奖励。抽奖、未来购买的折扣或访问独家内容都是很好的例子。
    

Overall, feedback forms can be a useful tool for gathering insights and feedback!  

总的来说，反馈表可以成为收集见解和反馈的有用工具！

### Easy peasy  

十分简单

[Max Schubert](https://www.indiehackers.com/max_linus/history) has learned more from interviews than from feedback forms:  

Max Schubert 从访谈中学到的东西比从反馈表中学到的更多：

However, I always try to make it easy for users to give feedback. In general, multiple choice questions worked much better than free text. Here are some questions to get you started:  

但是，我总是尽量让用户更容易提供反馈。一般来说，多项选择题比自由文本更有效。以下是一些帮助您入门的问题：

-   Why did you sign up? (Give a list of choices, and include "other.")  
    
    你为什么报名？ （给出一个选项列表，并包括“其他”。）
-   How likely are you to recommend our product or service to a friend or colleague? (1-10, then include a follow-up question based on the given score.)  
    
    您向朋友或同事推荐我们的产品或服务的可能性有多大？ （1-10，然后根据给定的分数包括一个后续问题。）
-   Which feature is least important to you? (Give a list of choices.)  
    
    哪个功能对您来说最不重要？ （给出一个选项列表。）

[Sachin G. Kulkarni](https://www.indiehackers.com/sachingk) agrees:  

Sachin G. Kulkarni 同意：

You always want to hear from your customers. Make it as easy as possible for customers to send their thoughts, along with the proper context.  

您总是想听取客户的意见。让客户尽可能轻松地发送他们的想法以及适当的上下文。

Even if you don't actually get valuable input from your customers, it's preferable to have customers make the effort to send you their thoughts than not hearing anything from them.  

即使您实际上没有从客户那里得到有价值的意见，让客户努力向您发送他们的想法也比什么都听不到要好。

### Temper your expectations  

缓和你的期望

[Evan](https://www.indiehackers.com/Thewebuiguy/history) says that it depends:  

埃文说这取决于：

We always use feedback forms when launching a new product, and they have caught a bug or two. They've also told us if our assumptions about the UX were correct, or if we need to change them. It can give you an idea of what has to be done in order to bring your customer ratings up.  

我们在推出新产品时总是使用反馈表，他们发现了一两个错误。他们还告诉我们我们对用户体验的假设是否正确，或者我们是否需要更改它们。它可以让您了解必须做什么才能提高客户评级。  

Where it starts to lose its value is if you're bombarding your customers with feedback requests. For instance, if you have six or seven live features, and each has its own feedback form, you're going to need some sort of governance so you don't ruin the user's experience.  

它开始失去价值的地方是，如果你用反馈请求轰炸你的客户。例如，如果您有六到七个实时功能，并且每个功能都有自己的反馈表，那么您将需要某种治理，以免破坏用户体验。  

I've found that having a targeted timeframe and set of feedback requests works best.  

我发现有一个有针对性的时间框架和一组反馈请求效果最好。

If used properly, feedback forms are a great way to judge how customers see and use your product. Just don't go into it expecting amazing data from every single customer!  

如果使用得当，反馈表是判断客户如何看待和使用您的产品的好方法。只是不要期望每个客户都能获得惊人的数据！
