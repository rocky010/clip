## Some quick thoughts after blowing up a bit on Hackernews  

在 Hackernews 上引起轰动后的一些快速想法

-   Good jobs definitely exist, though the average job in tech is as I've described below. I think more than half (maybe 90%) of jobs produce nothing, but I can't possibly know that.  
    
    好工作肯定存在，尽管技术领域的平均工作就像我在下面描述的那样。我认为超过一半（可能是 90%）的工作什么都不产生，但我不可能知道这一点。  
    
    The real issue is that, if you're trying one job a year, it would take a long time to find something that creates basic worth (ignoring the other things needed for happy work). Lower chances of success mean you need the opportunity to roll the die many times!  
    
    真正的问题是，如果你一年只尝试一份工作，那么你会花很长时间才能找到能创造基本价值的东西（忽略快乐工作所需的其他东西）。较低的成功机会意味着您需要多次掷骰子的机会！
-   Working in 'profit centres', which Patrick McKenzie introduced me to in his writing, seems like the best way to achieve value production, if not deep existential meaning. Baby steps  
    
    在帕特里克·麦肯齐 (Patrick McKenzie) 的著作中向我介绍的“利润中心”工作，即使没有深刻的存在意义，似乎也是实现价值生产的最佳方式。婴儿学步
-   If you can afford to, ditch these jobs ASAP because, if the writing below resonates with you it will slowly corrode your soul  
    
    如果你负担得起，尽快放弃这些工作，因为如果下面的文字引起你的共鸣，它会慢慢腐蚀你的灵魂
-   It isn't just data work, people across the spectrum of I.T said most of their work was "worthless".  
    
    不仅仅是数据工作，IT 领域的人们都说他们的大部分工作“毫无价值”。  
    
    The funny thing is that David Graeber defined bullshit jobs as jobs were "even the employee cannot justify its existence", so I guess that many of these fit the definition of bullshit jobs pretty easily  
    
    有趣的是，David Graeber 将 bullshit jobs 定义为“即使员工也无法证明其存在”的工作，所以我猜其中许多很容易符合 bullshit jobs 的定义
-   One guy pointed out how comfortable this work seemed, how high the pay was, and said I am out-of-touch and privileged. To that I say, yes, this is a first-world problem, _obviously_.  
    
    一个人指出这份工作看起来多么舒服，薪水多么高，并说我与世隔绝，享有特权。对此我说，是的，这显然是第一世界的问题。

## The article  

文章

There is a flavor of despair I've become accustomed to, so deeply ingrained in the hearts of myself and my colleagues that it has settled into a hopeless passivity. It's the despair that comes from knowing that we spend most of our time producing nothing of value.  

有一种绝望的味道我已经习以为常，它在我自己和我的同事们的心中根深蒂固，以至于陷入一种无望的消极状态。这是因为知道我们大部分时间都没有产生任何有价值的东西而产生的绝望。

It is something we admit to quietly, sometimes laughingly, because we know it could be much worse. For the most part, we all work in the data space at large organisations, either in the public sector or adjacent to it. It is an incredibly comfortable living.  

这是我们悄悄承认的事情，有时甚至是笑着承认，因为我们知道情况可能会更糟。在大多数情况下，我们都在大型组织的数据空间中工作，无论是在公共部门还是与其相邻。这是一种令人难以置信的舒适生活。  

The pressure is non-existent, we clock out at 5PM, and there are certainly fates far worse than that. But still, we despair.  

压力是不存在的，我们下午 5 点下班，当然还有比这更糟糕的命运。但是，我们仍然感到绝望。

I remember my first job, fresh out of university, where I was paid _just_ enough to say that I was earning six figures, which is a heady experience for a young man from a developing country. At the time, I felt like quite the hotshot, and had a title to back that up - 'data scientist'.  

我记得我的第一份工作，刚从大学毕业，那里的薪水刚好可以说我的收入是六位数，这对于来自发展中国家的年轻人来说是一种令人兴奋的经历。当时，我觉得自己很风流，而且有一个头衔来支持这一点——“数据科学家”。

What did such a position entail? I spent about two years in that role and produced absolutely nothing of value to society, and more strangely, nothing of value to the organisation I was in.  

这样的职位意味着什么？我在那个职位上花了大约两年时间，但对社会没有任何价值，更奇怪的是，对我所在的组织也没有任何价值。  

I largely produced PowerBI dashboards from awful data sources that I knew no one was looking at - the same people who sent the emails tagged 'URGENT!' and demanded a product ASAP were seemingly unaware that we could view whether anyone actually looked at the work we produced.  

我主要从可怕的数据源生成 PowerBI 仪表板，我知道没有人在看这些数据源——发送标记为“紧急！”的电子邮件的同一个人。并要求尽快提供产品似乎没有意识到我们可以查看是否有人真正看过我们制作的作品。  

Sometimes we would have huge errors in the work due to the horrific undocumented database we drew from, and no one would ever notice.  

有时，由于我们从可怕的未记录的数据库中提取数据，我们会在工作中出现巨大错误，而且没有人会注意到。

But I wasn't the only person on that team - we had three staff, so we were spending something in the range of $400,000 in payroll and producing no revenue.  

但我不是那个团队中唯一的人——我们有 3 名员工，所以我们在工资单上花费了大约 400,000 美元，但没有产生任何收入。  

We frequently went through a rollercoaster of emotions, where we'd strategise and think about how to finally do something interesting and worthwhile, get rebuffed because people actually just wanted their spreadsheets delivered faster, and... despair.  

我们经常经历情绪的过山车，我们会制定战略并思考如何最终做一些有趣和有价值的事情，因为人们实际上只是希望他们的电子表格更快地交付而遭到拒绝，然后......绝望。

This began to wear on me eventually, but I put it down to the first organisation being unusually bad. Eventually, I found a job that should have come with considerably more autonomy at a non-profit. And it was exactly the same.  

这最终开始让我厌烦，但我将其归因于第一个组织异常糟糕。最终，我在一家非营利组织找到了一份本应拥有更多自主权的工作。而且完全一样。  

I found myself in a dreary gray office, where most of the staff hated the people that they were helping. The institution produced a fair amount of academic research, but the vast majority of it was essentially fraudulent.  

我发现自己在一个沉闷的灰色办公室里，那里的大多数员工都讨厌他们正在帮助的人。该机构进行了大量的学术研究，但其中绝大多数本质上是欺诈性的。  

We had some contracts with industry to produce technology in the space, but these mostly seemed to consist of the organisation fumbling the projects and massaging the truth (read: lying) until they could collect more funding.  

我们与工业界签订了一些合同，以在该领域生产技术，但这些合同似乎主要是由该组织摸索项目和捏造事实（读作：撒谎）直到他们能够筹集到更多资金。

I had one more attempt at doing something where I'd try to produce something - anything - working in a unit that assisted emergency services. This time I was a lot more optimistic. The people were extremely intelligent and clearly cared about the mission...  

我又一次尝试做一些我想做的事情——任何东西——在一个协助紧急服务的部门工作。这次我乐观多了。人们非常聪明，显然关心任务......  

but I think anyone that's worked for anything government-adjacent will understand that we never delivered anything.  

但我认为任何为与政府相邻的任何机构工作过的人都会明白，我们从未交付过任何东西。  

I joined towards the tail-end of a failed cloud migration, was immediately pulled off a project that might do something meaningful to connect spreadsheets to databases, and didn't last long.  

我加入了一个失败的云迁移的尾声，立即退出了一个项目，该项目可能会做一些有意义的事情来将电子表格连接到数据库，但并没有持续很长时间。

At this stage I was three-for-three on jobs that did absolutely nothing, and more importantly, I had formed some deep relationships.  

在这个阶段，我做的是三对三的工作，但更重要的是，我已经建立了一些深厚的关系。  

The funny thing about everyone secretly despairing is that they're usually not too far from forming deep connections the moment you let your own mask slip.  

每个人都暗自绝望的有趣之处在于，当你揭开自己的面具时，他们通常离建立深厚的联系不远了。  

The absolutely fucked up thing is that everyone I've met in this space seems to have totally given up on doing anything meaningful at work.  

绝对糟糕的是，我在这个领域遇到的每个人似乎都完全放弃了在工作中做任何有意义的事情。  

The goal is to get paid, not stress out, have a happy office where everyone can collect their strange handout, and not think too deeply about how unfulfilling is it to produce nothing for forty hours a week.  

目标是获得报酬，而不是压力大，拥有一个快乐的办公室，每个人都可以在其中收集他们奇怪的讲义，并且不要深入思考每周 40 小时什么都不做是多么令人不快。  

As far as lives go, in some ways it's more admirable than the blatant veneration of money. At least human happiness is a major concern.  

就生活而言，在某些方面，它比公然崇拜金钱更令人钦佩。至少人类的幸福是一个主要问题。

I've heard from more than one person, and heard myself saying, that the first thing I would do if I was in charge would be to fire myself, as the immediate savings would be the greatest outcome anyone had ever produced in the team.  

我从不止一个人那里听到，也听到我自己说，如果我负责，我会做的第一件事就是解雇自己，因为立即节省的费用将是团队中任何人所能取得的最大成果。

Still, I was perplexed. Of course, I was familiar with cynicism around work. It's hardly a novel concept, it permeates the culture, and it was further popularized by the late David Graeber's writing on _Bullshit Jobs_. Also, as a rough rule, cynicism makes you _seem_ clever (and to spare other young people learning this the hard way, it makes you obnoxious to be around when expressed too much), so it was certainly something I had started to affect, but never internalized. How on _earth_ could we have what seemed to be an entire industry of people who all knew their jobs were pointless?  

尽管如此，我还是很困惑。当然，我对工作中的愤世嫉俗很熟悉。这几乎不是一个新概念，它渗透到文化中，并且在已故的 David Graeber 关于 Bullshit Jobs 的文章中进一步普及。另外，作为一个粗略的规则，愤世嫉俗会让你看起来很聪明（并且为了避免其他年轻人通过艰难的方式学习这一点，当你表现得太多时，你会让人讨厌），所以这肯定是我开始影响的事情，但是从未内化。我们到底怎么可能拥有似乎整个行业都知道自己的工作毫无意义的人？

### Talking about data is signalling  

谈数据就是发信号

What I hadn't really grasped was the degree to which some organisations have grown so absurdly fat that they could afford to dispose of millions of dollars on employees who did _nothing_ other than reaffirm a vague commitment to being data driven. The same people that _love_ technology affirming language seem to largely be the same people who will insist that everything be delivered in a spreadsheet format. They also can't code - the degree to which my teams sucked was basically directly correlated to how good my manager's people skills were _and_ whether they had programming experience.  

我没有真正理解的是，一些组织已经发展到如此荒谬的程度，以至于他们有能力在员工身上花费数百万美元，而这些员工除了重申对数据驱动的模糊承诺外什么也没做。喜欢技术肯定语言的人似乎在很大程度上是坚持所有内容都以电子表格格式提供的人。他们也不会编码——我的团队的糟糕程度基本上与我的经理的人际交往能力有多好以及他们是否有编程经验直接相关。  

In any case, it's fine to talk about modernization but also demand everything be done the lazy way, because talking about the love of technology signals that everyone involved is modern and willing to endorse any viewpoint beneficial to the organisation, but getting the spreadsheet _right now_ means that you can look good for quick delivery. Why not have your cake and eat it too?  

在任何情况下，谈论现代化都很好，但也要求一切都以懒惰的方式完成，因为谈论对技术的热爱表明所涉及的每个人都是现代的，并且愿意认可任何对组织有益的观点，但现在就获取电子表格意味着您可以看起来不错，可以快速交货。为什么不吃你的蛋糕呢？

### Terrible data makes doing anything good impossible  

糟糕的数据让做任何事都变得不可能

Most organisations seem to have created their data stored as compacted Hell-bricks jammed into a teetering edifice which threatens to crush anyone who so much as breathes near it.  

大多数组织似乎都将他们的数据存储为压缩的地狱砖，这些砖块被塞进摇摇欲坠的大厦中，威胁要压垮任何靠近它的人。  

It is frequently such a Herculean task to even put together a dataset that represents a clear view of what the organisation is doing that you just can't. That is, the thing you have been hired to do is not possible.  

甚至将一个数据集放在一起来代表组织正在做的事情的清晰视图通常是一项艰巨的任务，而你做不到。也就是说，你受雇去做的事情是不可能的。  

But that would mean that you, your colleagues, and almost all those managers should be fired, so we just don't talk about it aloud.  

但这将意味着你、你的同事和几乎所有这些经理都应该被解雇，所以我们只是不要大声谈论它。

### Vision is hard  

视力很难

Most organisations don't have people with the right incentives and vision to push for real change, and only getting part of the formula right seems to lead to no outcome at all.  

大多数组织都没有合适的激励措施和远见来推动真正的变革，而且只把公式的一部分弄对似乎根本不会产生任何结果。  

I've seen a machine learning project take several years to come to fruition, but there was no plan to do anything with the model's output, so we have a model and no plan to intervene based on its output.  

我见过一个机器学习项目需要几年时间才能取得成果，但没有计划对模型的输出做任何事情，所以我们有一个模型，没有计划根据它的输出进行干预。  

But that doesn't stop management from discussing it like it's a huge success, as per the idea of data talk really being signalling (the secret is not measuring any outcomes).  

但这并不能阻止管理层讨论它，就像它取得了巨大的成功一样，根据数据谈话真正发出信号的想法（秘密不衡量任何结果）。

### Friction with internal policy  

与内部政策的摩擦

There are usually at least a few tasks required for the organisation to function, such as producing some sort of report for the government, that technically does need to happen, so we can't simply lay everyone off.  

组织运作通常至少需要一些任务，例如为政府制作某种报告，技术上确实需要发生，所以我们不能简单地解雇所有人。  

Frequently it's a task that one competent developer could probably automate forever, were it not for that developer needing a small army to handle the logistics of navigating the bureaucracy of getting one change request passed.  

通常这是一个有能力的开发人员可能永远自动化的任务，如果不是因为开发人员需要一支小军队来处理通过一个变更请求的官僚机构的后勤工作。  

My first team asked for an EC2 instance with just enough compute to trigger a bash script using Airflow, and we were quoted $40,000. This is the some section of the organisation's way of saying "fuck off".  

我的第一个团队要求一个 EC2 实例，其计算量刚好足以使用 Airflow 触发 bash 脚本，我们的报价为 40,000 美元。这是该组织说“滚蛋”的方式的一部分。  

Getting these requests pushed through requires enough staff that the person asking for them is considered important.  

推动这些请求需要足够的工作人员，以至于请求他们的人被认为是重要的。

So one person could do the job, but the organisation forces us to hire more people (and listen, I'm sympathetic - the team telling us to fuck off were themselves in some sort of perpetual gridlock), so that the manager of those people is important enough to enable the one person to do the job.  

所以一个人可以完成这项工作，但组织迫使我们雇用更多人（听着，我很同情 - 告诉我们滚蛋的团队本身陷入了某种永久性的僵局），所以那些人的经理重要到足以让一个人完成这项工作。  

And, you know, it's government reporting. Even when I _did_ do one of these necessary tasks, it wasn't exactly what I imagined doing with my finite time on this earth, at least when it was my _only_ measurable output.  

而且，你知道，这是政府报告。即使当我确实完成了其中一项必要的任务时，这也不是我想象中在地球上有限的时间里所做的事情，至少当它是我唯一可衡量的输出时。

### Free money attracts conmen  

免费的钱吸引骗子

Piles of money + unclear outcomes = every grifter under the sun begins to migrate to your organisation. It is very hard to keep them all out, and they naturally begin to let other grifters in because they all run interference for each other.  

成堆的钱 + 不明确的结果 = 天底下的每个骗子都开始迁移到你的组织。很难将他们全部拒之门外，他们自然而然地开始让其他骗子进来，因为他们都互相干扰。  

Sure, they might betray each other constantly, but they _won't_ challenge the social fiction that some sort of meaningful work is happening.  

当然，他们可能会不断地背叛对方，但他们不会挑战正在发生某种有意义的工作的社会小说。

### Conclusions right now  

现在的结论

I've punched this all out over one evening, and I'm still figuring things out myself, but here's what I've got so far.  

我已经用一个晚上把这一切都解决了，我还在自己想办法，但这就是我到目前为止所得到的。

I've realized that applying to jobs expecting this to get better is probably a terrible play.  

我已经意识到，申请一份期望情况会变得更好的工作可能是一场糟糕的比赛。  

There are almost certainly organisations that don't run this way, but it's not like producing something that isn't literally worthless is sufficient to enjoy spending most of your life doing it.  

几乎可以肯定的是，有些组织不会以这种方式运行，但这并不是说生产出一些并非毫无价值的东西就足以让你享受一生中的大部分时间。  

For some people, it's taking care of their families, or they're trapped in the job because they have debt. For others, they really have found something they deeply enjoy.  

对于一些人来说，这是为了照顾他们的家人，或者他们因为负债而被困在工作中。对其他人来说，他们真的找到了自己深深喜欢的东西。  

But for many people still on their way to some level of actualization at work, we're going through the process of gradually shedding each layer of dissatisfaction, only to turn up new ones.  

但对于许多仍在工作中实现某种程度实现的人来说，我们正在经历逐渐摆脱每一层不满的过程，只会产生新的不满。  

There's presumably a layer when you're done with this, but I frankly don't feel like I have enough time in my life to hop through these jobs until I find the right fit when I see people in their 40s that haven't managed it yet.  

当你完成这项工作时，大概会有一层，但坦率地说，当我看到 40 多岁的人还没有成功时，我觉得我一生中没有足够的时间来跳过这些工作，直到我找到合适的人选还没完成。

I've spoken to consultants who feel successful, but long for meaning. And public sector workers who deeply believe in the mission, but long for actual success. And yes, a few people who are actually deeply happy with their work (but none of them are in I.T thus far).  

我曾与感到成功但渴望意义的顾问交谈过。以及深信使命但渴望实际成功的公共部门工作人员。是的，有一些人实际上对他们的工作非常满意（但到目前为止他们都没有从事 IT 工作）。

The two people who were most happy? The first was a friend who had worked for the government, and gradually become incredibly disillusioned with their labour after producing nothing for years but continuing to get paid.  

最幸福的两个人？第一个是一位曾为政府工作的朋友，在多年没有生产但继续获得报酬后，逐渐对他们的劳动感到难以置信的幻灭。  

They eventually quit their incredibly cushy job and sold books for a few months at a big retail chain - and they said it was incredibly therapeutic. They finally felt they were _doing_ something worthwhile, as simple as it was. That said, they did also say the experience was great only while romanticizing it a bit, and that it probably would have felt very different if they felt trapped in it as a career for years.  

他们最终辞掉了令人难以置信的轻松工作，在一家大型零售连锁店卖了几个月的书——他们说这非常有治疗作用。他们终于觉得自己在做一些有价值的事情，尽管事情很简单。话虽如此，他们也确实表示，这种经历只是在将其浪漫化了一点的情况下才很棒，而且如果他们觉得多年来一直被困在这个职业中，感觉可能会大不相同。  

They're still figuring things out (they've moved from the "this is worthless" layer of the despair lasagna to the "this has worth, but not enough to spends years on" layer), but they're certainly doing better.  

他们仍在想办法解决问题（他们已经从绝望千层面的“这毫无价值”层转移到“这有价值，但不足以在上面花费数年”层），但他们确实做得更好。

The second was my barber. He's an immigrant here, and started a very successful business.  

第二个是我的理发师。他是这里的移民，开始了非常成功的生意。  

Unlike the young tech entrepreneurs I typically meet (who glorify money and the wealthy in a way I find grotesque), he's a very quiet man who has incredibly happy employees and remembers every customer by name.  

与我通常遇到的年轻科技企业家（他们以一种我觉得怪诞的方式美化金钱和富人）不同，他是一个非常安静的人，拥有令人难以置信的快乐员工，并能记住每一位客户的名字。  

On an impulse, I asked him why he started his own business when he could easily have earned a good living just working for an existing company.  

一时冲动，我问他为什么要自己创业，因为他只要在一家现有的公司工作就可以轻松地过上好日子。

He said that he hated the feeling of churning work out on an assembly line ($25 per haircut, you'd better get four customers done an hour!), and wanted to replicate the experience he was used to in his home country.  

他说他讨厌在流水线上忙碌的感觉（每次理发 25 美元，你最好一个小时为四个客户做完！），并且想复制他在祖国习惯的经历。  

He doubled the price and the amount of time he could spend with each customer, and held to the conviction that people would be willing to pay for quality and time, even if it wasn't cheap or expedient.  

他将价格和与每位顾客相处的时间加倍，并坚信人们愿意为质量和时间买单，即使这并不便宜或不方便。  

He has three branches up now, and his employees talk about him like he's a father to them. He has carved out a little part of the city where people are taken care of, feel safe, and deliver something they care about.  

他现在拥有三个分支机构，他的员工谈论他就像他是他们的父亲一样。他在这座城市中开辟了一小部分，人们在这里得到照顾，感到安全，并提供他们关心的东西。

Right now, that's what feels right to me - those of us who are despairing, we're chasing quality and meaning, and we can't do it while we're taking orders from people with the wrong vision, the wrong incentives, at dysfunctional organisations, and with data that makes our tasks fundamentally impossible in the first place.  

现在，这对我来说是正确的——我们这些绝望的人，我们正在追求质量和意义，当我们接受那些眼光错误、动机错误的人的命令时，我们无法做到这一点，在功能失调的组织，以及使我们的任务从一开始就根本不可能完成的数据。  

Quality takes time, and right now, it definitely feels like there isn't much of a place for that in the workplace.  

质量需要时间，而现在，在工作场所肯定没有太多的位置。
