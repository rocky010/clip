A few things I’ve come to terms with:  

我已经接受了一些事情：

There is rarely more or less economic uncertainty; just [changes in how ignorant people are](https://collabfund.com/blog/endless-uncertainty/) to potential risks.  

很少有或多或少的经济不确定性；只是改变了人们对潜在风险的无知程度。

You should obsess over risks that do permanent damage and care little about risks that do temporary harm, but the opposite is more common.  

你应该着迷于造成永久性损害的风险，而不关心造成暂时性损害的风险，但相反的情况更为常见。

The only way to build wealth is to have a gap between your ego and your income.  

积累财富的唯一方法是让你的自我和你的收入之间存在差距。

Everyone belongs to a tribe and underestimates how influential that tribe is on their thinking.  

每个人都属于一个部落，并且低估了该部落对他们思想的影响力。

A lot of financial debates are just people with different time horizons talking over each other.  

许多金融辩论只是具有不同时间范围的人互相交谈。

It’s easy to mistake “I’m good at this” with “Others are bad at this” in a way that makes you overestimate how valuable your skills are.  

很容易将“我擅长这个”误认为“其他人不擅长这个”，这会让你高估自己技能的价值。

It’s important to know the difference between rosy optimism and periods of chaos that trend upward.  

重要的是要知道乐观的乐观情绪和呈上升趋势的混乱时期之间的区别。

If your expectations grow faster than your income you’ll never be happy with your money no matter how much you accumulate.  

如果你的期望增长速度快于你的收入增长速度，那么无论你积累了多少，你都不会对你的钱感到满意。

The inability to forecast the past has no impact on our desire to forecast the future. Certainty is so valuable that we’ll never give up the quest for it, and most people couldn’t get out of bed in the morning if they were honest about how uncertain the future is.  

无法预测过去不会影响我们预测未来的愿望。确定性是如此宝贵，以至于我们永远不会放弃对它的追求，而且大多数人如果诚实地知道未来有多么不确定，早上就起不来床。

Having no FOMO might be the most important investing skill.  

没有 FOMO 可能是最重要的投资技巧。

Few things are as valuable in the modern world as a good bullshit detector.  

在现代世界中，很少有东西比一个好的废话探测器更有价值。

Most of what people call “conviction” is a willful disregard for new information that might make you change your mind. That’s when beliefs turn dangerous.  

大多数人所说的“信念”是故意无视可能使您改变主意的新信息。那就是信念变得危险的时候。

People have vastly different desires, except for three things: Respect, feeling useful, and control over their time. Those are nearly universal.  

除了三件事之外，人们的愿望截然不同：尊重、感觉有用和控制自己的时间。这些几乎是普遍的。

The market is rational but investors play different games and those games look irrational to people playing a different game.  

市场是理性的，但投资者玩不同的游戏，而这些游戏在玩不同游戏的人看来是不合理的。

There’s a sweet spot where you grasp the important stuff but you’re not smart enough to be bored with it.  

有一个甜蜜的地方，你可以抓住重要的东西，但你不够聪明，不会厌倦它。

A big takeaway from economic history is that the past wasn’t as good as you remember, the present isn’t as bad as you think, and the future will be better than you anticipate.  

经济史的一个重要收获是，过去并不像你记忆中的那么好，现在并不像你想象的那么糟糕，未来会比你预期的更好。

Most assholes are going through something terrible in their life. People hide their skeletons, which requires blind forgiveness of their quirks and moods because you’re unaware of what they’re dealing with.  

大多数混蛋在他们的生活中都经历过一些可怕的事情。人们隐藏自己的骨架，这需要盲目地原谅他们的怪癖和情绪，因为你不知道他们在处理什么。

History is driven by surprising events but forecasting is driven by obvious ones.  

历史是由令人惊讶的事件驱动的，而预测是由显而易见的事件驱动的。

Pessimism always sounds smarter than optimism because optimism sounds like a sales pitch while pessimism sounds like someone trying to help you.  

悲观主义听起来总是比乐观主义更聪明，因为乐观主义听起来像是推销，而悲观主义听起来像是有人试图帮助你。

Every past decline looks like an opportunity and every future decline looks like a risk.  

过去的每一次下跌看起来都是一个机会，而未来的每一次下跌看起来都是一个风险。

A comforting delusion is thinking that other people’s bad circumstances couldn’t also happen to you.  

一个令人欣慰的错觉是认为其他人的糟糕情况不可能也发生在你身上。

For many people the process of becoming wealthier feels better than having wealth.  

对于许多人来说，变得更富有的过程比拥有财富感觉更好。

Something can be factually true but contextually nonsense. Bad ideas often have at least some seed of truth that gives their followers confidence.  

有些事情可能在事实上是正确的，但在上下文中是胡说八道。糟糕的想法通常至少有一些真理的种子，让他们的追随者充满信心。

Every market valuation is a number from today multiplied by a story about tomorrow.  

每个市场估值都是今天的数字乘以明天的故事。

Comedians are the only good thought leaders because they understand how the world works but they want to make you laugh rather than make themselves feel smart.  

喜剧演员是唯一优秀的思想领袖，因为他们了解世界的运作方式，但他们想让你发笑而不是让自己觉得自己很聪明。

People learn when they’re surprised. Not when they read the right answer, or are told they’re doing it wrong, but when they experience a gap between expectations and reality.  

人们在惊讶时学习。不是当他们读到正确答案或被告知他们做错了，而是当他们体验到期望与现实之间的差距时。

People tend to know what makes them angry with more certainty than what might make them happy. Happiness is complicated because you keep moving the goalposts. Misery is more predictable.  

人们往往更清楚是什么让他们生气，而不是什么会让他们开心。幸福是复杂的，因为你不断移动球门柱。苦难更容易预测。

Getting rich and staying rich are different things that require different skills.  

致富和保持富有是不同的事情，需要不同的技能。

Money’s greatest intrinsic value is its ability to give you control over your time.  

金钱最大的内在价值在于它能让你控制自己的时间。

Past success always seems easier than it was because you now know how the story ends, and you can’t unremember what you know today when trying to remember how you felt in the past.  

过去的成功似乎总是比以前容易，因为你现在知道故事的结局，而且当你试图记住过去的感受时，你不可能忘记你今天所知道的。

“Learn enough from history to respect one another’s delusions.” -Will Durant  

“从历史中吸取足够的教训，尊重彼此的错觉。” -威尔·杜兰特

There’s more to learn from people who endured risk than those who seemingly conquered it, because the kind of skills you need to endure risk are more likely repeatable and relevant to future risks.  

与那些看似征服了风险的人相比，从那些忍受过风险的人身上可以学到更多东西，因为你需要承受风险的技能更有可能是可重复的，并且与未来的风险相关。

Nothing too good or too bad stays that way forever, because great times plant the seeds of their own destruction through complacency and leverage, and bad times plant the seeds of their own turnaround through opportunity and panic-driven problem-solving.  

没有什么太好或太坏会永远保持这种状态，因为伟大的时代通过自满和杠杆播下了自我毁灭的种子，而糟糕的时代则通过机会和恐慌驱动的解决问题播下了他们自己扭转局面的种子。

Most people can afford to not be a great investor. But they can’t afford to be a bad investor.  

大多数人都不能成为一个伟大的投资者。但他们不能成为一个糟糕的投资者。

What money can and can’t do for you isn’t intuitive, so most people are surprised at how they feel when they suddenly have more or less than before.  

金钱能为你做什么和不能做什么不是直觉的，所以大多数人都会惊讶于当他们突然比以前拥有更多或更少时的感受。

Your personal experiences make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.  

你的个人经历可能占世界上发生的事情的 0.00000001%，但可能占你认为世界运作方式的 80%。

Unsustainable things can last longer than you anticipate.  

不可持续的事物可能会比您预期的持续时间更长。

“The thing that is least perceived about wealth is that all pleasure in money ends at the point where economy becomes unnecessary. The man who can buy anything he covets, without any consultation with his banker, values nothing that he buys.” - William Dawson  

“人们对财富最不了解的一点是，当经济变得不必要时，所有对金钱的愉悦都会结束。一个人可以购买任何他想要的东西，而无需与他的银行家进行任何协商，他不会珍惜他购买的任何东西。” - 威廉道森

Napoleon’s definition of a military genius was “The man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing his mind.” It’s the same in business and investing.  

拿破仑对军事天才的定义是“当周围的人都失去理智时，他还能做一般人的事”。这在商业和投资中是一样的。

It’s hard to tell the difference between boldness and recklessness, greed and ambition, contrarian and wrong.  

很难说出大胆与鲁莽、贪婪与野心、逆势与错误之间的区别。

Woodrow Wilson talked about whether something was accountable to Darwin or accountable to Newton. It’s a useful idea. Everything is accountable to one of the two, and you have to know whether something adapts and changes over time or perpetually stays the same.  

伍德罗·威尔逊谈到某事是对达尔文负责还是对牛顿负责。这是一个有用的想法。一切都对两者之一负责，你必须知道某些东西是否会随着时间的推移而适应和变化，或者永远保持不变。

Risk has two stages: First, when it actually hits. Then, when its scars influence our subsequent decisions. The recession, and the lingering pessimism that does as much damage.  

风险有两个阶段：首先，当它真正发生时。然后，当它的伤疤影响到我们后来的决定时。经济衰退和挥之不去的悲观情绪造成了同样大的破坏。

Tell people what they want to hear and you can be wrong indefinitely without penalty.  

告诉人们他们想听什么，你可以无限期地犯错而不受惩罚。

Optimism and pessimism always overshoot because the only way to know the boundaries of either is to go a little bit past them.  

乐观和悲观总是过火，因为了解两者界限的唯一方法就是稍微超越它们。

Reputations have momentum in both directions because people want to associate with winners and avoid losers.  

声誉在两个方向都有动力，因为人们希望与成功者交往并避免失败者。

It’s easier to lie with numbers than words, because people understand stories but their eyes glaze over with numbers. As the saying goes, more fiction has been written in Excel than Word.  

用数字说谎比用文字说谎更容易，因为人们听得懂故事，但他们的眼睛却被数字迷住了。俗话说，用 Excel 写的小说比用 Word 写的多。

It’s easy to take advantage of people. It’s also easy to underestimate the power and influence of groups of people who have been taken advantage of for too long.  

利用人很容易。人们也很容易低估被长期利用的人群的力量和影响力。

You have five seconds to get people’s attention. Books, blogs, emails, reports, it doesn’t matter – if you don’t sell them in five seconds you’ve exhausted most of their patience.  

你有五秒钟的时间来引起人们的注意。书籍、博客、电子邮件、报告，没关系——如果你在五秒钟内不卖掉它们，你就已经耗尽了他们的大部分耐心。

It always looks like we haven’t innovated in 10 or 20 years because it can take10 or 20 years before an innovation is an obvious success.  

看起来我们已经有 10 年或 20 年没有创新了，因为创新可能需要 10 年或 20 年才能取得明显的成功。

When and where you were born can have a bigger impact on your outcome in life than anything you do intentionally.  

你出生的时间和地点对你的人生结果的影响比你有意做的任何事情都要大。

Most people are good at learning facts but not great at learning rules – the broad lessons from events that will apply to future events.  

大多数人善于学习事实，但不善于学习规则——从事件中吸取的广泛教训将适用于未来事件。

Everyone is making a bet on an unknown future. It’s only called speculation when you disagree with someone else’s bet.  

每个人都在为未知的未来下注。只有当您不同意别人的赌注时，才称为投机。

There are two types of information: stuff you’ll still care about in the future, and stuff that matters less and less over time. Long-term vs. expiring knowledge. It’s critical to identify which is which when you come across something new.  

有两种类型的信息：一种是您将来仍会关心的信息，另一种是随着时间的推移越来越不重要的信息。长期知识与过期知识。当您遇到新事物时，确定哪个是哪个至关重要。

The same traits needed for outlier success are the same traits that increase the odds of failure. The line between bold and reckless is thin.  

异常成功所需的相同特征与增加失败几率的相同特征。大胆和鲁莽之间的界限很小。  

So be careful blindly praising successes or criticizing failures, as they often made similar decisions with slightly different levels of luck.  

所以要小心盲目地赞美成功或批评失败，因为他们经常做出类似的决定，但运气水平略有不同。

When communicating, “know your audience” easily becomes “pander to your audience.”  

沟通时，“了解你的听众”很容易变成“迎合你的听众”。

Most financial mistakes come when you try to force things to happen faster than is required. Compounding doesn’t like when you try to use a cheat code.  

大多数财务错误都是在您试图强迫事情发生得比要求的更快时发生的。当您尝试使用作弊代码时，复合不喜欢。

There is an optimal net worth for most people, after which not only does happiness stop increasing but more money becomes a social and psychological liability. The number is different for everyone, but is probably lower than most people think.  

大多数人都有一个最佳净资产，之后不仅幸福不再增加，而且更多的钱成为一种社会和心理负担。每个人的数字都不同，但可能比大多数人想象的要低。

Risk is what you can’t see, think only happens to other people, aren’t paying attention to, are willfully ignoring, and isn’t in the news. A little surprise usually does more damage than something big that’s been in the news for months.  

风险是你看不到的，认为只发生在其他人身上，没有引起注意，故意忽视，也没有出现在新闻中。一个小惊喜通常比几个月来一直在新闻中出现的大事件造成的伤害更大。

Innovation and economics can be miles apart. Twitter directly influences geopolitics between nuclear states and is worth half as much as Progressive Auto Insurance.  

创新和经济可能相距甚远。 Twitter 直接影响核国家之间的地缘政治，其价值是 Progressive Auto Insurance 的一半。

Risk management is less about how you respond to risk and more about recognizing how many things can go wrong before they actually do.  

风险管理与您如何应对风险无关，而更多地与在实际发生之前识别出有多少事情可能出错有关。

There is too much marketing (waving your arms) and not enough branding (building trust).  

市场营销太多（挥舞手臂）而品牌建设（建立信任）不足。

A lot of people don’t realize what bet they’re making. Maybe they thought they were betting on disruptive technology, but it turned out they were betting on low interest rates.  

很多人都没有意识到他们在做什么赌注。也许他们认为他们押注于颠覆性技术，但事实证明他们押注于低利率。  

Or they thought they were betting on alternative energy, but it turned out they were betting on subsidies and tax credits. Many bets don’t work not because your bet was wrong, but because you didn’t realize the bet you were making in the first place.  

或者他们认为他们押注于替代能源，但事实证明他们押注于补贴和税收抵免。许多赌注没有成功，不是因为你的赌注错了，而是因为你没有意识到你一开始就下了赌注。

Housing is often a liability masquerading as a safe asset.  

住房通常是一种伪装成安全资产的负债。

Asking what the biggest risks are is like asking what you expect to be surprised about. If you knew what the biggest risk was you would do something about it, and doing something about it makes it less risky.  

询问最大的风险是什么就像询问您希望对什么感到惊讶一样。如果你知道最大的风险是什么，你就会做点什么，而做点什么可以降低风险。  

What your imagination can’t fathom is the dangerous stuff, and it’s why risk can never be mastered.  

你的想象力无法理解的是危险的东西，这就是为什么风险永远无法被控制的原因。

A lot of good writing makes points that people already intuitively know but haven’t yet put into words. It works because readers learn something new without having to expend much energy questioning whether it’s true.  

很多好的文章表达了人们已经凭直觉知道但还没有用语言表达的观点。它之所以有效，是因为读者无需花费太多精力去质疑它是否正确就可以学到新东西。  

The alternatives are points that are obvious and well known (boring) or something that’s non-obvious and unknown (often takes too much effort to understand and impatient readers leave).  

备选方案是显而易见且广为人知（无聊）的要点或不明显且未知的事物（通常需要花费太多精力才能理解并且不耐烦的读者离开）。

Emotions can override any level of intelligence.  

情绪可以超越任何水平的智力。

Small risks are overblown because they’re easy to talk about, big risks are discounted and ignored because they seem preposterous before they arrive.  

小风险被夸大了，因为它们很容易谈论，大风险被低估和忽视，因为它们在到达之前看起来很荒谬。

If you have an idea but think “someone has already done that,” just remember there are 1,010 published biographies of Winston Churchill.  

如果您有一个想法，但认为“有人已经做到了”，请记住，有 1,010 部已出版的温斯顿·丘吉尔传记。

No one is thinking about you as much as you are.  

没有人像你一样想念你。

John D. Rockefeller was worth the equivalent of $400 billion, but he never had penicillin, sunscreen, or Advil. For most of his adult life he didn’t have electric lights, air conditioning, or sunglasses. Everything about wealth is circumstances in the context of expectations.  

约翰·D·洛克菲勒 (John D. Rockefeller) 的身家相当于 4000 亿美元，但他从未使用过青霉素、防晒霜或 Advil。在他成年后的大部分时间里，他没有电灯、空调或太阳镜。关于财富的一切都是期望背景下的情况。

Read fewer forecasts and more history. Study more failures and fewer successes.  

少读预测，多读历史。研究更多的失败和更少的成功。

There is an optimal amount of bullshit in life. Having no tolerance for hassle, nonsense and inefficiency is not an admirable trait; it’s denying reality. Once you accept a certain level of BS, you stop denying its existence and have a clearer view of how the world works.  

生活中有一个最佳数量的废话。不容忍麻烦、废话和低效不是一个令人钦佩的品质；它否认现实。一旦你接受了某种程度的 BS，你就不再否认它的存在，并对世界的运作方式有了更清晰的认识。

Most problems are more complicated than they look but most solutions should be simpler than they are.  

大多数问题比看起来更复杂，但大多数解决方案应该比实际情况更简单。

About once a decade people forget that bubbles form and burst about once a decade.  

大约每十年一次，人们会忘记泡沫的形成和破裂大约每十年一次。

If something is impossible to know you are better off not being very smart, because smart people fool themselves into thinking they know while average people are more likely to shrug their shoulders and end up closer to reality.  

如果某件事不可能知道，你最好不要很聪明，因为聪明人自欺欺人地认为他们知道，而普通人更有可能耸耸肩，最终更接近现实。

You can’t believe in risk without also believing in luck because they are fundamentally the same thing—an acknowledgment that things outside of your control can have a bigger impact on outcomes than anything you do on your own.  

你不能不相信运气就相信风险，因为它们在根本上是一样的——承认你无法控制的事情对结果的影响比你自己做的任何事情都要大。

“Reality will pay you back in equal proportion to your delusion.” – Will Smith  

“现实会以与你的错觉相同的比例回报你。” - 威尔史密斯

A common irony goes like this:  

一个常见的讽刺是这样的：

-   Paranoia leads to success because it keeps you on your toes.  
    
    偏执狂导致成功，因为它让你保持警惕。
    
-   But paranoia is stressful, so you abandon it quickly once you achieve success.  
    
    但偏执是有压力的，所以一旦你取得成功，你就会很快放弃它。
    
-   Now you’ve abandoned what made you successful and you begin to decline – which is even more stressful.  
    
    现在你已经放弃了让你成功的东西，你开始走下坡路——这会带来更大的压力。
    

Risk’s greatest fuels are leverage, overconfidence, ego, and impatience. Its greatest antidote is having options, humility, and other people’s trust.  

风险的最大燃料是杠杆作用、过度自信、自我和急躁。它最大的解毒剂是拥有选择权、谦逊和他人的信任。

Once-in-a-century events happen all the time because lots of unrelated things can go wrong.  

百年一遇的事件一直在发生，因为许多不相关的事情都可能出错。  

If there’s a 1% chance of a new disastrous pandemic, a 1% chance of a crippling depression, a 1% chance of a catastrophic flood, a 1% chance of political collapse, and on and on, then the odds that _something_ bad will happen next year – or any year – are … pretty good. It’s why Arnold Toynbee says history is “just one damn thing after another.”  

如果有 1% 的可能性发生新的灾难性流行病，有 1% 的可能性发生严重的萧条，有 1% 的可能性发生灾难性洪水，有 1% 的可能性发生政治崩溃，等等，那么坏事发生的可能性就会增加发生在明年——或任何一年——都……非常好。这就是为什么阿诺德汤因比说历史“只是一件又一件该死的事情”。

People suffering from sudden, unexpected hardship can adopt views they previously would have considered unthinkable.  

遭受突然的、意想不到的困难的人可以采纳他们以前认为不可想象的观点。

It’s easiest to convince people that you’re special if they don’t know you well enough to see all the ways you’re not.  

如果人们对你的了解不够深，看不到你不一样的地方，那么让他们相信你很特别是最容易的。

A large group of people can become better informed over time. But they can’t, on average, become more patient, less greedy, or more level-headed during periods of upheaval. That will never change.  

随着时间的推移，一大批人可以变得更加知情。但平均而言，他们无法在动荡时期变得更有耐心、不那么贪婪或更冷静。那永远不会改变。

Good ideas are easy to write, bad ideas are hard. Difficulty is a quality signal, and writer’s block usually indicates more about your ideas than your writing.  

好的想法很容易写，坏的想法很难。困难是一个质量信号，作家的障碍通常更多地表明你的想法而不是你的写作。

More people wake up every morning wanting to solve problems than wake up looking to cause harm. But people who cause harm get the most attention. So slow progress amid a drumbeat of bad news is the normal state of affairs.  

每天早上醒来想要解决问题的人多于醒来寻找造成伤害的人。但造成伤害的人最受关注。在一连串的坏消息中进展缓慢是常态。

Everything is sales.  

一切都是销售。
