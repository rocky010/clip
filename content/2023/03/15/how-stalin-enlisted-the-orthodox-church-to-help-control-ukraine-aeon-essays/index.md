In September 1943, as the tide of the Second World War was turning in the Soviet Union’s favour, the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin called a meeting at the Kremlin.  

1943年9月，当第二次世界大战的浪潮向苏联倾斜时，苏联领导人约瑟夫-斯大林在克里姆林宫召开会议。  

Alongside the foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov and the head of the secret police Vsevolod Merkulov were three men in Stalin’s office for the first time: Metropolitan Sergius, Metropolitan Aleksey, and Metropolitan Nikolay, three of the few Orthodox Church hierarchs left in the Soviet Union.  

与外交部长维亚切斯拉夫-莫洛托夫和秘密警察局长弗塞沃洛德-梅尔库洛夫一起，有三个人首次进入斯大林的办公室。大主教谢尔盖、大主教阿列克谢和大主教尼古拉，他们是苏联仅存的几位东正教主教中的三位。

The fact of such a meeting taking place is naturally surprising. Even those who know little about the Soviet Union are familiar with its anti-religious policies, especially thanks to Cold War rhetoric about ‘godless communists’.  

发生这样的会议的事实自然令人惊讶。即使那些对苏联知之甚少的人也熟悉它的反宗教政策，特别是由于冷战时期关于 "无神的共产主义者 "的言论。  

Indeed, this meeting was being held after decades of persecution of the Russian Orthodox Church by the officially atheist Soviet state. The three Metropolitans came to this meeting after decades of watching their Church decimated all around them.  

事实上，这次会议是在俄罗斯东正教会被官方无神论的苏维埃国家迫害了几十年之后召开的。这三位大主教是在看着他们的教会在他们周围被消灭了几十年后才来参加这次会议的。  

As they greeted Stalin at the Kremlin, many of their fellow clergy were imprisoned in labour camps – and others were dead.  

当他们在克里姆林宫迎接斯大林的时候，他们的许多神职人员同伴被囚禁在劳改营中--还有人已经死亡。  

By the end of the 1930s, the Soviet state had effectively destroyed much of the official existence of what had been for centuries imperial Russia’s most powerful and wealthy religious institution.  

到20世纪30年代末，苏维埃国家已经有效地摧毁了几个世纪以来帝国俄罗斯最强大和最富有的宗教机构的大部分官方存在。

But in September 1943, as Stalin imagined a role for a victorious Soviet Union in a postwar world, he began to reconsider his government’s position with regards to the Russian Orthodox Church, and eventually to the entire question of the role of religion in an atheist empire.  

但在1943年9月，当斯大林想象一个胜利的苏联在战后世界中的作用时，他开始重新考虑他的政府对俄罗斯东正教的立场，并最终考虑宗教在一个无神论帝国中的作用这一整个问题。  

At this meeting, Stalin presented these men with a bold proposal: the same Soviet state that had destroyed their Church was now going to devote its resources to bringing it back.  

在这次会议上，斯大林向这些人提出了一个大胆的建议：曾经摧毁了他们的教会的同一个苏联国家，现在要把它的资源用于恢复教会。

The story of this meeting and the proposal to revive Orthodoxy is rarely told – but, when it is mentioned, it is dismissed as a wartime measure, as temporary as the friendship campaigns between the USSR and the United States that also characterised the war years.  

这次会议和恢复东正教的建议的故事很少被提及--但是，当它被提及时，它被斥为战时措施，就像苏联和美国之间的友谊运动一样，也是战争年代的临时措施。  

Yet to gloss over this meeting is to miss its significance as a shift in the Soviet approach to religion, one that would leave a mark on religious life for Soviet people and their descendants in the decades that followed.  

然而，掩盖这次会议就会错过它作为苏联对待宗教方法的转变的意义，这种转变将在以后的几十年里给苏联人民及其后代的宗教生活留下印记。

What was the nature of this shift? It began with an acknowledgement that, despite the state’s efforts, religious ties and ideas of religious belonging resonated with its population.  

这种转变的性质是什么？它首先是承认，尽管国家做出了努力，但宗教联系和宗教归属的想法在其人口中产生了共鸣。  

Instead of ignoring the continued influence of religion, the state might be able to use it to its own advantage.  

与其无视宗教的持续影响，国家也许可以利用它来为自己服务。  

Rather than allow religious life to operate outside of Soviet society in the depths of the underground, the state could create an official religious life that could be surveilled, regulated, taxed and, most critically, used to accomplish political goals.  

与其让宗教生活在苏联社会之外的地下深处运作，国家可以建立一种官方的宗教生活，对其进行监督、管理、征税，最关键的是，用来实现政治目标。

This story does not change the importance of atheism to the Soviet project or the significance of the USSR’s founding as the world’s first atheist state.  

这个故事并没有改变无神论对苏联计划的重要性，也没有改变苏联作为世界上第一个无神论国家成立的意义。  

The anti-religious policies of the Bolsheviks came from both their interpretations of Marxism, as well as the particular Church-state relationship(s) that characterised imperial Russia.  

布尔什维克的反宗教政策既来自于他们对马克思主义的解释，也来自于帝国俄国特有的教会-国家关系。  

On the whole, any religion was seen as a barrier to the transformation the Bolshevik revolution envisioned because it offered a competing authority to the wisdom of the Party leaders who were leading the revolution.  

总的来说，任何宗教都被视为布尔什维克革命所设想的变革的障碍，因为它提供了一个与领导革命的党的领导人的智慧相竞争的权威。  

But in both the first anti-religious campaigns undertaken by the Bolsheviks as well as the more systematic and large-scale measures of the 1930s, Russian Orthodoxy was singled out because of its close ties to the old regime and its role as partner to the Russian autocracy.  

但在布尔什维克开展的第一批反宗教运动以及1930年代更系统、更大规模的措施中，俄罗斯东正教都被挑了出来，因为它与旧政权关系密切，是俄罗斯专制制度的伙伴。  

Russian Orthodoxy was dangerous in the eyes of the Bolsheviks not just because of its belief system, but also its institutional wealth and influence throughout Russian society.  

在布尔什维克眼中，俄罗斯东正教是危险的，不仅因为它的信仰体系，而且还因为它在整个俄罗斯社会的制度财富和影响。

Stalin’s new approach to Russian Orthodoxy was thus likely possible only because of previous anti-religious campaigns against the Church. State-enforced atheism and its official exceptions were two sides of the same coin.  

因此，斯大林对俄罗斯东正教的新做法很可能只是因为以前针对教会的反宗教运动。国家强制的无神论及其官方的例外情况是同一枚硬币的两面。  

As Stalin saw it, in the tumultuous decades between the Bolshevik revolution in 1917 and the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the Soviet project had been transformative enough that religious life no longer posed a threat.  

在斯大林看来，在1917年布尔什维克革命和1939年第二次世界大战爆发之间动荡的几十年里，苏联的项目已经有了足够的转变，宗教生活不再构成威胁。  

In the minds of the architects of the new religious policy, the state was powerful enough to not only control religious life but make it work for its own ends.  

在新宗教政策的设计者心目中，国家强大到不仅可以控制宗教生活，而且可以使其为自己的目的服务。

Historical spiritual ties could be used to support Soviet claims on eastern European territories  

历史上的精神纽带可被用来支持苏联对东欧领土的要求

The 1943 meeting led to a series of measures that created a new institutional framework for the Russian Orthodox Church to operate in the USSR.  

1943年的会议促成了一系列措施，为俄罗斯东正教会在苏联的运作建立了新的制度框架。  

These measures included re-establishing the Moscow Patriarchate, the official seat of the Russian Orthodox Church, and enthroning a Patriarch. Sacred properties expropriated by the state could once again be used by the Church.  

这些措施包括重建莫斯科牧首区，即俄罗斯东正教会的官方所在地，并册封一位牧首。被国家征用的神圣财产可以再次由教会使用。  

Seminaries were founded and clergy recruited to teach at them. But ultimate control over Church affairs and ownership of Church property remained with the state.  

神学院被建立起来，并招募神职人员在其中授课。但对教会事务的最终控制权和教会财产的所有权仍然属于国家。  

A new bureau was founded for the state administration of the Church: the Council for the Affairs of the Russian Orthodox Church.  

为教会的国家管理成立了一个新的局：俄罗斯东正教会事务委员会。

What goals was Stalin hoping to accomplish with these initial measures?  

斯大林希望通过这些最初的措施来实现什么目标？  

Insight into the answer to this question can be found in the questions Stalin began posing to state experts on religious life in advance of the meeting, questions that focused on the status of Orthodoxy in eastern Europe.  

从斯大林在会议前开始向国家宗教生活专家提出的问题中可以看出这个问题的答案，这些问题主要是关于东欧东正教的地位。  

It is no coincidence that Stalin was asking these questions at the moment the tide of war was turning. It was becoming clear to the Soviets that victory in the war could allow them to secure a sphere of influence in eastern Europe.  

斯大林在战局转折的时刻提出这些问题，并非巧合。苏联人越来越清楚，战争的胜利可以使他们在东欧获得一个势力范围。  

With an officially sanctioned Russian Orthodox Church in Moscow, historical spiritual ties could be used to support Soviet claims on eastern European territories and be used as vectors of political and cultural influence in places with Orthodox traditions, including eastern Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.  

在莫斯科有一个官方认可的俄罗斯东正教会，历史上的精神纽带可以被用来支持苏联对东欧领土的要求，并被用作在有东正教传统的地方，包括波兰东部、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和南斯拉夫的政治和文化影响的载体。  

This line of thinking helps underscore how Soviet views on religion had changed in just a short amount of time.  

这一思路有助于强调苏联对宗教的看法在短短的时间内发生了怎样的变化。  

The ties between religious communities that had the potential to transcend borders was originally perceived as a threat to the Soviet regime – now it was seen as something the government could use.  

有可能超越边界的宗教团体之间的联系最初被视为对苏维埃政权的威胁--现在它被视为政府可以利用的东西。

There were also other considerations. The Soviets were facing criticism by their wartime allies about the USSR’s lack of religious freedom.  

还有其他方面的考虑。苏联正面临战时盟友对苏联缺乏宗教自由的批评。  

The Red Army was also re-taking territory that had been occupied by the Nazis, and understood that the German occupying authorities had, as part of their own strategy, re-opened shuttered churches and mosques on Soviet soil.  

红军也在重新夺取被纳粹占领的领土，并了解到德国占领当局作为自己战略的一部分，在苏联领土上重新开放了关闭的教堂和清真寺。  

The Red Army was not so certain that they should be in the business of closing those again. But, in creating a space for an officially sanctioned Russian Orthodox Church, the state was doing more than addressing these immediate concerns – it was looking to a postwar future.  

红军并不确定他们是否应该再去关闭这些。但是，在为官方认可的俄罗斯东正教会创造一个空间时，国家所做的不仅仅是解决这些眼前的问题--它在展望战后的未来。

In evaluating the potential for what a state partnership with Russian Orthodoxy could do for Soviet power, Ukraine served as a testing ground, specifically the western region of Ukraine annexed from Poland to become part of the USSR during the Second World War.  

在评估与俄罗斯东正教建立国家伙伴关系对苏维埃政权的影响时，乌克兰成为一个试验场，特别是在第二次世界大战期间从波兰吞并的乌克兰西部地区，成为苏联的一部分。  

It is in the Soviet experience with these lands and its peoples that one can find the roots of the wartime shift in religion that culminated in the 1943 meeting.  

正是在苏联对这些土地及其人民的经验中，人们可以找到战时宗教转变的根源，这种转变在1943年的会议上达到顶峰。

In 1939, following the secret protocols of the Nazi-Soviet pact, the Soviet Union annexed eastern Poland and divided former Polish lands between Soviet Belarus and Soviet Ukraine.  

1939年，根据纳粹-苏联条约的秘密议定书，苏联吞并了波兰东部，并在苏联白俄罗斯和苏联乌克兰之间划分了前波兰土地。  

The people living in these lands were mobilised into Soviet society under the banner of what the historian Jan T Gross has [called](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691096032/revolution-from-abroad) a ‘revolution from abroad’.  

生活在这些土地上的人们在历史学家格罗斯（Jan T Gross）所说的 "来自国外的革命 "的旗帜下被动员进入苏维埃社会。  

The Soviets also mobilised the rhetoric of national liberation: calling their annexation of eastern Poland a ‘reunification’, arguing that they were reuniting historically Ukrainian and Belarusian people to historically Ukrainian and Belarusian lands – and, most importantly, under the leadership of Moscow.  

苏联还动员了民族解放的言论：把他们对波兰东部的吞并称为 "统一"，认为他们是在把历史上的乌克兰人和白俄罗斯人统一到历史上的乌克兰和白俄罗斯的土地上--而且，最重要的是，在莫斯科的领导下。

Yet behind this rhetoric of ‘reunification’ was a recognition by the Soviet state that these people were quite different from their ‘Slavic brothers’ to the East. At times, this recognition was acknowledged and emphasised. Soviet propaganda materials [portrayed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44113489) these peoples as being different because they had been oppressed by the previous Polish regime and that soon these differences would fade away once they had been transformed by Sovietisation.  

然而，在这种 "统一 "的言辞背后，苏联国家承认，这些人与他们在东方的 "斯拉夫兄弟 "有很大的不同。有时，这种认识得到了承认和强调。苏联的宣传材料将这些民族描绘成不同的，因为他们曾被以前的波兰政权压迫，一旦他们被苏维埃化改造，这些差异很快就会消失了。  

But Soviet authorities were also worried about the influence of newly Soviet peoples on their Soviet ‘brothers’, especially in Ukraine.  

但苏联当局也担心新苏维埃人民对其苏联 "兄弟 "的影响，特别是在乌克兰。  

Moscow’s perception of Ukraine as disloyal preceded the 1939 annexation – it was a suspicion that led to harsher repressions against those accused of Ukrainian nationalism than of Russian nationalism, for [example](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20171121). But with the new lands added to Ukraine, the threat was deemed starker.  

在1939年的吞并之前，莫斯科就认为乌克兰是不忠的--例如，这种怀疑导致对那些被指控为乌克兰民族主义的人进行比俄罗斯民族主义更严厉的镇压。但随着乌克兰新增的土地，这种威胁被认为更加明显。  

Thus, in western Ukraine beginning in 1939, Soviet authorities confronted their worries about subversive Ukrainian political activity with the violent tactics that were hallmarks of Stalinism: mass surveillance, arrests, deportations and executions.  

因此，从1939年开始，在乌克兰西部，苏维埃当局用斯大林主义特有的暴力手段来面对他们对乌克兰颠覆性政治活动的担忧：大规模监视、逮捕、驱逐和处决。  

The nature of this suspicion has been summed up in the saying: ‘When they cut fingernails in Moscow, they cut fingers in Kyiv, and chop off the entire hand in L’viv.’  

这种怀疑的性质被总结为一句话：'在莫斯科剪指甲，在基辅剪手指，在利沃夫砍掉整个手。

But, paradoxically, the singling out of L’viv and its west-Ukrainian surroundings as particularly dangerous could also lead to concessions, not just violent crackdowns.  

但是，矛盾的是，将利沃夫及其西乌克兰周边地区单独列为特别危险的地区，也可能导致让步，而不仅仅是暴力镇压。  

Observing the religiousness of its newly Soviet population in western Ukraine, Soviet authorities feared the potential for religious institutions to mobilise anti-Soviet sentiment in the population.  

苏联当局观察到其在乌克兰西部的新苏维埃人口的宗教性，担心宗教机构有可能在人口中调动反苏情绪。  

Recognising that the Soviet state did not have the capacity to fully repress religious life in western Ukraine, they began to explore how to use religion for their own ends.  

认识到苏维埃国家没有能力完全压制乌克兰西部的宗教生活，他们开始探索如何利用宗教来达到自己的目的。  

Soviet authorities found that religious institutions could be useful partners in supporting the idea of ‘reunification’ as a justification for territorial annexation.  

苏联当局发现，宗教机构可以成为支持 "统一 "理念的有用伙伴，作为吞并领土的理由。

State control of Orthodoxy straddled the blurred boundaries between foreign and domestic policy  

国家对东正教的控制跨越了外交和国内政策之间模糊的界限

At the root of the ‘reunification’ narrative was the idea that these formerly Polish lands were historically Ukrainian and historically tied to Russia.  

统一 "说法的根源在于，这些原为波兰的土地在历史上是乌克兰的，在历史上与俄罗斯有联系。  

While the Soviets did not initially acknowledge this, this narrative depended on the historical role of a shared religious tradition, specifically Eastern Orthodoxy, in forming and sustaining these ties.  

虽然苏联人最初并不承认这一点，但这种说法取决于共同的宗教传统，特别是东正教，在形成和维持这些关系方面的历史作用。  

Soon, however, the Soviets realised that a pragmatic approach to religion could allow them to buttress their claims to western Ukraine. The idea that these lands on the western borderlands ought to be ruled by Russia could be justified with the presence of Orthodox churches.  

但很快，苏联人意识到，对宗教采取务实的态度可以使他们支持对乌克兰西部的要求。这些位于西部边境地区的土地应该由俄罗斯统治的想法可以用东正教教堂的存在来证明。

Thus, beginning in 1939, the Soviet state began the process of formally transferring churches in this region to Moscow’s spiritual jurisdiction and re-opening them with Russian Orthodox priests.  

因此，从1939年开始，苏维埃国家开始将这一地区的教堂正式移交给莫斯科的精神管辖，并由俄罗斯东正教的牧师重新开放这些教堂。  

The perceived successes that came out of this 1939 experiment in the western borderlands laid the groundwork for the Soviet-wide revival of the Russian Orthodox Church that began in 1943.  

1939年在西部边境地区进行的这次试验所取得的明显成功，为1943年开始的苏联全境俄罗斯东正教的复兴奠定了基础。  

In the newly Soviet western borderlands, state control of Orthodoxy straddled the blurred boundaries between foreign and domestic policy, using religion to bring borderland peoples in, as well as extending Soviet influence outside, its own borders.  

在新成立的苏维埃西部边境地区，国家对东正教的控制跨越了外交和国内政策之间的模糊界限，利用宗教将边境地区的人民带入，并将苏维埃的影响扩展到其边界之外。  

In a letter from the newly appointed head of the Committee for the Affairs of the Russian Orthodox Church, Georgii Karpov explained as much to Nikita Khrushchev, then head of the Ukrainian Communist Party:  

在新任命的俄罗斯东正教会事务委员会主任格奥尔基-卡尔波夫的一封信中，他向当时的乌克兰共产党领导人尼基塔-赫鲁晓夫作了同样的解释。

> We have determined that the Russian Orthodox Church can and should play a role … in Ukraine, in Belarus, in Lithuania, in Latvia, and abroad.  
> 
> 我们已经确定，俄罗斯东正教能够而且应该在乌克兰、白俄罗斯、立陶宛、拉脱维亚和国外......发挥作用。

Creating an official, recognised Russian Orthodox Church provided a blueprint for other religious groups in the USSR during the Second World War, often with the same goals in mind.  

创建一个官方认可的俄罗斯东正教会，为二战期间苏联的其他宗教团体提供了一个蓝本，这些团体往往有着相同的目标。  

Shortly after creating the Council for the Affairs of the Russian Orthodox Church, Stalin created the Council for the Affairs of Religious Cults to oversee newly revived religious institutions for other religious traditions, including Islam and Judaism.  

在成立俄罗斯东正教事务委员会后不久，斯大林又成立了宗教邪教事务委员会，以监督包括伊斯兰教和犹太教在内的其他宗教传统的新复兴的宗教机构。

Not all religions were granted the chance for a regulatory model. Certain faiths were deemed too dangerous to the Soviet order to be permitted an official structure within the Soviet Union, leaving few options for believers and clergy associated with these communities.  

并非所有的宗教都获得了建立监管模式的机会。某些信仰被认为对苏联秩序过于危险，不允许在苏联境内建立官方机构，因此与这些社区有关的信徒和神职人员几乎没有选择。  

Still, these groups were not wiped out – instead they [managed](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/dissent-on-the-margins-9780199945535?cc=us&lang=en&) to navigate a precarious existence on the margins of Soviet society.  

不过，这些群体并没有被消灭--相反，他们设法在苏联社会的边缘地带渡过了不稳定的生活。

The decision to refuse certain religious groups the chance for state recognition, while granting the opportunity to others, gets at one of the central questions raised by the wartime shift in religious policy: could something as complex as religious life be institutionalised, regulated and surveilled to the degree that it could exist to serve the Soviet order?  

拒绝某些宗教团体获得国家承认的机会，而给予其他宗教团体机会的决定，触及了战时宗教政策转变所带来的一个核心问题：像宗教生活这样复杂的东西能否被制度化、规范化和监督化，使其能够为苏联秩序服务？  

Or, put simply, was Stalin’s Soviet state as powerful as it thought it was?  

或者，简单地说，斯大林的苏维埃国家是否像它认为的那样强大？

Over time, the answer appeared to be no.  

随着时间的推移，答案似乎是否定的。  

Reports from the officials overseeing religious life are filled with evidence that the experiments with religion were going awry: believers rejecting the authority of ‘official’ clergy in favour of those deemed enemies of the state operating in the underground, religious practices deemed ‘anti-Soviet’ nevertheless occurring in official sacred spaces, historical churches restored by the state to hold services being avoided in favour of basements, woods and rivers where believers felt their surroundings to be more sacred, and reports of Soviet-approved clergy using their platforms to denigrate their government.  

来自监督宗教生活的官员的报告充满了宗教实验出现问题的证据：信徒们拒绝 "官方 "神职人员的权威，而支持那些被认为是国家敌人的地下活动，被认为是 "反苏 "的宗教活动却在官方的神圣场所发生，被国家修复的历史教堂用来举行仪式，而避开地下室、树林和河流，信徒们认为那里的环境更神圣，还有报告称苏联批准的神职人员利用其平台诋毁其政府。

The reports show us that, while the Soviet state was not asserting the full control over religion it wished to, they were changing it.  

这些报告向我们表明，虽然苏联国家没有对宗教实行它所希望的全面控制，但他们正在改变宗教。  

In these reports, bureaucrats are parsing out the details of sanctioned religious life and making determinations about what was acceptable in the atheist Soviet Union.  

在这些报告中，官僚们正在解析受认可的宗教生活的细节，并确定在无神论的苏联，什么是可以接受的。  

Whether believers or clergy chose to engage with Soviet-sanctioned religious institutions or not, they too were making determinations about how their own ideas of the sacred did or did not match up with what official religious life allowed.  

无论信徒或神职人员是否选择与苏联批准的宗教机构接触，他们也在确定自己的神圣观念是否与官方宗教生活所允许的相一致。  

Underground religious life and official religious life began to develop in conversation with the other. The lines between the two were not always as fixed as believers or the state wanted them to be.  

地下宗教生活和官方宗教生活开始在相互对话中发展。两者之间的界限并不总是像信徒或国家希望的那样固定。

Those who refused transfer from the Greek Catholic Church faced arrest, deportation and death in the gulag  

那些拒绝调离希腊天主教会的人面临着逮捕、驱逐出境和在古拉格的死亡。

One particularly ambitious experiment with religion undertaken by the Soviet state in western Ukraine helps illustrate these points.  

苏联国家在乌克兰西部进行的一项特别雄心勃勃的宗教实验有助于说明这些问题。  

When the Soviet state began sending Orthodox clergy to annexed Polish territories in 1939 to enforce their narrative of ‘reunification’, they had to confront the fact that not all of this region’s Slavic population were Orthodox. In much of western Ukraine, they were Catholic.  

当苏维埃国家在1939年开始向被吞并的波兰领土派遣东正教神职人员，以推行他们的 "统一 "说法时，他们不得不面对这样一个事实：这个地区的斯拉夫人口并非都是东正教徒。在乌克兰西部的大部分地区，他们是天主教徒。  

In the city of L’viv and its surrounding region (historically known as Galicia), the majority of Ukrainians were affiliated with the Greek Catholic Church, a Church that practised Eastern-rite Christianity similar to Orthodoxy but that recognised the authority of the Pope and remained under the jurisdiction of the Vatican.  

在利沃夫市及其周边地区（历史上称为加利西亚），大多数乌克兰人都隶属于希腊天主教会，这个教会奉行类似于东正教的东方式基督教，但承认教皇的权威，并仍受梵蒂冈的管辖。  

The Greek Catholic Church’s presence in this region, dating back to the 16th century, called into question the idea that all being annexed to the Soviet empire had once been unified under one Orthodox civilisation. Historically, members of the Greek Catholic Church often used the existence of their Church to show that Ukraine had a history separate from Russia.  

希腊天主教会在这一地区的存在可以追溯到16世纪，这使人们对所有被并入苏维埃帝国的地区曾经统一在一个东正教文明之下的想法产生了怀疑。历史上，希腊天主教会的成员经常利用他们教会的存在来表明乌克兰有一个独立于俄罗斯的历史。  

Indeed, Greek Catholic clergy and Greek Catholic believers were some of the most important figures in the growth of Ukrainian nationalism.  

事实上，希腊天主教神职人员和希腊天主教信徒是乌克兰民族主义发展中的一些最重要的人物。

And so, in western Ukraine, the Soviets did not just establish an official Russian Orthodox Church but also arranged a forced religious transfer from the Greek Catholic Church to the Russian Orthodox Church for the Church’s 3 million believers and hundreds of clergy. Those who refused faced arrest, deportation and death in the gulag. Many who agreed to the transfer did so under incredible duress, including physical torture and threats against their families.  

于是，在乌克兰西部，苏联不仅建立了一个正式的俄罗斯东正教会，而且还安排该教会的300万信徒和数百名神职人员被迫从希腊天主教会转移到俄罗斯东正教会。那些拒绝的人面临着逮捕、驱逐和在古拉格的死亡。许多同意转移的人是在难以置信的胁迫下同意的，包括身体上的折磨和对家人的威胁。  

Some who refused went into hiding and tried to preserve the Greek Catholic Church in the underground.  

一些拒绝的人躲了起来，试图在地下保存希腊天主教会。

The decision to oversee this mass religious transfer from one Church to another was a particularly extreme manifestation of what the Soviet state hoped to accomplish with official religion.  

监督这种从一个教会到另一个教会的大规模宗教转移的决定，是苏联国家希望通过官方宗教实现的一个特别极端的表现。  

In this case, it was not about a state-managed infrastructure for religion, but a direct intervention into the confessional belonging of individual believers to assign them to a religious institution that was more in line with Soviet state goals.  

在这种情况下，这不是关于国家管理的宗教基础设施，而是直接干预个别信徒的信仰归属，将他们分配到更符合苏联国家目标的宗教机构。  

To be sure, there was an important historical [precedent](https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9780875804071/the-western-front-of-the-eastern-church/#bookTabs=1) to this transfer. The Greek Catholic Church itself was established as a way to bring Orthodox believers into the Catholic world in the 16th century. Beginning in the 19th century, Orthodox activists – with backing from what was then imperial Russia – arranged forced transfers of Greek Catholics to the Russian Orthodox Church in the name of ‘restoring’ Orthodoxy to these peoples and lands.  

可以肯定的是，这种转移有一个重要的历史先例。希腊天主教会本身就是在16世纪作为将东正教信徒引入天主教世界的一种方式而建立的。从19世纪开始，东正教活动家--在当时的帝国俄罗斯的支持下--以在这些民族和土地上 "恢复 "东正教的名义，安排将希腊天主教徒强制转移到俄罗斯的东正教会。

In this way, the Soviet approach to the Greek Catholic Church was informed by the goals and strategies of its predecessor, imperial Russia.  

这样一来，苏联对希腊天主教会的态度就受到了其前身--帝国俄国的目标和策略的影响。  

Indeed, as much as the Soviet Union put itself forward as a radical break from the old regime, in trying to make sense of its diverse religious landscape, Soviet officials drew on what the scholars Jane Burbank and Fred Cooper [define](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691152363/empires-in-world-history) as an ‘an imperial repertoire’, what leaders imagined was possible based on the past practices and constraints of their imperial ancestor.  

事实上，就像苏联把自己说成是与旧政权彻底决裂一样，在试图理解其多样化的宗教景观时，苏联官员借鉴了学者简-伯班克和弗雷德-库珀所定义的 "帝国剧目"，即领导人根据其帝国祖先过去的做法和限制所想象的可能性。  

For imperial Russian officials, as well as Soviet ones, forcing a religious transfer from one Church to another allowed religious life to justify conquest with a narrative of national reunification and territorial restoration.  

对于帝国时期的俄罗斯官员以及苏联官员来说，强迫宗教从一个教会转移到另一个教会，可以让宗教生活以国家统一和领土恢复的叙述来证明征服的合理性。

As the head of the local Communist Party in L’viv in Ukraine explained in his report to his superiors about the status of the forced religious transfer:  

正如乌克兰利沃夫地方共产党负责人在向其上级报告强迫宗教转移的状况时解释的那样。

> Reunification should not be carried out in only a formal fashion, but in a way so reunified priests show their devotion to Orthodoxy and inculcate the believer part of the population with love for their fellow Orthodox – Russians, Ukrainians, and other peoples of the Soviet Union.  
> 
> 统一不应该只在形式上进行，而应该以这样的方式进行，即统一后的牧师显示他们对东正教的奉献，并向人口中的信徒部分灌输对其东正教同胞--俄罗斯人、乌克兰人和苏联其他民族的爱。  

Outside of western Ukraine in the decades following the Second World War, the realisation that the instrumentalisation of religion was not working led to a reversal of the tolerant wartime policies.  

在第二次世界大战后的几十年里，在乌克兰西部，人们意识到宗教的工具化并不奏效，导致战时的宽容政策发生逆转。  

In Stalin’s later years and under the leadership of his successor, Khrushchev, many of the reopened sacred spaces were shuttered again.  

在斯大林的晚年，在其继任者赫鲁晓夫的领导下，许多重新开放的圣地又被关闭了。  

The Council for the Affairs of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Council for the Affairs of Religious Cults found that their requests for funding and personnel were routinely denied. Official clergy came under suspicion, their loyalty to the Soviet state called into doubt.  

俄罗斯东正教会事务委员会和宗教邪教事务委员会发现，他们的资金和人员请求经常被拒绝。官方神职人员受到怀疑，他们对苏维埃国家的忠诚度受到怀疑。  

Khrushchev launched renewed campaigns to promote atheism.  

赫鲁晓夫再次发起运动，宣传无神论。

But in some places the experiment continued on. In western Ukraine, the Russian Orthodox Church justified its presence as a bulwark against the underground Greek Catholic Church and the associations with anti-Soviet Ukrainian nationalism that came with it.  

但在一些地方，这种试验仍在继续。在乌克兰西部，俄罗斯东正教会认为自己的存在是对抗地下希腊天主教会和与之相关的反苏维埃乌克兰民族主义的堡垒。  

While churches closed across the USSR, Russian Orthodox priests in western Ukraine successfully petitioned for theirs to stay open. By the time the Soviet Union collapsed, [20 per cent](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2499857) of its surviving Russian Orthodox Churches were located in the Galician region of western Ukraine – the epicentre of the religious transfer and a place that had been mostly Catholic before the arrival of Soviet power.  

当整个苏联的教堂关闭时，乌克兰西部的俄罗斯东正教牧师成功地为他们的教堂继续开放请愿。到苏联解体时，其幸存的俄罗斯东正教教堂中有20%位于乌克兰西部的加利西亚地区--这是宗教转移的中心，在苏联政权到来之前，这个地方大部分是天主教。  

The example of western Ukraine demonstrates that, in places where official religion was seen as playing the role the Soviet state wanted it to play, official religion survived – long into the postwar era.  

乌克兰西部的例子表明，在那些官方宗教被视为发挥了苏联国家希望它发挥的作用的地方，官方宗教幸存了下来--一直到战后时代。

Reflecting on the legacy of this intervention into religious life, it is easy to dismiss the state-formulated Russian Orthodox Church in western Ukraine and other forms of official religious life as purely an imposition.  

反思这种对宗教生活的干预的遗留问题，我们很容易将乌克兰西部由国家制定的俄罗斯东正教会和其他形式的官方宗教生活视为纯粹的强加。  

But this ignores the experience of those who found meaning in the official Russian Orthodox Church, who prayed in its chapels, who took Communion from its priests, and who attended the Divine Liturgy – whether reluctantly or not.  

但这忽略了那些在官方的俄罗斯东正教会中找到意义的人的经历，他们在其小教堂中祈祷，从其牧师那里领取圣餐，并参加神圣的礼仪--无论是否不情愿地。  

In trying to instrumentalise religion, in western Ukraine the Soviet state changed how religious institutions were viewed by believers and non-believers alike.  

在试图将宗教工具化的过程中，在乌克兰西部，苏维埃国家改变了信徒和非信徒对宗教机构的看法。  

The mere presence of an official Russian Orthodox Church associated with the Soviet state created associations between Soviet belonging, Russian imperialism and Ukrainian nationalism that shaped the experiences of believers then, and continue to shape perceptions of religious institutions in today’s Ukraine.  

仅仅是一个与苏联国家有关的官方俄罗斯东正教会的存在，就在苏联的归属感、俄罗斯帝国主义和乌克兰民族主义之间产生了关联，这影响了当时信徒们的经历，并继续影响着今天乌克兰人对宗教机构的看法。

Bohdan felt that he was able to preserve religious life, even under less-than-ideal conditions  

博丹认为，即使在不太理想的条件下，他也能保持宗教生活。

Evidence of this impact can be found in the recollections of those who experienced it. A series of oral histories conducted in the early 1990s by what is now Ukraine’s Institute of Church History reflect the nuances of the imposition of Orthodoxy.  

这种影响的证据可以在经历过这种影响的人的回忆中找到。现在的乌克兰教会历史研究所在20世纪90年代初进行的一系列口述历史反映了东正教强加的细微差别。  

In an interview in 1993, Bohdan, a Greek Catholic priest who was forced by the authorities to join the Orthodox Church, reflects on his decision to join the official church, noting:  

在1993年的一次采访中，被当局强迫加入东正教的希腊天主教牧师博丹对他加入官方教会的决定进行了反思，他指出："我的决定是。

> I knew what the Bolshevik authorities \[were capable of\] … all the churches could be closed … History will say, will judge whether what we did was right or not right. But there was one goal: to protect the faith and protect the Church.  
> 
> 我知道布尔什维克当局\[的能力\]......所有的教堂都可能被关闭......历史会说，会判断我们所做的是对还是错。但是有一个目标：保护信仰，保护教会。

Reflecting on his time as an ‘official’ priest, Bohdan felt that he was able to preserve religious life, even under less-than-ideal conditions.  

反思他作为 "官方 "牧师的时间，博丹觉得他能够维护宗教生活，即使在不太理想的条件下也是如此。  

Another person interviewed in the series, Anna, makes a similar justification for her decision to attend a church that was nominally Russian Orthodox, yet explained that, when she prayed, she noted in her prayers that she was still a Greek Catholic:  

该系列报道中的另一位受访者安娜为她决定参加一个名义上是俄罗斯东正教的教堂做了类似的辩解，然而她解释说，当她祈祷时，她在祷告中指出她仍然是一个希腊天主教徒。

> I went to the \[Russian Orthodox church\] … I said ‘God … I did not convert. I am praying exactly the way my mother taught me.  
> 
> 我去了\[俄罗斯东正教堂\]......我说'上帝......我没有皈依。我完全按照我母亲教我的方式祈祷。

The space of official religious life allowed people like Anna to carve out a spiritual existence under official atheism – an opportunity not available in other times and places in Soviet history, but in ways the Soviets likely did not anticipate.  

官方宗教生活的空间使像安娜这样的人能够在官方无神论下开拓出一种精神生活--这是苏联历史上其他时间和地点所没有的机会，但其方式可能是苏联人没有预料到的。

Both Anna and Bohdan began openly attending Greek Catholic churches when the Soviet Union collapsed and it was safe and legal to do so.  

当苏联解体后，安娜和博丹都开始公开参加希腊天主教教堂的活动，这样做是安全和合法的。  

For them and others interviewed, the state’s association with Orthodoxy meant that Orthodoxy would become associated with Moscow’s imperialist goals for Ukraine.  

对他们和其他受访者来说，国家与东正教的联系意味着东正教将与莫斯科对乌克兰的帝国主义目标相联系。  

Another woman interviewed, Nina, mentioned that, before the Soviet occupation, she had no negative feelings toward Orthodoxy but now it will be forever associated with ‘Bolshevism’.  

另一位受访妇女尼娜提到，在苏联占领之前，她对东正教没有任何负面情绪，但现在它将永远与 "布尔什维克主义 "联系在一起。

But other former Greek Catholics continued to attend Orthodox churches in the 1990s, feeling a connection to the sacred space and the priest associated with the parish during Soviet times, even as an era of religious freedom was ushered in.  

但其他前希腊天主教徒在20世纪90年代继续参加东正教教堂，他们感到与神圣的空间和苏联时期与教区有关的牧师有联系，即使迎来了宗教自由时代。  

It is no coincidence that it was these Orthodox communities that became instrumental in the movement for an autocephalous (independent) Ukrainian Orthodox Church.  

正是这些东正教社区在争取建立自体（独立）乌克兰东正教的运动中发挥了作用，这并非巧合。  

While they found resonance in the Orthodox churches established by the Soviet state, their experience with official religion meant that they did not want the Orthodox Church to continue to serve the goals of Moscow.  

虽然他们在苏联国家建立的东正教会中找到了共鸣，但他们对官方宗教的经验意味着他们不希望东正教会继续为莫斯科的目标服务。

There is another critical legacy of the Soviet experiment with official religion that lives on.  

苏联官方宗教实验的另一个重要遗产是继续存在的。  

Many of the men who serve as hierarchs in some of the most important religious institutions in the former Soviet Union received their theological education and clerical training in the strange world of Soviet official religion.  

在前苏联一些最重要的宗教机构中担任主教的许多人都是在苏联官方宗教的奇怪世界中接受的神学教育和牧师培训。  

They attended Soviet-sanctioned seminaries and led liturgies in state-owned sacred properties.  

他们在苏联批准的神学院学习，并在国有的圣地主持礼仪。  

For example, Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church today, attended a Soviet-approved seminary in Leningrad and was selected by Soviet authorities to represent the USSR to the World Council of Churches as the representative from the Moscow Patriarchate, a position he held from the early 1970s into the ’90s.  

例如，今天俄罗斯东正教会的领袖基里尔牧首曾在列宁格勒一所苏联批准的神学院就读，并被苏联当局选为代表苏联参加世界教会理事会的莫斯科牧首区代表，他在1970年代初至90年代担任这一职务。

Often when observers bring up this information, it elicits a great deal of hand-wringing and condemnation over the ties between official religion and the KGB.  

当观察家们提出这一信息时，往往会引起人们对官方宗教和克格勃之间关系的大量抱怨和谴责。  

As these men preside over ceremonies to commemorate the sacrifices of Soviet martyrs, could it be the case that they were the ones responsible for informing on them? It is clear that the tale of official religion is more [complex](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9781501757693-012/html) than that.  

当这些人主持纪念苏联烈士牺牲的仪式时，会不会是他们负责告发这些烈士？很显然，官方宗教的故事比这更复杂。  

Memoirs and oral histories of those involved in official religion have described their relationship with Soviet officialdom, including the secret police, as a negotiation between what needed to be sacrificed to maintain a legalised existence, and what lines they would not cross in order to maintain their faith and dignity.  

参与官方宗教的人的回忆录和口述历史描述了他们与苏联官方的关系，包括秘密警察，作为一种谈判，在需要牺牲什么来维持合法的存在，以及为了保持他们的信仰和尊严，他们不会跨越什么界限。  

In this way, the official clergy resembled many other Soviet people faced with a series of impossible choices.  

这样一来，官方神职人员就像许多其他面临一系列不可能选择的苏联人一样。

Religious life did not just exist on the margins of the Soviet Union or in the homes of dissidents  

宗教生活并不仅仅存在于苏联的边缘地区或持不同政见者的家中。

Having this shared experience clearly informs the role that religious institutions play in formerly Soviet countries.  

有了这种共同的经验，就能清楚地了解宗教机构在前苏联国家所发挥的作用。  

It is this context that helps explain the outsized role religious institutions have played in Russia’s justification for its war against Ukraine, especially in the wake of the full-scale invasion of February 2022. Over his time as Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin has cultivated a close relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church and the leader of the Moscow Patriarchate, Patriarch Kirill, who has held that post since 2009.  

正是这种背景有助于解释宗教机构在俄罗斯对乌克兰发动战争的理由中所发挥的巨大作用，尤其是在2022年2月的全面入侵之后。在担任俄罗斯领导人期间，弗拉基米尔-普京与俄罗斯东正教会以及莫斯科牧首府的领导人基里尔牧首培养了密切的关系，基里尔牧首自2009年以来一直担任这一职务。  

The relationship between the two institutions began as mutually beneficial. The Church was a key legitimiser of Putin’s ‘traditional values’ agenda that helped buttress Putin’s support, even as Russia’s economy began an inauspicious downturn.  

这两个机构之间的关系开始是互利的。教会是普京 "传统价值观 "议程的主要合法化者，即使在俄罗斯经济开始不景气的情况下，也有助于巩固普京的支持。  

In exchange, Putin ensured that the Church could control lucrative properties and state assets in the name of post-Soviet property restitution.  

作为交换，普京确保教会能够以后苏联财产归还的名义控制有利可图的财产和国有资产。

In 2014, when Russia sought a justification for annexing Crimea, Putin offered a familiar narrative: the idea that his territorial grab should be seen as a restoration of the Russian Orthodox world, using the Church to legitimise his worldview. In February 2022 when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin returned to this framing.  

2014年，当俄罗斯为吞并克里米亚寻找理由时，普京提出了一个熟悉的说法：他的领土掠夺应被视为俄罗斯东正教世界的恢复，利用教会使其世界观合法化。2022年2月，当俄罗斯发动对乌克兰的全面入侵时，普京又回到了这个框架。  

Not only has Patriarch Kirill supported this narrative but he has even gone a step further, endorsing the war as being fought for a just cause, the unity of the Russian Orthodox world, and referring to Russian soldiers killed as martyrs in this holy war.  

基里尔牧首不仅支持这种说法，而且他甚至更进一步，认可这场战争是为了一个正义的事业，为了俄罗斯东正教世界的团结，并称在这场圣战中被杀的俄罗斯士兵为殉道者。

Whether Patriarch Kirill truly believes this or not, it is clear that his own background in the official Russian Orthodox Church overseen by the Soviet state informs his decision to support the war in Ukraine.  

无论基里尔牧首是否真的相信这一点，很明显，他自己在苏联国家监督下的俄罗斯官方东正教会的背景为他支持乌克兰战争的决定提供了依据。  

The idea that religious institutions exist to serve the political goals of the state can be traced back to the complexities of Soviet life.  

宗教机构的存在是为了服务于国家的政治目标，这种想法可以追溯到复杂的苏联生活。

It is wrong to ignore the Soviet attempts to reconcile with religion, or dismiss them as temporary measures. The Soviet Union’s legacy in the spiritual lives of millions of people is much more than a story of repression.  

忽视苏联与宗教和解的尝试，或将其视为临时措施，都是错误的。苏联在数百万人的精神生活中留下的遗产，远不止是一个镇压的故事。  

Religious life did not just exist on the margins of the Soviet Union or in the homes of dissidents and martyrs. It was a sphere that the state tried to control and use for its own ends.  

宗教生活不仅仅存在于苏联的边缘地区，也不仅仅存在于异议人士和烈士的家中。它是一个国家试图控制并为其自身目的而使用的领域。  

And while the Soviet experiment with religion may not have accomplished what it set out to do, the values and assumptions behind it persist.  

虽然苏联的宗教实验可能没有完成它的目标，但它背后的价值观和假设仍然存在。  

They persist in how post-Soviet leaders mobilise religious ties to claim people and lands, how believers recognise the political implications of their religious affiliations, and in the sermons delivered by priests sent to annexed territories.  

它们持续存在于后苏联领导人如何动员宗教关系来要求人民和土地，信徒们如何认识到他们的宗教归属的政治影响，以及被派往被吞并领土的牧师所做的布道中。  

Contrary to stereotypes, the religious life of the Soviet Union remains alive and active in the world.  

与刻板印象相反，苏联的宗教生活在世界范围内仍然是活跃的。
