When you’re reading a book or watching a TV show, it’s often easy to see why things are going wrong between the characters.  

当你读一本书或看一个电视节目时，往往很容易看到为什么人物之间的事情会出现问题。

“Why don’t they just be honest with each other?” we shout at the screen as the protagonists bicker (_again_) because of an entirely avoidable misunderstanding.  

"他们为什么不对彼此诚实呢？"当主角们因为一个完全可以避免的误解而争吵（再次）时，我们对着屏幕大喊。

“She should leave him,” we say, as a character puts up with an emotionally abusive boyfriend.  

"她应该离开他，"我们说，因为一个角色忍受了一个情感上受虐待的男友。

“He should just tell his boss to screw himself,” we insist when we read about someone struggling under the daily grind of a soul-sucking job.  

"他应该告诉他的老板，让他自己去死吧。"当我们读到有人在每天的工作中挣扎时，我们坚持认为，这是在吸食灵魂的工作中挣扎。

The fact is that we’re experts when it comes to giving advice to _other_ people. Most of us, on some level, know what’s good for people. We know what a good life should look like. You probably already know what food you _should_ eat and what habits you _should_ be developing. And yet we talk out of both sides of our mouth. We tell friends to do things we never do ourselves. We criticize TV characters for doing things we did this morning.  

事实是，在给别人提供建议方面，我们是专家。我们中的大多数人，在某种程度上，知道什么对人有好处。我们知道一个好的生活应该是什么样子的。你可能已经知道你应该吃什么食物，你应该培养什么习惯。然而，我们却两面三刀地说话。我们告诉朋友做我们自己从不做的事情。我们批评电视人物做我们今天早上做的事情。

Why? It has to do with a curious blinkering we have when it comes to self-reflection. If you want to beat it, perhaps it’s time to consider Solomon’s Paradox. Knowing its secrets might help you.  

为什么？这与我们在自我反省时的一种奇怪的眨眼现象有关。如果你想打败它，也许是时候考虑所罗门悖论了。了解它的秘密可能会帮助你。

## Wise King Solomon  

聪明的所罗门王

King Solomon of ancient Israel was known the world over for his wisdom and fair justice. His kingdom was the wealthiest and most peaceful that had ever been known.  

古代以色列的国王所罗门因其智慧和公平正义而闻名于世。他的王国是有史以来最富裕、最和平的王国。  

One day, two women appeared presenting Solomon with a problem: They both claimed to be the mother of an infant.  

有一天，有两个女人出现，给所罗门提出了一个问题：她们都声称自己是一个婴儿的母亲。

Since no ancient king holds court without a weapon, Solomon drew out his sword and said, “I shall cut this child in two, so you both shall have your fair share.  

由于古代的国王上朝时没有不带武器的，所以所罗门拔出他的剑说："我要把这个孩子切成两半，这样你们两个人都会有自己公平的份额。  

” Aghast, the true mother fell to her knees, begging the child to be spared and given to the other, imposter woman. Solomon could see who the true mother was and he gave her the infant.  

"真正的母亲大吃一惊，跪在地上，恳求放过这个孩子，把他交给另一个冒牌的女人。所罗门看清了谁是真正的母亲，他把婴儿交给了她。

King Solomon is legendary for his wisdom. His name is synonymous with good kingship. Yet, in his own life, he was notoriously shambolic.  

所罗门王因其智慧而富有传奇色彩。他的名字是优秀王权的代名词。然而，在他自己的生活中，他是出了名的乱七八糟。  

His poor parenting gave rise to one of the cruelest tyrants in the Bible, his son, Rehoboam, who turned Judah into a pit of abomination and sin.  

他糟糕的教养方式产生了《圣经》中最残酷的暴君之一，他的儿子雷霍波安，他把犹大变成了一个可憎和罪恶的坑。  

Solomon had many pagan wives and concubines, with a likely host of illegitimate children. He was profligate and extravagant, and gave little thought to the temperate, sensible life.  

所罗门有许多异教徒的妻子和妻妾，很可能还有许多私生子。他挥霍无度，穷奢极欲，很少考虑有节制的、合理的生活。  

For all his sagacity when it came to others’ affairs, Solomon was woefully myopic when it came to his own.  

尽管所罗门在处理别人的事务时很有智慧，但在处理自己的事务时却严重地近视。

## Solomon’s paradox  

所罗门的悖论

In 2014, [a paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24916084/) from psychologists Igor Grossman and Ethan Kross introduced the idea of Solomon’s paradox. Their research revealed two things.  

2014年，心理学家Igor Grossman和Ethan Kross的一篇论文提出了所罗门悖论的观点。他们的研究揭示了两件事。  

One was that people “display wiser reasoning… about another person’s problems compared with their own.  

其中之一是，人们 "对另一个人的问题......与自己的问题相比，显示出更明智的推理。  

” In other words, there’s a widespread social cognitive bias that means we are much better at dealing with other people’s lives and problems than our own.  

"换句话说，有一个广泛的社会认知偏见，这意味着我们在处理其他人的生活和问题时比自己的要好得多。  

Second, Grossman and Kross noted that when we try to eliminate self-immersion — in other words, when we try to distance ourselves from our own problems — we somehow are much better at making sensible decisions.  

第二，格罗斯曼和克罗斯指出，当我们试图消除自我沉浸--换句话说，当我们试图与自己的问题保持距离--我们在某种程度上更能做出明智的决定。

In all the studies that have gone on to prove this (and it has been proven [over](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28972825/) and [over](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28933874/) again), we find in the [literature](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286508117_The_Scientific_Study_of_Personal_Wisdom) discussion of two different types of wisdom. On the one hand, we have _general wisdom_, which is said to be interpersonal — between yourself and someone external to you. On the other hand, we have _personal wisdom_, which is intrapersonal — between yourself and your own affairs.  

在所有的研究中，我们发现在文献中对两种不同类型的智慧进行了讨论，以证明这一点（而且已经被反复证明）。一方面，我们有一般的智慧，据说是人际间的--在你自己和外部的人之间。另一方面，我们有个人智慧，它是个人内部的--在你自己和你自己的事务之间。

There’s an interesting philosophical and scientific debate to be had about the relationship between the two. We clearly have cases of people who are wise in either type of wisdom.  

关于这两者之间的关系，有一场有趣的哲学和科学辩论要进行。我们显然有在两种智慧中都有智慧的人的案例。  

King Solomon had general wisdom, for instance. We also know of people who are smart and sensible but awful at giving advice. But what factors connect the two?  

例如，所罗门王有一般的智慧。我们也知道有些人很聪明，很理智，但在提供建议方面却很糟糕。但是，是什么因素将这两者联系起来的呢？

The distinction between general and person wisdom ought to serve as a useful reminder against _ad hominem_ attacks (where we criticize someone’s character rather than their ideas). After all, someone like King Solomon can be very wise in certain things, but imbecilic in their personal affairs.  

一般智慧和个人智慧之间的区别应该作为一个有用的提醒，以反对人身攻击（即我们批评某人的性格而不是他们的想法）。毕竟，像所罗门王这样的人可能在某些事情上很有智慧，但在个人事务上却很低能。  

“Do as I say, not as I do” is a logically valid position. In fact, according to psychology, what we say is often better than what we do.  

"按我说的做，而不是按我做的做 "是一个逻辑上有效的立场。事实上，根据心理学，我们所说的往往比我们所做的更好。

## Ways to self-distance  

自我远离的方法

Solomon’s paradox teaches us, then, that if we want to give ourselves good advice, we ought to take a step back.  

那么，所罗门的悖论告诉我们，如果我们想给自己好的建议，我们应该退一步。  

If we want to make positive steps in improving who we are, we need to treat our own lives like we would characters in a book. Here are three ways we can do just that:  

如果我们想在改善自己的身份方面采取积极措施，我们需要像对待书中的人物一样对待自己的生活。以下是我们可以做到这一点的三种方法。

_**Talk to yourself  

自言自语**_

You’ll probably feel like an idiot, at first, so you’ll want to do this alone and in a safe space. Place an empty chair in front of you or just look at yourself in the mirror…and talk to yourself.  

一开始你可能会觉得自己像个白痴，所以你会想在一个安全的空间里单独做这件事。在你面前放一把空椅子，或者只是看着镜子里的自己......然后跟自己说话。  

Imagine you are a therapist and the person in the mirror is your client. Imagine you are a critic, and the empty chair is a character in a movie. Ask two questions, to start: “Why are you doing that?  

想象你是一个治疗师，镜子里的人是你的客户。想象你是一个批评家，而空椅子是电影中的一个角色。问两个问题，作为开始。"你为什么要这样做？  

” and “What can you do to help?”  

"和 "你能做什么来帮助我们？"

_**Journaling  

记事本**_

For those who have a low tolerance for cringe, and can’t do self-talk like this, try writing things down. Find a time in the day that’s good for you and write down what’s happened in the day or week.  

对于那些对畏难情绪容忍度低，不能像这样进行自我对话的人，可以尝试把事情写下来。在一天中找一个对你有好处的时间，写下一天或一周中发生的事情。  

Then take a step back for a good while. Read what you’ve written as if you’re reading a book. What advice would you give to yourself from what you’ve read.  

然后退后一步，好一阵子。阅读你写的东西，就像你在读一本书一样。从你所读的内容中，你会给自己什么建议。  

Obviously, this won’t work for instant problems — this one needs time — but re-reading journal entries is often as important as writing them down.  

显然，这对即时的问题不起作用--这个问题需要时间--但重读日记往往与写下它们一样重要。

_**Identify with someone else  

认同他人**_

Ask someone who knows you well — a close relative or a best friend — who they think you’re most like. It could be a TV character, an historical figure, or even another mutual connection.  

问问熟悉你的人--一个近亲或最好的朋友--他们认为你最像谁。这可能是一个电视人物，一个历史人物，甚至是另一个共同的关系。  

Then try to learn as much as you can about that person and see what advice you’d give them. Look to see what went well in their lives and what went wrong.  

然后尝试尽可能多地了解这个人，看看你会给他们什么建议。看看他们的生活中哪些地方做得好，哪些地方做得不好。  

Obviously, no two people are entirely alike, but this kind of third-person identification is often a useful distancing technique.  

显然，没有两个人是完全一样的，但这种第三人称的识别往往是一种有用的疏远技巧。

So, what kind of wisdom do you have?  

那么，你有什么样的智慧呢？  

Are you personally very sensible but give awful advice, or are you more like King Solomon — an expert when it comes to others, but a bumbling amateur when it comes to yourself?  

你个人是否非常理智，但却给出了糟糕的建议，或者你更像所罗门王--当涉及到别人时是个专家，但涉及到自己时却是个笨拙的外行？
