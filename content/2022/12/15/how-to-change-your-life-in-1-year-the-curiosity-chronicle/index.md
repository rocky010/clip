“Most people overestimate what they can achieve in a year and underestimate what they can achieve in ten years.” - Bill Gates

“大多数人都高估了他们一年能取得的成就，而低估了他们十年能取得的成就。” - 比尔盖茨

With all due respect to Bill, I'd like to propose an edit:

恕我直言，我想提出一个编辑建议：

“Most people overestimate what they can achieve in a **DAY** and underestimate what they can achieve in a **YEAR**.”

“大多数人都高估了他们一天能取得的成就， **而** 低估了他们 **一年** 能取得的成就。”

I don't know about you, but I find the idea of ten years wildly intimidating. I'm 31, so maybe it's just the fact that ten years represents one third of my life, or maybe it's my silent understanding that ten years ago I was doing embarrassingly immature stuff on a regular basis. Whatever the reason, I have a very tough time thinking on a ten year time horizon.

我不了解你，但我发现十年的想法非常可怕。 我今年 31 岁，所以也许这只是十年代表我生命三分之一的事实，或者也许是我默默地理解十年前我经常做一些令人尴尬的不成熟的事情。 不管是什么原因，我都很难思考十年的时间范围。

What's more, I think its completely unnecessary!

更何况，我觉得完全没有必要！

You don't need ten years to accomplish something spectacular. You don't need five years. You don't even need three years.

你不需要十年来完成一些壮观的事情。 你不需要五年。 你甚至不需要三年。

The truth: The massive, positive change you're hoping to make in your life is always just one year away.

真相：你希望在生活中做出的巨大、积极的改变总是只需要一年的时间。

I don't say this in a cliche, self help, "you can do anything you set your mind to!" manner. I say it in the literal, tactical, "here's _exactly_ how to lock in and make the change!" manner that I hope you've all come to expect from me and my writing.

我说这话并不是陈词滥调，自助，“你可以做任何你想做的事！” 方式。 我用字面的、战术的方式说，“这就是 _如何_ 锁定并做出改变！” 我希望你们都对我和我的作品有所期待。

So with that as context, let's talk about how to change your life in just one year...

因此，以此为背景，让我们谈谈如何在短短一年内改变你的生活……

## A Brief Personal Story

## 一个简短的个人故事

I started thinking about the power of one year for a very specific reason.

出于一个非常具体的原因，我开始思考一年的力量。

On September 10, 2021, my wife surprised me with the news that she was pregnant.

2021 年 9 月 10 日，我妻子怀孕的消息让我大吃一惊。

Like many people out there, most of whom suffer in silence, we had been uncertain as to whether we would be able to conceive naturally. As you can see in the video, the surprise and joy of the moment poured out of me uncontrollably.

像外面的许多人一样，他们中的大多数人都默默承受着痛苦，我们一直不确定自己是否能够自然受孕。 正如您在视频中看到的那样，那一刻的惊喜和喜悦无法控制地从我身上倾泻而出。

Fast forward one year, and my world looks very different...

快进一年，我的世界看起来非常不同......

September 10, 2021 vs. September 10, 2022

I took a long walk on the one year anniversary and reflected on my emotions and learnings from the year that was.

我在一周年纪念日走了很长一段路，反思了那一年的情绪和学习。

What I kept coming back to: The idea of _something from nothing_.

我一直在回想： _从无到有_ 的想法。

An entire life was created from nothing in the span of a single year. What started as a nothing—a few cells and a line on a testing device—has become a babbling, head-wobbling something.

整个生命是在一年的时间里从无到有创造出来的。 一开始什么都没有——测试设备上的几个细胞和一条线——现在变成了喋喋不休、令人头晕目眩的东西。

It made me think: If an entire life can be created in a single year, what other massive changes are we all capable of making in that same, seemingly short time horizon?

这让我思考：如果一年内可以创造一个完整的生命，那么在同样看似短暂的时间范围内，我们还能做出哪些其他巨大的改变？

## A Year of Possibilities

## 充满可能性的一年

Kaizen is a Japanese word meaning improvement. In practice, the term is used to convey continuous improvement.

Kaizen 是一个日语单词，意思是改进。 在实践中，该术语用于表达持续改进。

The concept of Kaizen began to build a mainstream following with the works of Masaaki Imai, a Japanese organizational theorist and consultant.

随着日本组织理论家和顾问 Masaaki Imai 的著作，Kaizen 的概念开始成为主流。

In 1986, he published a best-seller, entitled "Kaizen: The Key to Japan’s Competitive Success” and founded The Kaizen Institute.

1986 年，他出版了畅销书《改善：日本竞争成功的关键》，并创立了改善研究所。

Kaizen prioritizes a focus on small, daily improvements, rather than large, step-function leaps. It teaches that progress and growth are the result of daily actions to drive the small improvements.

Kaizen 优先关注小的、日常的改进，而不是大的、阶梯式的功能飞跃。 它教导说，进步和成长是日常行动推动小改进的结果。

James Clear has a brilliant visualization of the impact of continuous improvement:

James Clear 对持续改进的影响进行了精彩的可视化：

There are a two key takeaways from this image:

这张图片有两个关键要点：

1.  Compounding is Magic: 1% daily improvements for an entire year will result in a ~38x improvement by the end of the period. This is one of those "a-ha!" moments on the power of compounding. My other favorite is that if you invest $1,000 and generate a 15% annual return, you'll have $1,000,000 after 50 years.
2.  Compounding is a Double-Edged Sword: Compounding cuts both ways. If you get 1% worse each day, you're going to be in a lot of trouble after one year.

1.  复利是魔法：全年每天进步 1% 到该期间结束时将带来约 38 倍的进步。 这是其中一个“啊哈！” 关于复利的力量的时刻。 我另一个最喜欢的是，如果你投资 1,000 美元并产生 15% 的年回报率，那么 50 年后你将拥有 1,000,000 美元。
2.  复利是一把双刃剑：复利是双向的。 如果你每天变得更糟 1%，那么一年后你将遇到很多麻烦。

The conclusion is that dramatic change is possible in one year through making consistent, tiny daily improvements.

结论是，通过持续、微小的日常改进，一年之内就有可能发生巨大的变化。

Ok, but how do we get started on a path of continuous improvement?

好的，但是我们如何开始持续改进的道路呢？

## How to Make Continuous Improvements

## 如何进行持续改进

My framework for continuous improvement is four steps:

我的持续改进框架是四个步骤：

### Step 1: Establish the Desire

### 第一步：确立愿望

The first step towards continuous improvement is establishing a desire to make the improvement.

持续改进的第一步是建立改进的愿望。

I deeply believe that 90% of becoming great at something is just really wanting to be great at it. When you have the desire to make progress at something, you'll find the energy and motivation to make it happen.

我深信，90% 的人在某件事上变得出色只是真的想在这方面做得很好。 当你渴望在某件事上取得进步时，你就会找到实现它的能量和动力。

When you're getting started, write down exactly what you want to do. Be specific about your desires. Put this in a place where you can see it—it helps with vision.

当你开始的时候，准确地写下你想做什么。 具体说明你的愿望。 把它放在你能看到的地方——它有助于视力。

### Step 2: Plan

### 第 2 步：计划

With your desire established in Step 1, create your plan in Step 2.

根据您在第 1 步中确立的愿望，在第 2 步中制定您的计划。

My core belief is that consistent, continuous improvement requires consistent, continuous action. For me, this means that if I want to improve at something, I will do that something every single day.

我的核心信念是，一致、持续的改进需要一致、持续的行动。 对我来说，这意味着如果我想在某件事上有所改进，我会每天都做那件事。

It sounds so simple, but it just plain works:

这听起来很简单，但它只是简单的工作：

-   If you want to improve your cardiovascular health, do some form of cardio training, every single day.
-   如果您想改善心血管健康，请每天进行某种形式的有氧运动训练。
-   If you want to improve your writing, write, every single day.
-   如果你想提高你的写作水平，那就每天写吧。
-   If you want to improve your thinking, read, every single day.
-   如果你想改善你的思维，每天阅读。
-   If you want to improve your relationships, spend time being present with those people, every single day.
-   如果您想改善人际关系，请每天花时间与这些人在一起。

Your plan should be brutally, painfully simple.

你的计划应该是残酷的，痛苦的简单。

What are the 2-3 daily actions that you would need to take to create tangible, compounding progress in your area of choice? These should be the SIMPLEST daily actions.

您需要采取哪些 2-3 项日常行动才能在您选择的领域取得切实的复合进展？ 这些应该是最简单的日常行动。

### Step 3: Execute

### 第 3 步：执行

There are two paths to choose from to execute:

有两种路径可供选择执行：

1.  30-for-30: My [30-for-30 approach](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-30-for-30-challenge) is very simple: Do the daily action for 30 minutes per day for 30 straight days. 30 days is meaningful enough as a commitment that you can't be half-in, but 30 minutes is short enough that you can convince yourself to take it on. 900 minutes of effort in a single month is enough to create tangible progress that will keep you pushing forward. This is my favored approach for getting started on any new area of progress.
2.  Deep Work: Deep work means carving out 1-2 blocks of time per day when you will enter a deeply focused state to make progress against your area of choice. These blocks are generally 1-2 hours for most people and should be completed without distraction. This is the favored strategy for big professional goals, which often require more time and focused energy, but it can feel intimidating given the requirements. Note: Cal Newport's book on this is [great](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692).

1.  30-for-30：我的 [30-for-30 方法](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-30-for-30-challenge) 非常简单：连续 30 天每天做 30 分钟的日常动作。 30 天的承诺足够有意义，你不能半途而废，但 30 分钟足够短，你可以说服自己接受它。 一个月内付出 900 分钟的努力就足以创造切实的进步，让你不断前进。 这是我最喜欢的开始任何新进展领域的方法。
2.  深度工作：深度工作意味着每天抽出 1-2 块时间，届时您将进入高度专注的状态，以在您选择的领域取得进展。 对于大多数人来说，这些模块通常需要 1-2 小时，并且应该在没有分心的情况下完成。 这是大职业目标的首选策略，通常需要更多的时间和精力，但考虑到这些要求，它可能会令人生畏。 注意：Cal Newport 关于这方面的书 [很棒](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) 。

My recommendation: Start with 30-for-30 and then transition to Deep Work after a few months if you feel motivated and energized to go harder.

我的建议：从 30 次 30 次开始，然后如果你感到有动力和精力去更努力地工作，几个月后过渡到深度工作。

### Step 4: Track & Adjust

### 第 4 步：跟踪和调整

Your execution has to be trackable and adjustable.

您的执行必须是可跟踪和可调整的。

Jerry Seinfeld would famously hang a huge calendar on his office wall and use a red marker to put an X over every day that he completed an hour of writing. It wasn't about the writing being good, it was simply about the daily action.

著名的杰里·宋飞 (Jerry Seinfeld) 会在他办公室的墙上挂一个巨大的日历，并在他每天完成一个小时的写作后，用红色记号笔在上面画一个 X。 这不是关于写作好，这只是关于日常行动。

Leverage community to hold you accountable on your journey. There’s nothing more powerful than community when it comes to goal setting and achievement. Create a Google Sheet and track your process goals with others. Forced accountability is a powerful weapon in your arsenal!

利用社区让您对自己的旅程负责。 在目标设定和成就方面，没有什么比社区更强大的了。 创建 Google 表格并与他人一起跟踪您的流程目标。 强制问责制是您武器库中的强大武器！

Avoid becoming dogmatic—allow yourself to adjust as needed along the way. A few common adjustments that you may find useful:

避免变得教条主义——允许自己在过程中根据需要进行调整。 您可能会发现一些有用的常见调整：

-   Downward Adjustments: Overly-ambitious daily process goals should be adjusted down. Set them to be overly-achievable. The human psyche responds well to wins—manufacture them early and benefit later.
-   向下调整：过于雄心勃勃的日常流程目标应该向下调整。 将它们设置为过度可实现的。 人的心理对胜利反应良好——早点制造胜利，晚些时候受益。
-   Environmental Adjustments: Environments that are unsuited to achieving daily process goals should be adjusted. If my daily process goal is to eat a balanced, nutrient-dense breakfast, a kitchen full of junk is an environment unsuited to my goal. Deliberately adjust your environments to match your goals.
-   环境调整：应调整不适合实现日常流程目标的环境。 如果我的日常目标是吃一顿均衡、营养丰富的早餐，那么充满垃圾的厨房是不适合我目标的环境。 有意识地调整您的环境以符合您的目标。

The goals we track and adjust are the goals we achieve.

我们跟踪和调整的目标就是我们实现的目标。

## How to Stay the Course

## 如何坚持到底

One observation I've had on my own journey: It's often very difficult to see and feel progress in the moment.

我在自己的旅程中有一个观察：通常很难看到和感受到当下的进步。

This is the leading cause of lost motivation, habit reversion, and stalled progress.

这是失去动力、倒退习惯和停滞不前的主要原因。

When we fail to see and feel our progress, we lose hope. We start to experience the negative internal feedback loop. It usually sounds something like this:

当我们看不到和感觉不到我们的进步时，我们就会失去希望。 我们开始体验负面的内部反馈循环。 它通常听起来像这样：

"I'm not making any progress. Why am I not making any progress? Probably because I'm not smart or talented, so I was never going to make progress. Why am I doing all of these things every single day if I'm never going to make progress? This is stupid. I'm going to stop."

“我没有取得任何进步。为什么我没有取得任何进步？可能是因为我不聪明或没有天赋，所以我永远不会取得进步。如果我‘我永远不会取得进步吗？这太愚蠢了。我要停下来了。”

The problem is that this is all about perception vs. reality. If you are taking the right daily actions (and refining them as needed), you are making progress (reality), it's just hard to see it sometimes (perception).

问题在于，这完全是关于感知与现实的。 如果你每天采取正确的行动（并根据需要改进它们），你就会取得进步（现实），只是有时很难看到（感知）。

Three ways to fight back and stay the course:

反击并坚持到底的三种方法：

### Zoom Out

### 缩小

Remember this mantra: When in doubt, zoom out.

记住这个口头禅：有疑问时，缩小。

Life is a first person game. You live zoomed in. The issue with this is that the zoomed in view fails to provide perspective on where you started, where you are, and where you're heading.

人生是一场第一人称的游戏。 您实时放大。问题是放大的视图无法提供关于您开始的位置、您所在的位置以及您前进的方向的视角。

When we lose sight of the delta between where we started and where we are, we fail to appreciate the progress and growth our actions have created.

当我们看不到起点和现状之间的差距时，我们就无法欣赏我们的行动所带来的进步和成长。

Zooming out is your first line of defense for staying the course.

缩小是你坚持到底的第一道防线。

_Action Item: Set a weekly reminder to look back at your starting level and compare it to your current level. Doing this weekly will keep you on track._

_行动项目：设置每周提醒以回顾您的起始水平并将其与当前水平进行比较。 每周这样做会让你走上正轨。_

### Micro Rewards

### 微奖励

Give yourself micro rewards for completing the process.

给自己完成这个过程的微奖励。

We often fail to incentivize process, instead focusing all incentives on actual goal achivement. This is the wrong way to go about it.

我们常常无法激励过程，而是将所有激励措施都集中在实际目标的实现上。 这是错误的做法。

Start incentivizing your completion of the daily actions that will contribute to the long-term achievement.

开始激励您完成有助于长期成就的日常行动。

_Action Item: Establish a weekly micro reward (one that doesn't set you back from your core goals). Write it up on your screen or whiteboard so that you know what you can look forward to if you stick to your plan._

_行动项目：建立每周微量奖励（不会让您偏离核心目标的奖励）。 把它写在你的屏幕或白板上，这样你就知道如果你坚持你的计划你会期待什么。_

### Look Back & Cringe

### 回顾与畏缩

My favorite strategy for staying the course: Review some of your old work and cringe at how bad it is!

我最喜欢坚持到底的策略：回顾你以前的一些作品，并对它有多糟糕感到畏缩！

As discussed around the zoom out strategy, it's easy to lose sight of the progress you're making when you're living in the moment. Reviewing old work in detail is a good way to force the progress to the top of your mind.

正如围绕缩小策略所讨论的那样，当你活在当下时，很容易忽视你正在取得的进步。 详细回顾以前的工作是将进展放在首位的好方法。

If you're trying to become a world class writer, go look at some of your writing from 6 months ago. Assuming you've been writing every day since then, you can safely assume that the old writing will make you cringe at how bad it seems.

如果你想成为世界级的作家，请看看你 6 个月前的一些作品。 假设从那以后你每天都在写作，你可以放心地假设旧的写作会让你对它看起来有多糟糕感到畏缩。

That's growth!

那就是成长！

_Action Item: Establish a monthly cadence to review your old work. Embrace the cringe._

_行动项目：建立每月一次的节奏来回顾你以前的工作。 拥抱畏缩。_
