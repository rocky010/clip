John’s life changed forever when he broke up with his girlfriend. The breakup sent him into a downward spiral, and led to his first depressive episode when he was 27 years old. “At first it’s just extreme sadness … then you start losing sleep,” says John (not his real name), who spoke on condition of anonymity. He developed crippling anxiety and experienced panic attacks and dark thoughts that eventually led him to attempt to end his own life.

约翰与女友分手后，他的生活永远改变了。 分手让他陷入了恶性循环，并导致他在 27 岁时第一次抑郁发作。 “起初只是极度悲伤……然后你开始失眠，”不愿透露姓名的约翰（化名）说。 他患上了严重的焦虑症，并经历了惊恐发作和阴暗的想法，最终导致他试图结束自己的生命。

Drugs didn’t work for John—he says he has tried pretty much every antidepressant, antipsychotic, and sedative out there. And while electroconvulsive therapy—a treatment that delivers electrical stimulation to one or both sides of a person’s head—eventually pulled him out of his first depressive episode, it didn’t touch the symptoms of his second episode, which started around five years later.

药物对约翰不起作用——他说他已经尝试了几乎所有的抗抑郁药、抗精神病药和镇静剂。 虽然电休克疗法——一种对人头部的一侧或两侧进行电刺激的治疗——最终使他摆脱了第一次抑郁发作，但并没有触及大约五年后开始的第二次发作的症状。

But as part of a clinical trial, John has benefited from an experimental treatment that involves inserting electrodes deep into his brain to deliver regular pulses of electricity. Deep brain stimulation is already used to treat severe cases of epilepsy and a few movement disorders such as Parkinson’s. But depression is more complicated—partly because we still don’t fully understand what’s going on in the brain when it occurs.

但作为临床试验的一部分，约翰受益于一项实验性治疗，该治疗涉及将电极深入他的大脑，以提供有规律的电脉冲。 深部脑刺激已被用于治疗严重的癫痫症和一些运动障碍，如帕金森症。 但抑郁症要复杂得多——部分原因是我们仍然不完全了解它发生时大脑中发生了什么。

“Depression is a complex illness,” says Patricio Riva Posse, a neurologist at the Emory School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia, who was not involved in the trial. “It’s not like trying to correct one tremor—there’s a whole universe of symptoms.” These include low mood, suicidality, inability to experience pleasure, and changes in motivation, sleep, and appetite.

“抑郁症是一种复杂的疾病，”佐治亚州亚特兰大埃默里医学院的神经学家 Patricio Riva Posse 说，他没有参与试验。 “这不像是试图纠正一次颤抖——有一大堆症状。” 这些包括情绪低落、自杀倾向、无法体验快乐以及动机、睡眠和食欲的变化。

Doctors have been using electricity to treat brain disorders—including depression—for decades, and some studies have found that electrodes placed deep inside the brain can jolt some people out of their symptoms. But results vary. Neuroscientists hope that by getting a better idea of what’s happening inside the brains of people with symptoms like John’s, they can make the treatment more effective.

几十年来，医生一直在使用电来治疗大脑疾病——包括抑郁症——一些研究发现，放置在大脑深处的电极可以使一些人摆脱症状。 但结果各不相同。 神经科学家希望通过更好地了解出现约翰症状的人的大脑内部发生的事情，他们可以使治疗更有效。

John is one of five people who have volunteered to have their brains probed as part of a clinical trial. At the start of 2020, he had a total of 14 electrodes implanted across his brain. For nine days, he stayed in a hospital with protruding cables wrapped around his head, while neuroscientists monitored how his brain activity correlated with his mood.

约翰是自愿接受大脑探测作为临床试验一部分的五个人之一。 2020 年初，他的大脑总共植入了 14 个电极。 他在医院住了九天，头上缠着突出的电缆，而神经科学家则监测他的大脑活动与情绪的关系。

The researchers behind the trial say they have developed a “mood decoder”—a way of being able to work out how someone is feeling just by looking at brain activity. Using the decoder, the scientists hope to be able to measure how severe a person’s depression is, and target more precisely where the electrodes are placed to optimize the effect on the patient’s mood. So far, they have analyzed the results of three volunteers.

该试验背后的研究人员表示，他们已经开发出一种“情绪解码器”——一种仅通过观察大脑活动就能了解某人感受的方法。 使用解码器，科学家们希望能够测量一个人的抑郁症有多严重，并更精确地定位电极放置的位置，以优化对患者情绪的影响。 到目前为止，他们已经分析了三名志愿者的结果。

What they have found is extremely promising, says Sameer Sheth, a neurosurgeon based at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, who is leading the trial. Not only have he and his colleagues been able to link volunteers’ specific brain activity with their mood, but they have also found a way to stimulate a positive mood. “This is the first demonstration of successful and consistent mood decoding of humans in these brain regions,” says Sheth. His colleague Jiayang Xiao [presented the findings](https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/10619/presentation/81875) at the Society for Neuroscience’s annual meeting in San Diego in November.

德克萨斯州休斯敦贝勒医学院的神经外科医生 Sameer Sheth 说，他们的发现非常有希望，他是这项试验的负责人。 他和他的同事们不仅能够将志愿者的特定大脑活动与他们的情绪联系起来，而且他们还找到了一种激发积极情绪的方法。 “这是人类在这些大脑区域成功且一致的情绪解码的首次证明，”Sheth 说。 他的同事 Jiayang Xiao [介绍了这些发现。](https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/10619/presentation/81875) 于 11 月在圣地亚哥举行的神经科学学会年会上

### Zapping depression

### 抑郁症

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) usually involves placing one or two electrodes deep into the brain to deliver pulses of electricity to specific regions. It can work really well for some people with Parkinson’s disease, where it’s used to stimulate areas that control movement. Researchers are exploring whether it might also help treat psychiatric issues including obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and depression.

深部脑刺激 (DBS) 通常涉及将一个或两个电极深入大脑，以将电脉冲传送到特定区域。 它对一些患有帕金森病的人非常有效，它被用来刺激控制运动的区域。 研究人员正在探索它是否也有助于治疗精神疾病，包括强迫症、饮食失调和抑郁症。

A handful of studies performed in the early and mid 2000s suggested that [DBS could help people with depression](https://www.technologyreview.com/2007/04/26/225871/brain-electrodes-help-treat-depression/) that didn’t respond to typical treatments, like antidepressants. But initial results of two large clinical trials were disappointing, and the tests were stopped early.

在 2000 年代初期和中期进行的一些研究表明， [DBS 可以帮助那些](https://www.technologyreview.com/2007/04/26/225871/brain-electrodes-help-treat-depression/) 对典型治疗（如抗抑郁药）没有反应的抑郁症患者。 但两项大型临床试验的初步结果令人失望，试验提前停止。

It’s not clear why these trials didn’t see the same results as earlier studies. But the varying success rates might have something to do with how the brain stimulation is delivered. Several brain regions are thought to play a role in depression. And there are lots of potential ways to deliver electrical pulses. “We don’t know how to deliver DBS intelligently to any given individual \[with depression\],” says Sheth. “This is just a very immature therapy.”

目前尚不清楚为什么这些试验没有看到与早期研究相同的结果。 但不同的成功率可能与大脑刺激的传递方式有关。 几个大脑区域被认为在抑郁症中起作用。 并且有很多潜在的方法可以传递电脉冲。 “我们不知道如何智能地将 DBS 提供给任何给定的 \[抑郁症\] 个体，”Sheth 说。 “这只是一种非常不成熟的疗法。”

Sheth has been trying to figure out what might work best. He and his colleagues have borrowed a brain surgery approach that is sometimes used to help people with epilepsy who don’t get better with drugs.

Sheth 一直在努力找出最有效的方法。 他和他的同事们借用了一种脑部手术方法，这种方法有时被用来帮助药物治疗无效的癫痫患者。

In these cases, doctors might implant electrodes across the person’s brain in order to find out where the seizures are starting. Once identified, these regions can either be stimulated with electrodes or removed entirely.

在这些情况下，医生可能会在患者的大脑中植入电极，以查明癫痫发作的起点。 一旦确定，这些区域可以用电极刺激或完全移除。

Depression doesn’t originate from a single point in the brain, the way a seizure does. But Sheth and his colleagues are taking the same approach—temporarily implanting electrodes across the brain to monitor brain activity—for insight into the condition.

抑郁症不像癫痫发作那样起源于大脑中的一个点。 但 Sheth 和他的同事正在采用相同的方法——临时在大脑中植入电极以监测大脑活动——以深入了解这种情况。

The team is particularly interested in how patterns of brain activity differ when a person is feeling better or especially low. Sheth and his colleagues are also experimenting with stimulation—what level, type, and frequency works best to get the brain back to a positive mood state? Armed with this information, neurosurgeons will be in a much better position to help people with depression, and deep brain stimulation is more likely to work, says Sheth.

该团队特别感兴趣的是，当一个人感觉好些或特别低落时，大脑活动模式有何不同。 Sheth 和他的同事们也在试验刺激——什么水平、类型和频率最能使大脑恢复到积极的情绪状态？ Sheth 说，有了这些信息，神经外科医生就能更好地帮助抑郁症患者，深部脑刺激也更有可能奏效。

### Back online

### 重新上线

John was the first trial volunteer to undergo the procedure. Sheth and his colleagues put him under general anesthetic before drilling holes into his skull to insert the electrodes. The team implanted two DBS electrodes on each side of the brain in regions thought to be involved in symptoms of depression. An additional five temporary electrodes were placed on each side of the brain to monitor John’s activity in regions linked to mood and cognition.

约翰是第一个接受手术的试验志愿者。 Sheth 和他的同事先对他进行了全身麻醉，然后在他的头骨上钻孔以插入电极。 该团队在大脑两侧被认为与抑郁症状有关的区域植入了两个 DBS 电极。 另外五个临时电极被放置在大脑的每一侧，以监测约翰在与情绪和认知相关的区域的活动。

To find the right place to stimulate, the team needed to wake John up during his operation. He remembers being repeatedly asked how he felt as surgeons probed his brain with electrodes. “Then they hit a spot and I said: ‘I actually feel back online,’” he says. “Depression is like a constant weight on your soul. When they touched that perfect little spot, that weight lifted.”

为了找到合适的刺激位置，团队需要在手术过程中叫醒约翰。 他记得当外科医生用电极探查他的大脑时，有人反复问他感觉如何。 “然后他们说到点子上了，我说：'我真的感觉回到了网上，'”他说。 “抑郁症就像是你灵魂上的一个沉重负担。 当他们触摸到那个完美的小点时，那个重量就减轻了。”

He remembers hearing the doctors laugh and tell him they’d found the right place, and then falling back asleep.

他记得听到医生笑着告诉他他们找到了正确的地方，然后又睡着了。

John woke up “with a headache like nothing ever before” and spent the next nine days being closely monitored by Sheth and his colleagues. Every few hours, the medical team would ask him questions about his mood and how he was feeling.

约翰醒来时“感到前所未有的头痛”，在接下来的九天里，谢思和他的同事们一直在密切监视着他。 每隔几个小时，医疗团队就会询问他的情绪和感受。

At the end of the nine days, the team removed the 10 monitoring electrodes from John’s brain but left in the four DBS electrodes. These electrodes were connected to a rechargeable battery implanted in John’s chest. In the years since, the pulses of stimulation have been tweaked slightly. Six months after the operation, the team turned off the stimulation without telling John. His symptoms immediately worsened. “It was obvious,” he says. “I told them: ‘I don’t know what you did, but I can’t sleep, I’m anxious … it’s not working.”

九天结束时，研究小组从约翰的大脑中取出了 10 个监测电极，但保留了四个 DBS 电极。 这些电极与植入约翰胸部的可充电电池相连。 从那以后的几年里，刺激的脉冲已经略有调整。 手术六个月后，团队在没有告诉约翰的情况下关闭了刺激。 他的症状立即恶化。 “这很明显，”他说。 “我告诉他们：‘我不知道你们做了什么，但我睡不着，我很焦虑……这不管用。”

The device was switched back on and has been running ever since. Sheth’s team has carried out the same procedure in four other people so far—all of them with severe, treatment-resistant depression. They plan to study 12 people in total.

该设备已重新打开并一直运行至今。 到目前为止，Sheth 的团队已经对另外四个人进行了相同的手术——他们都患有严重的、难以治疗的抑郁症。 他们计划总共研究 12 个人。

Despite the early signs of success, Sheth and his colleagues don’t plan to carry out this same procedure more widely. Temporarily implanting 10 electrodes into the brain provides insight into a specific person’s depression, but it isn’t a practical approach for a condition that [affects almost 3 million people in the US alone](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33989464/). It is an invasive, expensive procedure that takes a lot of time and carries risks.

尽管有成功的早期迹象，Sheth 和他的同事们并不打算更广泛地开展同样的手术。 将 10 个电极暂时植入大脑可以深入了解特定人的抑郁症，但对于 [仅在美国就影响近 300 万人](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33989464/) 的疾病来说，这并不是一种实用的方法。 这是一种侵入性的、昂贵的程序，需要花费大量时间并带来风险。

Instead, Sheth hopes to find trends among his 12 volunteers and use these to develop an improved form of DBS that can help anyone who needs it. “We’re hoping that there are some generalizable findings that we get out of this,” he says.

相反，Sheth 希望在他的 12 名志愿者中找到趋势，并利用这些趋势开发一种改进的 DBS 形式，以帮助任何需要它的人。 “我们希望我们能从中得到一些普遍的发现，”他说。

Sheth and his colleagues have analyzed brain recordings from only three people so far, but they are already seeing trends. A brain region called the cingulate cortex fires in a certain way when all three are in a better mood and shows the opposite pattern of activity when the volunteers are experiencing a low mood, says Sheth.

到目前为止，Sheth 和他的同事只分析了三个人的大脑记录，但他们已经看到了趋势。 Sheth 说，当这三个人的心情都很好时，一个叫做扣带皮层的大脑区域会以某种方式激活，而当志愿者情绪低落时，它会表现出相反的活动模式。

Riva Posse says that the results are “very encouraging.” We are starting to understand that “there are signals of depression that seem to be pretty consistent across the board,” he says. “This is going to advance, considerably, the understanding of depression and help come up with … neurostimulation approaches.”

Riva Posse 说结果“非常令人鼓舞”。 他说，我们开始明白“抑郁症的信号似乎在所有方面都非常一致”。 “这将大大推进对抑郁症的理解，并帮助提出……神经刺激方法。”

Still, it is still too soon to say whether these findings will track across a larger group of people. “It’s only three patients,” says Darin Dougherty, a psychiatrist at Mass General Research Institute in Boston who specializes in neurosurgery for depression. 

尽管如此，现在说这些发现是否会追踪更大的人群还为时过早。 “只有三个病人，”波士顿麻省综合研究所的精神病学家达林多尔蒂说，他专门研究抑郁症的神经外科手术。

Dougherty thinks that Sheth’s research is “essential.” He adds, “Hopefully they can get enough data from a small group of people so that we can move away from \[implanting multiple temporary electrodes\].” He predicts that Sheth’s approach might identify a brain region that will be worth targeting in most people with treatment-resistant depression, and that noninvasive brain scans will find the exact spot to implant the electrode.

Dougherty 认为 Sheth 的研究是“必不可少的”。 他补充说，“希望他们能从一小群人那里获得足够的数据，这样我们就可以摆脱\[植入多个临时电极\]。” 他预测，Sheth 的方法可能会确定一个大脑区域，该区域对于大多数难治性抑郁症患者来说都是值得瞄准的，并且非侵入性脑部扫描将找到植入电极的确切位置。

### Measuring mood

### 测量情绪

Sheth and his colleagues also found some differences among the three volunteers, and the team’s “mood decoder” could identify how each volunteer was feeling based on their brain activity.

Sheth 和他的同事们还发现了三名志愿者之间的一些差异，该团队的“情绪解码器”可以根据每个志愿者的大脑活动来识别他们的感受。

He hopes that in the future, new technologies will allow him and others to collect this information noninvasively, perhaps using a device that sits on a person’s head. Such a device could be used to measure the severity of a person’s symptoms, he says.

他希望在未来，新技术将使他和其他人能够无创地收集这些信息，或许可以使用坐在人头上的设备。 他说，这样的设备可以用来衡量一个人症状的严重程度。

Today, a person with symptoms of depression will typically be asked a series of questions to determine the severity of the condition. Having some kind of objective measure—such as readings from a brain scan—is a key goal for psychiatry, says Dougherty.

今天，一个有抑郁症状的人通常会被问到一系列问题，以确定病情的严重程度。 多尔蒂说，拥有某种客观的衡量标准——比如脑部扫描的读数——是精神病学的一个关键目标。

It could also be problematic, though. Brain scans might never be sensitive enough to account for individual differences in people’s brains when it comes to symptoms of depression, and they might miss signs in some people and overestimate them in others. Sheth also acknowledges the possibility that because of research like his, brain scans could one day be used to diagnose depression in someone who is not obviously unwell or reveal it in someone who doesn’t want it known. 

不过，这也可能有问题。 当涉及到抑郁症状时，脑部扫描可能永远不够灵敏，无法解释人们大脑中的个体差异，而且它们可能会漏掉某些人的症状，而高估其他人的症状。 Sheth 也承认，由于像他这样的研究，有朝一日脑部扫描可能会被用来诊断没有明显不适的人的抑郁症，或者在不想让别人知道的人身上发现抑郁症。

John, for one, doesn’t want others—particularly potential employers—to know he has a history of depression. “People don’t understand depression, and unfortunately, they see it as a weakness,” he says.

约翰，例如，不想让其他人——尤其是潜在的雇主——知道他有抑郁症史。 “人们不了解抑郁症，不幸的是，他们将其视为一种弱点，”他说。

“You can’t really argue that… we should not try to help all these millions and millions of people with depression… just because there’s a possibility of misuse,” says Sheth. “We have to find ways of helping these folks. The rest of society can help us put guardrails on how this technology should be used.”

“你真的不能争辩说......我们不应该试图帮助所有这些数以百万计的抑郁症患者......仅仅因为存在滥用的可能性，”Sheth 说。 “我们必须找到帮助这些人的方法。 社会上的其他人可以帮助我们为如何使用这项技术设置护栏。”

John’s electrodes are still delivering pulses of electrical stimulation deep in his brain. He charges the battery embedded in his chest every week. “As far as I know, if the stimulation stops, I go back to square one,” he says. And while DBS might not work for everyone for depression, “it saved my life,” he says.

约翰的电极仍在他大脑深处传送电刺激脉冲。 他每周都会为嵌入胸腔的电池充电。 “据我所知，如果刺激停止，我会回到原点，”他说。 虽然 DBS 可能不适用于每个人的抑郁症，但“它救了我的命，”他说。
