"Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated." - Confucius

“生活真的很简单，但我们坚持要把它复杂化。” ——孔子

The spirit of this quote rings true: We humans have a tendency to manufacture complexity.

这句话的精神听起来是正确的：我们人类有制造复杂性的倾向。

We make progress in our lives—personally or professionally—and decide that the best way to celebrate that progress is to sprinkle on a new bit of chaos.

我们在生活中取得了进步——无论是个人还是职业——并决定庆祝这一进步的最佳方式是洒上一点新的混乱。

It's a rather frustrating (and hilarious) species-wide trait:

这是一个相当令人沮丧（和热闹）的物种范围的特征：

-   We book the relaxing vacation, only to fill every moment of it with activities that leave us more drained at the end than we were at the beginning.
-   我们预订了轻松的假期，只是为了让假期的每一刻都充满活动，这些活动让我们在结束时比开始时更加疲惫。
-   We get the promotion that will reduce our money stress, so we celebrate by buying the boat that is constantly in need of servicing and repairs.
-   我们获得了可以减轻金钱压力的促销活动，因此我们通过购买经常需要维修和修理的船来庆祝。
-   We feel busy and stressed, so we cut something out of our lives, only to feel stressed about not feeling busy, so we add something back in.
-   我们感到忙碌和压力，所以我们从生活中剪掉一些东西，只是因为不觉得忙碌而感到压力，所以我们又重新加入了一些东西。

We can all come together and laugh at our "complexification" of life. But after we have that good, hearty laugh, let's talk about ways to simplify it.

我们都可以聚在一起，嘲笑我们生活的“复杂化”。 但在我们开怀大笑之后，让我们谈谈简化它的方法。

Here are 50+ short, timeless insights for simplifying your world—"hacks" for your life, careers, relationships, health, money, and more...

这里有 50 多条简短、永恒的见解，可简化您的世界——针对您的生活、职业、人际关系、健康、金钱等的“黑客”……

## Life Hacks

## 生活技巧

Make a rule to never think twice about investments in yourself. Books, quality food, fitness, and personal development all fit into this bucket. These investments pay dividends for a long time. Think about material purchases instead—wait 48 hours to complete an order to see if you still want it.

制定规则，永远不要对自己的投资三思而后行。 书籍、优质食品、健身和个人发展都适合这个桶。 这些投资会带来长期的红利。 考虑购买材料——等待 48 小时完成订单，看看您是否仍然需要它。

If you want to get better at anything, do it for [30 minutes per day for 30 straight days](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-30-for-30-challenge). It's easy to over-engineer progress—a bit of dedicated effort each day is all you need. 900 minutes of accumulated effort is enough to make dramatic improvements at literally anything.

如果您想在任何方面做得更好，请连续 [30 天每天坚持 30 分钟](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-30-for-30-challenge) 。 过度设计进步很容易——每天付出一点点努力就是你所需要的。 900 分钟的累积努力足以在任何事情上取得显着进步。

Learn one funny or good dance move that you can reliably bust out when you inevitably get pushed into the center of a dance circle at a wedding or event.

学习一个有趣或好的舞蹈动作，当你在婚礼或活动中不可避免地被推到舞圈的中心时，你可以可靠地摆脱它。

Reread your favorite books annually. You may read thousands of books in your life, but there will only be a few that deeply change you. Reread them every single year. Your experience with the book will change as you do—you'll pick up new perspectives. It's beautiful.

每年重读你最喜欢的书。 你一生中可能读过成千上万本书，但能深深改变你的只有几本书。 每年重读一次。 你对这本书的体验会随着你的改变而改变——你会获得新的观点。 很美丽。

In your 20s and 30s, do a few things that you'll be excited to tell your kids about someday. Go on an adventure, train for some wild event, get your hands dirty on a crazy project, whatever. Create a few stories worth telling.

在你 20 多岁和 30 多岁的时候，做一些你有一天会很高兴告诉你的孩子的事情。 去冒险，为一些狂野的事件训练，亲手参与一个疯狂的项目，等等。 创造一些值得讲述的故事。

Be bored for at least 15 minutes per day. “All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” - Blaise Pascal. We’ve completely forgotten how to be bored, but it’s a tremendous unlock for creativity and mindfulness.

每天至少感到无聊 15 分钟。 “人类所有的问题都源于人无法独自安静地坐在房间里。” - 布莱斯·帕斯卡。 我们已经完全忘记了如何感到无聊，但它极大地释放了创造力和正念。

Take yourself out for a meal alone once each month. Carry a notebook and pen, bring your favorite book, and leave your phone in your bag. Let your mind run free. Flex that boredom muscle. It’s insanely freeing—a meditative experience.

每个月带自己出去吃一次饭。 带上笔记本和笔，带上你最喜欢的书，把手机放在包里。 让你的思想自由奔跑。 弯曲那无聊的肌肉。 这是一种疯狂的自由——一种冥想的体验。

If you're about to say yes to something on the assumption that you'll have more time for it in the future, say no instead. We tend to believe that we will have more time a month from now than we do today—this leads to accepting commitments that we later regret. Just say no.

如果你打算对某事说“是”，假设你将来会有更多时间做某件事，那就说“不”。 我们倾向于相信，从现在起一个月后，我们将拥有比今天更多的时间——这导致我们接受了后来后悔的承诺。 拒绝吧。

Send a letter to your future self once each year on your birthday. Reflect on the present, changes you want to make, and goals for the future. Use an online tool like FutureMe to have it sent in 1-5 years. You'll benefit from the reflection in the present and the smiles when you open them in the future.

每年生日那天给未来的自己写一封信。 反思现在，你想要做出的改变，以及未来的目标。 使用 FutureMe 等在线工具在 1-5 年内发送。 你会受益于现在的反思和未来打开它们时的微笑。

Have at least one thing in your life that you are bad at (but love doing). Ambitious, driven people tend to do everything with some specific end in mind. It's wonderfully refreshing to do something just for the sake of doing it.

在你的生活中至少有一件你不擅长的事情（但喜欢做）。 雄心勃勃、有上进心的人往往做任何事情都会怀着特定的目的。 仅仅为了做某事而做某事真是令人耳目一新。

Do one hard thing every day when you could do it the easy way. Take the stairs even if the elevator is working, run up the hill even if there is a flat route home, take the cold shower even if the hot water is working. When we do hard things, we train ourselves to embrace friction and build resilience. Hard things compound.

每天做一件困难的事情，当你可以用简单的方法做的时候。 坐电梯也要走楼梯，即使有平坦的回家路也要跑上山坡，即使开着热水也要冲冷水澡。 当我们做艰难的事情时，我们训练自己接受摩擦并建立韧性。 坚硬的东西复合。

As a rule of thumb, don’t consume the news unless you're highly confident it will matter one month from now. Consuming more news has become a reliable way to understand less about the world. Focus on smaller doses of high signal content vs. a constant drip of the "BREAKING NEWS" that has become the standard of the industry.

根据经验，除非您非常有信心一个月后它会很重要，否则不要消费新闻。 消费更多新闻已成为减少对世界了解的可靠方式。 专注于更小剂量的高信号内容，而不是不断滴入已成为行业标准的“突发新闻”。

Write down three things you’re grateful for every single night before you go to bed. Say one of them out loud every single morning when you wake up.

每天晚上睡觉前写下三件让你感激的事情。 每天早上醒来时大声说出其中的一个。

Stop trying to be interesting and focus on being interested. Interested people are prone to giving their deep attention to something to learn more about it. They open up to the world—they ask great questions & observe. Being interested is how you become interesting.

停止尝试变得有趣，专注于感兴趣。 有兴趣的人很容易对某件事给予深刻的关注，以了解更多。 他们向世界敞开心扉——他们提出很好的问题并观察。 有兴趣是你如何变得有趣。

Stop trying to remember things and just write everything down. Use your phone notes app—or better yet, carry a small pocket notebook and pen. The old fashioned way still works wonders.

停止尝试记住事情，把所有事情都写下来。 使用你的电话笔记应用程序——或者更好的是，随身携带一个小笔记本和一支笔。 老式的方式仍然创造奇迹。

When trying to break a bad habit, wear a small rubber band on your wrist and snap it (lightly) on yourself each time you do the thing you're trying to stop. The action creates awareness that starts the breaking process.

当你试图改掉一个坏习惯时，在你的手腕上戴一个小橡皮筋，并在每次你做你想停止的事情时（轻轻地）将它扣在自己身上。 这个动作创造了开始打破过程的意识。

When faced with a difficult decision, ask yourself what your 80-year-old self and 10-year-old self would want you to do. Your 80-year-old self is most concerned with the long-term compounding of the action, while your 10-year-old self will remind you to have some fun.

当面临艰难的决定时，问问自己，80 岁的自己和 10 岁的自己希望自己做什么。 80 岁的自己最关心的是长期复合动作，而 10 岁的自己会提醒自己找点乐子。

## Career Hacks

## 职业黑客

Spend 15 minutes on Sunday evening preparing for what your first focus tasks are going to be on Monday morning. That 15 minutes will save you 2 hours and a whole lot of stress. Don’t over-engineer it. Get one small thing done that makes the next morning look and feel easier.

周日晚上花 15 分钟时间为周一早上的第一个重点任务做准备。 这 15 分钟将为您节省 2 小时，并减轻很多压力。 不要过度设计它。 做一件让第二天早上看起来和感觉起来更轻松的小事。

When you're starting your career, "swallow the frog" for your boss to get ahead. Observe your boss, figure out what they hate doing, learn to do it, and take it off their plate. It's an easy way to add value, put up a win, and build momentum.

当你开始你的职业生涯时，“吞下青蛙”让你的老板获得成功。 观察你的老板，弄清楚他们讨厌做什么，学会去做，然后把它从他们的盘子里拿走。 这是增加价值、赢得胜利和建立动力的简单方法。

Set your emails to have a 60-second delay before sending. You notice most mistakes immediately after hitting send—the delay allows you to catch them. Also, if you're sending an email in the heat of the moment, the delay lets you cool off and reassess if it's worth it before it enters the world.

将您的电子邮件设置为在发送前延迟 60 秒。 您会在点击发送后立即注意到大多数错误——延迟可以让您发现它们。 此外，如果您是在一时冲动的情况下发送电子邮件，那么延迟可以让您冷静下来并在它进入世界之前重新评估它是否值得。

Batch email processing into condensed windows. Depending on your industry, it may be anywhere from 1-3 windows per day. Parkinson's Law says that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. Force a time constraint on low-value tasks to get them done efficiently.

将电子邮件批量处理成压缩窗口。 根据您所在的行业，每天可能有 1-3 个窗口。 帕金森定律说工作会扩展以填满完成它的可用时间。 对低价值任务施加时间限制，以高效完成它们。

When you're trying to learn something new, attempt to teach it to a friend or family member. See what questions they ask and how those questions expose the gaps in your knowledge. Study more to fill in those gaps. The act of teaching is the most powerful form of learning.

当您尝试学习新事物时，请尝试将其教给朋友或家人。 查看他们提出的问题以及这些问题如何暴露您的知识差距。 学习更多以填补这些空白。 教学行为是最强大的学习形式。

Download a free focus app (I like [Flow](https://flowapp.info/)) to execute short sprints of focused work. The app will restrict any apps you want from being opened during your block. If you're prone to checking your phone, put it in another room so that you physically can't see or touch it.

下载一个免费的专注应用程序（我喜欢 [Flow](https://flowapp.info/) ）来执行专注工作的短时间冲刺。 该应用程序将限制您想要的任何应用程序在您的封锁期间被打开。 如果您倾向于查看手机，请将它放在另一个房间，这样您就无法看到或触摸到它。

## Relationship Hacks

## 关系黑客

When you think something nice about someone, let them know. It's a shame that we often wait until a person's funeral to say all of the nice things we thought about them. The next time you have a positive thought about someone—tell them right then.

当您认为某人有什么优点时，请让他们知道。 遗憾的是，我们常常等到一个人的葬礼才说出我们对他们的所有好话。 下次您对某人有积极的想法时，请立即告诉他们。

Tell your partner one thing you appreciate about them every single day. As time passes in any relationship, it becomes easy to take the good for granted. Don't fall into this trap. Highlight the good!

每天告诉你的伴侣一件你欣赏他们的事情。 在任何关系中随着时间的流逝，人们很容易将好的视为理所当然。 不要落入这个陷阱。 突出好！

Invest in personalized stationery and use it regularly. Emails and texts lack personality. Good penmanship and a handwritten note will always stand out. Handwritten notes are an "old fashioned" thing that should definitely make a comeback.

投资个性化文具并定期使用。 电子邮件和短信缺乏个性。 良好的书法和手写的笔记将永远脱颖而出。 手写笔记是一种“过时”的东西，绝对应该卷土重来。

If you’re trying to make conversation with someone that you are intimidated by, ask what they're currently working on that they're most excited about. It's a simple question, but it gets them talking and animated. Ask follow ups and listen intently.

如果你想和你害怕的人交谈，问问他们目前正在做什么，他们最感兴趣的是什么。 这是一个简单的问题，但它让他们说话并充满活力。 询问跟进并专心聆听。

When someone is going through hell, just saying “I’m with you” is the most powerful thing you can do. Advice, perspectives, or offers to help are minimally impactful. The notion that someone is with you is 10x more powerful. Be the “darkest hour friend” to those you love.

当有人经历地狱时，说“我和你在一起”是你能做的最有力的事情。 建议、观点或提供帮助的影响微乎其微。 有人和你在一起的想法要强大 10 倍。 做你爱的人的“至暗时刻的朋友”。

Record a video interview with your parents. Ask them questions and have them tell stories about their childhood, adventures, hopes, dreams, and fears. Our time with them is finite, but we often fail to recognize it until it's too late. These recordings will last forever.

录制与父母的视频采访。 问他们问题，让他们讲述他们的童年、冒险、希望、梦想和恐惧的故事。 我们与他们在一起的时间是有限的，但我们常常直到为时已晚才意识到这一点。 这些录音将永远存在。

If someone tries to put down your accomplishments, cut them out of your life. These people are "boat anchors"—they try to hold you back and create a drag on your progress. Distance yourself from anyone who spends time bringing others down or dismissing their achievements.

如果有人试图贬低你的成就，请将它们从你的生活中剔除。 这些人是“船锚”——他们试图阻止你并拖累你的进步。 远离那些花时间贬低他人或贬低他人成就的人。

If you’re torn on what gift to send someone, send a book. Flowers, bottles of alcohol, and other standard gifts are easy to forget—a great book that has special meaning to you will be remembered.

如果你纠结于送什么礼物给某人，那就送一本书吧。 鲜花、酒瓶和其他标准礼物很容易忘记——一本对你有特殊意义的好书会被记住。

Carry a pocket notebook and pen with you everywhere you go. If you’re with someone and they say something interesting, take it out and write it down. It’s way more polite than taking out your phone, it’ll make sure you remember the thing they said, and it shows you’re actively listening.

随身携带一个袖珍笔记本和一支笔。 如果你和某人在一起，他们说了一些有趣的话，就把它拿出来写下来。 这比拿出你的手机更有礼貌，它会确保你记住他们说的话，而且它表明你正在积极倾听。

When you meet someone, say their name back to them once in conversation. Once is enough to cement it in your mind, and if you do it more than once, it starts to sound phony.

当你遇到某人时，在谈话中说一次他们的名字。 一次就足以将它牢记在心，如果你不止一次这样做，它就会开始听起来很虚伪。

Never keep score in life. When you’re with friends, pick up the check now and then—it all evens out if they're real friends. Quid pro quo is a terrible way to live.

生活中永远不要计分。 当你和朋友在一起时，时不时地去结账——如果他们是真正的朋友，一切都会平息。 交换条件是一种可怕的生活方式。

If someone regularly brags about their wealth, income, or success, just assume the reality is about 50% of what they say.

如果有人经常吹嘘自己的财富、收入或成功，只需假设他们所说的大约 50% 是真实的。

If you’re about to take an emotion-induced action, wait 24 hours. Many relationships have been broken by actions taken in the heat of the moment. Don't fall into the trap.

如果您打算采取情绪诱发的行动，请等待 24 小时。 许多关系因一时冲动而采取的行动而破裂。 不要掉入陷阱。

The first time someone acts negatively toward you, assume they are just having a bad day. The second time someone acts negatively toward you, assume they are a bad person.

第一次有人对你做出负面行为时，假设他们只是今天过得很糟糕。 第二次有人对你做出负面行为时，假设他们是坏人。

Give a stranger a compliment every single day. Say you like their shirt or shoes, compliment their haircut, whatever. Don't use it as a conversation starter—say it and just continue on. Getting a simple compliment from someone can make a person's entire day.

每天赞美一个陌生人。 说你喜欢他们的衬衫或鞋子，称赞他们的发型等等。 不要用它作为对话的开场白——说出来然后继续。 从某人那里得到一个简单的赞美可以使一个人度过一整天。

## Health Hacks

## 健康黑客

If you're struggling to fall asleep, try the 4-7-8 method: Breathe in through your nose for a 4-second count, hold your breath for a 7-second count, and exhale for an 8-second count. It activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which triggers your body to turn to rest mode.

如果您难以入睡，请尝试 4-7-8 方法：用鼻子吸气数 4 秒，屏住呼吸数 7 秒，然后呼气数 8 秒。 它会激活副交感神经系统，触发您的身体进入休息模式。

Go for a 15 minute walk every morning. You don't need a fancy morning routine—just go for a walk. The sunlight, movement, and fresh air have a direct positive impact on your mood, circadian rhythm, metabolism, digestion, and more. Leave the phone at home. Let your mind wander.

每天早上步行 15 分钟。 你不需要花哨的早晨例程——去散散步就可以了。 阳光、运动和新鲜空气对您的情绪、昼夜节律、新陈代谢、消化等有直接的积极影响。 把电话留在家里。 让你的思绪漫游。

To get your body moving to start the day, try the 5-5-5-30 morning routine: when you wake up, do 5 push-ups, 5 squats, 5 lunges, and a 30-second plank. You can do it while you are brewing coffee or right when you get out of bed. It will jumpstart your metabolism and give you a boost of energy to start the day.

为了让您的身体动起来开始新的一天，请尝试 5-5-5-30 的早晨例程：当您醒来时，做 5 个俯卧撑、5 个下蹲、5 个弓步和一个 30 秒的平板支撑。 您可以在煮咖啡时或刚起床时进行操作。 它会快速启动您的新陈代谢，让您精力充沛地开始新的一天。

To eat healthier, do all of your shopping on the outer perimeter of the grocery store. The outer perimeter typically has all of the fresh produce, meats, fish, dairy, etc. The middle aisles have all of the processed stuff. If you're trying to eat clean, stay on the outside.

为了吃得更健康，请在杂货店外围购物。 外围通常有所有新鲜农产品、肉类、鱼类、奶制品等。中间过道有所有加工过的东西。 如果你想吃得干净，那就呆在外面。

If you’re trying to lose weight or lean out, do 25 jump ropes between each set of exercises at the gym. It's an easy way to burn an extra ~100-200 calories per day and doesn't create the mental drag of boring cardio.

如果您想减肥或瘦身，请在健身房的每组练习之间做 25 次跳绳。 这是一种每天额外燃烧约 100-200 卡路里的简单方法，并且不会产生无聊的有氧运动的精神拖累。

## Money Hacks

## 钱黑客

Be frugal with yourself and generous with others.

对自己要节俭，对别人要慷慨。

If an investment or financial opportunity seems too good to be true, assume that it probably is. Remember: There’s no such thing as a free lunch.

如果一项投资或财务机会好得令人难以置信，请假设它可能是真的。 请记住：天下没有免费的午餐。

Create an automated direct deposit for a small amount of money into an investment account every month. Never look at the account. Don't pay any attention to it. A $100 monthly investment into the S&P 500 for the last 10 years would be worth ~$20,000 today. Let it compound.

每个月将少量资金自动直接存入投资账户。 永远不要看账目。 不要理会它。 在过去 10 年中，每月向标准普尔 500 指数投资 100 美元，今天的价值约为 20,000 美元。 让它复合。

Tip 30%+ around the holidays. Give a small holiday gift to any service industry workers you regularly encounter (delivery drivers, trash pickup, cleaners, etc.). It's greatly appreciated by those on the receiving end of it. A simple way to spread some positive holiday vibes.

假期前后给小费 30%+。 向您经常遇到的任何服务行业工作人员（送货司机、垃圾清理员、清洁工等）赠送一份小节日礼物。 收到它的人非常感谢它。 传播一些积极的节日氛围的简单方法。

Treat your credit card like a debit card—assume the money is leaving your bank account when you swipe it. Pay it off entirely every month.

像对待借记卡一样对待您的信用卡——假设当您刷卡时钱会从您的银行账户中转出。 每个月全部还清。

Tip the bartender at your local bar very graciously the first time you go. You'll get better service and build a relationship that will last.

第一次去当地酒吧时，请非常亲切地给酒保小费。 您将获得更好的服务并建立持久的关系。

If someone uses a bunch of fancy words and jargon to try to sell you an investment or financial opportunity, don’t buy it. Then run the other direction, fast.

如果有人使用一堆花哨的词和行话试图向您推销投资或财务机会，请不要购买。 然后向另一个方向跑，速度快。
