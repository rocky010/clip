## **一个新的 AI 词典：性别**

## **Transgender erasure in AI: Binary gender data redefining ‘gender’ in data systems**

A guest post by Brindaalakshmi. K. Brindaa is an intersectional queer-feminist writer, researcher and advocacy professional. They work at the intersection of human rights, identities, and technology. Their research and advocacy efforts are informed by their work as a queer and trans rights activist and peer supporter working with the LGBTIQA+ community in India.

This essay is part of our ongoing “[AI Lexicon](https://medium.com/a-new-ai-lexicon/launching-a-new-ai-lexicon-responses-and-challenges-to-the-critical-ai-discourse-e43a03512f14)” project, a call for contributions to generate alternate narratives, positionalities, and understandings to the better known and widely circulated ways of talking about AI.

Recent conversations around gender and AI have centred around the need to understand gender beyond the binary of male and female. For example, facial recognition technology used by Uber in the US has problems with correctly recognising transgender persons (see [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/08/transgender-uber-driver-suspended-tech-oversight-facial-recognition.html) and [here](https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-block-deadname-some-transgender-drivers-account-photo-update-app-2021-12)). Yet Uber is no exception. The U.S. National Science Foundation, for example, has [highlighted research](https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=299486) that shows that “facial analysis services performed consistently worse on transgender individuals, and were universally unable to classify non-binary genders.”

最近关于性别和AI 的对话主要围绕着超越男性和女性二元论来理解性别的需求。 例如，美国优步使用的面部识别技术在正确识别变性人方面存在问题（参见 [此处](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/08/transgender-uber-driver-suspended-tech-oversight-facial-recognition.html) 和 [此处](https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-block-deadname-some-transgender-drivers-account-photo-update-app-2021-12) ）。 然而优步也不例外。 例如，美国国家科学基金会 [强调了一项研究，该研究](https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=299486) 表明“面部分析服务对变性人的表现一直较差，并且普遍无法对非二元性别进行分类。”

According to CNN Business,¹ “_The way a computer sees gender isn’t always the same way people see it._ A _growing number of terms for describing one’s gender are becoming common in everyday life.”_ The article cites a lack of sufficient training data to recognise transgender persons, and mentions several recent efforts by private companies and the state to include a third gender category including the recent addition of a third gender category on driver’s license in several states in the US. “_As these societal changes proliferate, AI-driven conclusions have become more than a gender identity concern._”

据 CNN Business 报道，¹“ _计算机看待性别的方式并不总是与人们看待它的方式相同。_ 越来越多的描述一个 _人性别的术语在日常生活中变得越来越普遍。”_ 文章指出缺乏足够的培训数据来识别变性人，并提到私营公司和国家最近为纳入第三性别类别所做的几项努力，包括最近在美国几个州的驾照上增加了第三性别类别。 “ _随着这些社会变化的激增，人工智能驱动的结论已不仅仅是性别认同问题。_ ”

Indeed, in _4 Ways to Address Gender Bias in AI,²_ Josh Feast notes that incomplete or ‘skewed training datasets’ are created when demographic categories are missing from the training data: “_Models developed with this data can then fail to scale properly when applied to new data containing those missing categories.”_ And many models fail to include data on transgender persons.

事实上，在 _解决 AI 中性别偏见的 4 种方法²中，_ Josh Feast 指出，当训练数据中缺少人口统计类别时，会创建不完整或“倾斜的训练数据集”：“ _使用此数据开发的模型在应用时可能无法正确扩展到包含那些缺失类别的新数据。”_ 许多模型都没有包含变性人的数据。

While non-binary gender identities have been present in global south countries for some time, the struggles of gender minorities persist. With respect to Gender and AI, these struggles begin with the process of recognising one’s gender identity through data. Presently, gender data from the global south remains incomplete and invisible — It gets lost in the local activism to expand the understanding of gender rights beyond the binary of male and female in an attempt to include centuries’ old indigenous realities; while also erasing and ignoring their hard-won (indigenous) gender recognition simply to remain relevant and be included within the western development paradigm. The definition for the broad western category of LGBTQ+ subsumes, and often even erases the experiences of transgender persons of indigenous identities from a global south country with colonial history like India.

虽然非二元性别认同在全球南方国家已经存在了一段时间，但性别少数群体的斗争依然存在。 关于性别和人工智能，这些斗争始于通过数据识别一个人的性别认同的过程。 目前，来自全球南方的性别数据仍然不完整且不可见——它迷失在当地的激进主义中，试图将对性别权利的理解扩展到男女二元之外，以试图包括几个世纪以来的土著现实； 同时也抹去和忽视他们来之不易的（本土的）性别认同，只是为了保持相关性并被纳入西方发展范式。 广泛的西方 LGBTQ+ 类别的定义包含，甚至经常抹杀来自像印度这样具有殖民历史的全球南方国家的土著身份跨性别者的经历。

**With this as the context, this essay focuses on gender data and the severely lacking frameworks for guaranteeing transgender rights.** Global conversations around gender gap only account for the gap between men and women. Transgender persons and their continued invisibilisation due to the lack of data on their (non-western) realities continues to keep them in a data vacuum.

**以此为背景，本文关注性别数据和严重缺乏保障跨性别者权利的框架。** 围绕性别差距的全球对话只说明了男女之间的差距。 由于缺乏关于他们（非西方）现实的数据，跨性别者和他们的持续隐身化继续使他们处于数据真空中。

I specifically explore transgender data rights in the context of India and its recent (lacking) efforts to create more inclusive data framework. I argue that that we should account for the historical marginalisation faced by this population due to the pathologisation and criminalisation of their gender identity that began during British colonisation in India. Gender data currently accounts only for individuals who identify their gender within the binary genders of male and female, which leads to continued exclusion of transgender persons who identify beyond the binary. I also delve into the unique situation in India (and many other South Asian countries) — the recognition and challenges of a third gender category, as well as the challenges faced by transgender persons who identify within the binary genders. This essay pushes for data systems to reimagine the understanding of gender data to account for individuals beyond the binary — one that is based on an individual’s right to self-identify their gender without the need for a medical certification or complicated bureaucracy.

我专门探讨了印度背景下的跨性别数据权利及其最近（缺乏）创建更具包容性的数据框架的努力。 我认为，由于英国在印度的殖民统治期间开始对他们的性别认同进行病态化和刑事化，我们应该考虑到这一人口所面临的历史边缘化。 性别数据目前仅考虑在男性和女性二元性别中识别其性别的个人，这导致持续排除识别超出二元性别的跨性别者。 我还深入研究了印度（以及许多其他南亚国家）的独特情况——第三性别类别的认可和挑战，以及认同二元性别的跨性别者所面临的挑战。 本文推动数据系统重新构想对性别数据的理解，以解释二进制之外的个人——一种基于个人自我识别其性别的权利，无需医疗证明或复杂的官僚机构。

## **Pathologisation: selective agency to enter data systems**

## **病理化：进入数据系统的选择性机构**

In most countries, individuals are required to provide proof of name, address, and gender (assigned at birth) in order to access welfare benefits. Yet these documents, nor the systems they interact with, rarely acknowledge transgender rights and many transgender people are left without access to systems. Further, in many countries, it’s difficult or even illegal for transgender persons to change gender.

在大多数国家/地区，个人需要提供姓名、地址和性别（出生时指定）的证明才能获得福利。 然而，这些文件，以及它们与之交互的系统，很少承认跨性别者的权利，许多跨性别者无法访问系统。 此外，在许多国家，跨性别者改变性别是困难的，甚至是非法的。

According to the third edition of ILGA’s _Trans Legal Mapping Report_ (a global report on the status of legal gender recognition of transgender persons),³ only 96 countries have legal processes to allow transgender persons to change gender, with only 25 countries described as not having prohibitive requirements. Even with the declassification of gender dysphoria as a mental disorder, a demand for medical certification in some form to change identification documents continues across many countries. The need for a medical validation and authorization — a form of continued pathologization — impacts the understanding of individual agency and an individual’s ability to self-identify their gender identity in different identification documents and enter data systems as a valid human being to access their rights. This continues to alienate transgender experiences from the common collective understanding of gender and as a data category, and consequently, from gender data. With increased push to digitise identification processes to enable interoperability of data systems, the inability of an individual to enter a data set due to the lack of a valid ID or data mismatch also impacts the size of the gender datasets that may be used to train automated decision-making systems using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning.

根据 ILGA 的第三版 _跨性别法律映射报告_ （一份关于跨性别者法律性别承认现状的全球报告）³，只有 96 个国家拥有允许跨性别者改变性别的法律程序，只有 25 个国家被描述为没有禁止性要求。 即使将性别不安归类为精神障碍，许多国家仍然要求以某种形式提供医疗证明以更改身份证件。 对医学验证和授权的需求——一种持续病理化的形式——影响了对个体机构的理解以及个人在不同身份证件中自我识别其性别身份并作为有效人进入数据系统以获取其权利的能力。 这继续将跨性别经历从对性别的共同集体理解和作为数据类别，从而从性别数据中疏远。 随着越来越多地推动数字化识别过程以实现数据系统的互操作性，个人由于缺乏有效 ID 或数据不匹配而无法输入数据集也会影响可用于训练自动化的性别数据集的大小使用人工智能 (AI) 和机器学习的决策系统。

## **Decolonising the understanding of (trans) gender in data systems**

## **数据系统中对（跨）性别的理解去殖民化**

In addition to pathologisation, transgender experiences from the global south are often misrepresented due to the superimposition of a western understanding of being transgender, which often remains within the binary gender framing — trans woman and trans man. Additionally, while there are many global development data efforts to bridge the gender gap — including SDG 5, Human Development Report 2019,⁴ and Data2X⁵ — it appears that transgender identities are presently only included within the umbrella of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI), and not considered under gender while assessing gender gap.

除了病态化之外，由于叠加了西方对变性的理解，南半球的变性经历也经常被歪曲，而这种理解通常仍处于二元性别框架内——跨性别女人和跨性别男人。 此外，虽然有许多全球发展数据努力弥合性别差距——包括可持续发展目标 5、2019 年人类发展报告⁴和 Data2X⁵——但跨性别身份目前似乎仅包含在性取向和性别认同 (SOGI) 的范畴内，并且在评估性别差距时未在性别下考虑。

However, in the context of India, understanding transgender identities and gender data can be complex — one that doesn’t fit the homogenised understanding of being transgender or LGBTIQ+. The imagination of global development data efforts leave no room for the indigenous transgender identities beyond the binary genders — unique to India. India has a strong presence of indigenous transgender identities such as hijra, kinnar, jogappas, among others. British colonial laws have had a significant impact on the rights of transgender persons in the country. Transgender persons were subject to state surveillance using the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 which called for “surveillance and control of certain criminal tribes and eunuchs.”⁶ It is important to take this history of suspicion and surveillance into account while understanding gendered experiences specific to transgender persons in the region and its continued impact in the present realities of transgender persons. This surveillance persists even today with the indiscriminate demand for a medical certificate only from transgender persons (to identify within the binary genders). Cisgendered persons are not subject to such unreasonable requirements. Using the colonial ideas of pathologisation and criminal suspicion, the state continues to question the human-ness of transgender persons to procure a valid identification document as a human being. By way of such vile practices, the state continues to control certain bodies and the sufficiency for them to even exist as a person, let alone enter a data system, training data sets, and the imagination of AI.

然而，在印度的背景下，理解跨性别身份和性别数据可能很复杂——这不符合对跨性别或 LGBTIQ+ 的同质化理解。 全球发展数据工作的想象力没有为印度独有的二元性别之外的土著跨性别身份留下空间。 印度拥有大量本土跨性别身份，例如 hijra、kinnar、jogappas 等。 英国殖民地法律对该国变性人的权利产生了重大影响。 根据 1871 年的《犯罪部落法》，跨性别者受到国家监视，该法案要求“监视和控制某些犯罪部落和太监”。该地区的人及其对跨性别者当前现实的持续影响。 这种监视甚至在今天仍然存在，不分青红皂白地要求跨性别者提供医疗证明（以识别二元性别）。 顺性别者不受此类不合理要求的约束。 利用病态化和犯罪嫌疑的殖民思想，国家继续质疑变性人的人性，以获取作为人的有效身份证件。 通过这种卑鄙的做法，国家继续控制某些身体以及他们作为一个人存在的充分性，更不用说进入数据系统、训练数据集和人工智能的想象力了。

In the section below, I build on work I did for the study ‘_Gendering of Development Data in India: Beyond the Binary’,⁷_ using India as a case study to trace the structural and systemic challenges with transgender data and the resultant rights exclusions faced by transgender persons identifying within and outside the gender binary. While the insights drawn below are from India, they are largely representative of the current state of global approaches to development data, understandings of gender, and consequently, gender equality.

在下面的部分中，我以我为研究“ _印度发展数据的性别化：超越二元性”所做的工作为基础，⁷ 以_ 印度为案例研究来追踪跨性别数据面临的结构性和系统性挑战以及由此产生的权利排除由变性人在二元性别之内和之外识别。 虽然下面的见解来自印度，但它们在很大程度上代表了全球发展数据方法、对性别的理解以及由此产生的性别平等的现状。

## **Status of genders beyond the binary in the India’s development data**

## **印度发展数据中超越二元的性别地位**

Building on Feast’s idea of missing data and data categories, a central issue with AI systems is that they are trained to make decisions based on large scale data sets that contain a limited view of individuals. Training AI systems about the understanding of transgender persons would require such data sets on transgender persons. In India, the data sets available on transgender persons (e.g., the 2011 census data)⁸ are skewed and insufficient to automate decision making systems that will be inclusive of transgender realities. This limited data has resulted in insufficient budgeting and lack of programmes in several Indian states. Understanding data exclusion requires a closer look at the law, policy, and practice in India. Historically, transgender persons have faced severe discriminations and marginalisation in India.

基于 Feast 关于缺失数据和数据类别的想法，AI 系统的一个核心问题是它们经过训练可以根据包含有限个人视图的大规模数据集做出决策。 训练 AI 系统了解变性人将需要此类关于变性人的数据集。 在印度，有关跨性别者的可用数据集（例如，2011 年人口普查数据）⁸ 存在偏差，不足以使包含跨性别现实的决策系统自动化。 这种有限的数据导致印度几个邦的预算不足和缺乏计划。 了解数据排除需要仔细研究印度的法律、政策和实践。 从历史上看，跨性别者在印度曾面临严重的歧视和边缘化。

-   **Enumeration of transgender persons: Prior to 2011, the Indian census did not recognize transgender persons.** Census 2011 was the first census to enumerate transgender persons in India, yet under the gender category of ‘Others.’ This general classification has left it unclear who fits into this category, and has resulted in several issues with the data collected (e.g., undercounting). This flawed dataset is being used as the primary data for fund allocation across different states for transgender people’s inclusion, leading to misallocation and under-allocation of funds for development priorities addressing the needs of transgender persons across India.
-   **跨性别者统计：2011年之前，印度人口普查不承认跨性别者。** 2011 年人口普查是印度首次对变性人进行枚举，但将其归入“其他”性别类别。 这种一般分类使谁属于这一类别变得不清楚，并导致收集的数据出现几个问题（例如，统计不足）。 这个有缺陷的数据集被用作不同州跨性别者包容的资金分配的主要数据，导致资金分配不当和分配不足，用于满足印度跨性别者需求的发展优先事项。
-   **Legal framework:** Subsequently, in 2014, the Supreme Court of India for the first time recognised the right of an individual to self-identify their gender as male, female, or transgender.⁹ This verdict also detailed nine directives to be implemented for the inclusion of transgender persons in the country. However, these directives were not uniformly implemented across the country. Further, in 2019, despite severe opposition¹⁰ from the transgender community, the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2019¹¹ was passed — supposedly to protect the rights of transgender persons. In reality, this new law demands a medical certificate for transgender persons to identify within the binary.¹² This disproportionately affects the ability of transgender individuals to disclose their gender identity.
-   **法律框架：** 随后，在 2014 年，印度最高法院首次承认个人有权将自己的性别认定为男性、女性或变性人。⁹ 该判决还详细说明了九项指令，以便将其纳入该国的变性人。 但是，这些指令并未在全国统一实施。 此外，在 2019 年，尽管跨性别者社区的强烈反对¹⁰，还是通过了《2019 年跨性别者（权利保护）法案》¹¹——据称是为了保护跨性别者的权利。 实际上，这项新法律要求跨性别者提供医疗证明以在二进制文件中进行身份识别。12 这不成比例地影响了跨性别者披露其性别身份的能力。
-   **Policy:** Even with efforts to institutionalize transgender rights into law, there is often a large gap between what the laws say and how — if at all — they are implemented. Based on the census data, some states like Meghalaya cited the lack of transgender persons for the lack of a policy.
-   **政策：** 即使努力将跨性别者权利制度化为法律，法律规定与实施方式（如果有的话）之间往往存在很大差距。 根据人口普查数据，梅加拉亚邦等一些州称缺乏跨性别者是因为缺乏政策。

Another repeated issue is the move to digital welfare services alongside a lack of digital literacy and low literacy among transgender persons owing to a high rate of school dropouts.¹³ There are no provisions for transgender persons with no internet access, smartphone, or digital literacy. It is either an offline process facing the prejudices of government official or an online process with no support. The disproportionate emphasis on data shifts the burden of proof onto the transgender individuals even under dire circumstances for the sake of inclusion. This shift also reflects a change in priority from human rights onto data.

另一个反复出现的问题是转向数字福利服务，同时由于辍学率高，跨性别者缺乏数字素养和识字率低。¹³没有针对没有互联网接入、智能手机或数字素养的跨性别者的规定。 它要么是一个面临政府官员偏见的离线过程，要么是一个没有支持的在线过程。 对数据的过分强调将举证责任转移到变性人身上，即使是为了包容而在可怕的情况下也是如此。 这种转变也反映了优先权从人权到数据的变化。

-   **Practice**: Transgender persons face marginalisation in accessing their basic rights including but not limited to healthcare, housing, banking, education, employment, among others. Given the stigma around being transgender in India and the discriminatory nature of the new law, the mandatory requirement for any individual to first identify as transgender as their gender on their ID before changing to a binary gender¹⁴ will further discourage individuals from disclosing their identity. In essence, the new law will worsen the situation for transgender persons in the country, their enumeration, and access to constitutionally guaranteed human rights and the size of datasets that are fed into automated decision-making systems.
-   **做法** ：跨性别者在获得基本权利方面面临边缘化，包括但不限于医疗、住房、银行、教育、就业等。 考虑到印度变性人的耻辱感以及新法律的歧视性质，强制性要求任何人在更改为二元性别之前必须首先在身份证上确定自己的性别是变性人¹⁴，这将进一步阻止个人公开自己的身份。 从本质上讲，新法律将使该国跨性别者的处境、他们的查点、获得宪法保障的人权以及输入自动决策系统的数据集的规模恶化。

Even with India’s attempts to include transgender persons, the use of skewed training datasets are evidently creating issues of scaling due to significant data mismatches. Until 2017, the application to apply for a Permanent Account Number (PAN) did not have a third gender. However, transgender persons with a digital ID/Aadhaar as transgender were expected to link it with their PAN. The system did not allow for this linking due to a gender category mismatch. This was resolved only after the Supreme Court of India ordered for the inclusion of an additional gender category.¹⁵ Evidently, the welfare system in India has not been structured or equipped to be inclusive of transgender persons resulting in ‘skewed training datasets’ to be fed in Automated Decision Making Systems (ADMS). The Government of India recently admitted to having no plans to pass a law¹⁶ or regulate the use of Artificial Intelligence in India. As noted by Feast, this continued ‘skewed training datasets’ will lead to scaling challenges — in the case of a welfare state, this translates into implementation challenges. The use of skewed datasets in an unregulated environment — no law to regulate AI neither to protect an individual’s privacy — is likely to worsen the status of transgender persons in the country.

即使印度试图将跨性别者包括在内，但由于严重的数据不匹配，使用倾斜的训练数据集显然会产生缩放问题。 直到2017年，申请永久账号（PAN）的申请都没有第三性别。 然而，作为跨性别者，拥有数字 ID/Aadhaar 的跨性别者应该将其与他们的 PAN 联系起来。 由于性别类别不匹配，系统不允许此链接。 只有在印度最高法院下令加入一个额外的性别类别后，这个问题才得到解决。¹⁵ 显然，印度的福利系统的结构或配备不适合跨性别者，导致提供“倾斜的训练数据集”在自动决策系统（ADMS）中。 印度政府最近承认没有计划通过法律¹⁶ 或规范人工智能在印度的使用。 正如 Feast 所指出的，这种持续的“倾斜训练数据集”将导致规模化挑战——在福利国家的情况下，这转化为实施挑战。 在不受监管的环境中使用倾斜的数据集——既没有法律来监管人工智能，也没有法律来保护个人隐私——可能会恶化该国跨性别者的地位。

## **Conclusion: Need to reimagine gender as a data category**

## **结论：需要将性别重新想象为一个数据类别**

Presently, the onus continues to be on the marginalised to contend with systems and initiatives that fail to identify people beyond the binary genders.¹⁷ For example, the explicit mention of women and girls in the framing of SDG 5 encodes gender inequality in leading development frameworks, making it harder to hold states accountable. With the advent of AI-based technology systems and big data for decision-making, transgender people face amplified challenges of pathologization and criminalisation. Considering the nature of AI and machine learning to generate algorithms based on voluminous data related to specific keywords, the reframing of the word gender becomes critical. The understanding of gender needs to be expanded to include gender-diverse individuals without explicit mentions of specific identities. More importantly, these frameworks need to include transgender realities from the global south. The reframing needs to be based on human rights, moving away from the need for representation, which often tends to demand data.

目前，边缘化群体仍然有责任应对无法识别二元性别以外人群的系统和举措。¹⁷ 例如，在可持续发展目标 5 的框架中明确提及妇女和女童在主要发展框架中编码了性别不平等，使追究国家责任变得更加困难。 随着基于 AI 的技术系统和用于决策的大数据的出现，跨性别者面临着病态化和刑事化的更大挑战。 考虑到人工智能和机器学习基于与特定关键词相关的大量数据生成算法的本质，重新定义性别一词变得至关重要。 需要扩大对性别的理解，以包括没有明确提及具体身份的性别多样化的个人。 更重要的是，这些框架需要包括来自全球南方的跨性别现实。 重构需要以人权为基础，摆脱通常需要数据的代表性需求。

Simultaneously, gender data use should be limited and re-evaluated based on each specific use case. As a respondent of the study on India¹⁸ notes, “Gender data itself has to be seen in the context of what we are looking at. What is the data that we are collecting and how are we using it? For some other things, gender may not be significant at all.” A Human Rights Based-Approach to Data released by the UN OHCR highlights the need to allow self-identification especially on gender identity¹⁹ due to the extreme discriminations that transgender individuals face. Given the complex challenges faced by transgender persons, disconnected offline data systems made it easier for individuals to access their rights.

同时，应根据每个特定用例限制并重新评估性别数据的使用。 作为印度研究的受访者¹⁸ 指出，“性别数据本身必须在我们正在研究的背景下看待。 我们收集的数据是什么以及我们如何使用这些数据？ 对于其他一些事情，性别可能根本不重要。” 联合国人权高专办发布的基于人权的数据处理方法强调了允许自我认同的必要性，尤其是在性别认同方面¹⁹，因为跨性别者面临极端歧视。 鉴于跨性别者面临的复杂挑战，离线数据系统断开连接使个人更容易获得他们的权利。

Sexual orientation and gender identity are two distinct data categories and both these data sets should be dealt with differently.²⁰ There’s an urgent need to explicitly separate these two data categories in the context of inclusion of gender-diverse people, including but not limited to those who identify beyond the gender binary of female and male in an effort to better redefine gender and gender equality.

性取向和性别认同是两个截然不同的数据类别，这两个数据集应该以不同的方式处理。²⁰迫切需要在包容性别多样化人群的背景下明确区分这两个数据类别，包括但不限于那些谁识别超越女性和男性的性别二元，以努力更好地重新定义性别和性别平等。

As with facial recognition technology, it is important for the global north to continue to demand better systems that recognise transgender persons. But these conversations need to go beyond the age-old narrative that is representative only of the developed world, to also include indigenous non-binary gender realities from the global south. These communities continue to face far-greater struggles due to the historical marginalisation thrust upon them by the western concepts of colonisation and pathologisation. Without the conscious effort to redefine (trans)gender understanding from a global north imagination, gender development in the global south will continue to force-fit itself into a western imagination to fulfil an unrealistic development (funding) agenda far from its everyday reality.

与面部识别技术一样，对于全球北方来说，重要的是继续要求更好的系统来识别变性人。 但这些对话需要超越仅代表发达国家的古老叙事，还需要包括来自全球南方的本土非二元性别现实。 由于西方殖民化和病态化概念强加给他们的历史边缘化，这些社区继续面临更大的斗争。 如果不从全球北方的想象中有意识地重新定义（变性）性别理解，全球南方的性别发展将继续强迫自己适应西方的想象，以实现远离其日常现实的不切实际的发展（资助）议程。
