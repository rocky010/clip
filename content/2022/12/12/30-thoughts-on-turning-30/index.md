I turned 30 today. That's 30 rotations around the sun; 946,707,779 seconds; and 210 dog years (if you believe they don't age on a logarithmic scale).

我今天就30岁了。这相当于绕太阳30圈；946,707,779秒；以及210个狗年(如果你相信它们不会按对数比例变老的话)。

In return for surviving 3 decades, the people in my life have made this an exceptional day for me and I feel loved and appreciated. Thank you all.

作为对我活了30年的回报，我生命中的人让这一天对我来说是一个特殊的日子，我感受到了爱和感激。谢谢大家。

As any good blogger should, I've compiled a list of 30 bits of advice that I've accumulated over the first (hopefully) 1/3 of my life. I hope they serve you well.

正如任何一位优秀的博客作者应该做的那样，我整理了一份30条建议的清单，这些建议是我在人生的前1/3(希望如此)积累起来的。我希望他们能很好地为您服务。

## 1\. Respect is given, not earned  
1.尊重是给予的，而不是赢得的  

The idea that respect is earned is toxic as it assumes the worst in people. Instead, approach every new person with respect (and rescind that respect if necessary).

尊重是赢得的，这种想法是有害的，因为它假设人们会有最坏的一面。取而代之的是，以尊重的态度对待每一个新来的人(如果必要的话，取消这种尊重)。

## 2\. 10 people who love you is worth more than 10,000 people who like you...

2.爱你的10个人胜过喜欢你的1万个人……

...which in turn is worth more than 10,000,000 "followers".  
...这反过来又价值1000多万名“追随者”。  

## 3\. Relationships are an investment  
3.人际关系是一种投资  

In that they require consistent input (as all good investments do). Otherwise it's just a nice gift.

因为它们需要始终如一的投入(就像所有好的投资一样)。否则，这只是一份很好的礼物。

## 4\. Difficult conversations are the most important conversations to have

4.艰难的对话是最重要的对话

Yet we avoid them more than any other kind.  
然而，我们比任何其他类型的人都更避免使用它们。  

## 5\. If you live with others get a dishwasher  
5.如果你和别人住在一起，买一台洗碗机  

This applies to living with a partner or with friends. It'll save your relationship.

这适用于与伴侣或朋友住在一起。这会挽救你们的关系。

## 6\. Exercise regularly  
6.经常锻炼身体  

I know this is fairly obvious, and I've written a [whole essay](https://herman.bearblog.dev/the-best-investment/) about it. It makes every other part of your life better.

我知道这是相当明显的，我已经写了一整篇关于它的文章。它会让你生活的其他部分变得更好。

## 7\. Sugar and caffeine affects mood  
7.糖和咖啡因会影响情绪  

It took me a while to realise how much. Sugar crashes and caffeine anxiety are something that can be controlled. Use these substances wisely.

我花了一段时间才意识到这一点。糖分暴跌和咖啡因焦虑是可以控制的。明智地使用这些物质。

## 8\. Sleep well  
8.睡个好觉  

Natural and artificial light, as well as the comfortability of your bed and many other factors affect your sleep. Figure these out as they contribute to your overall well-being. Most insomnia is solved with some simple sleep hygiene.

自然光和人造光，以及床的舒适性和许多其他因素会影响你的睡眠。当它们对你的整体幸福感做出贡献时，把它们弄清楚。大多数失眠都是通过一些简单的睡眠卫生来解决的。

## 9\. Get into nature often  
9.经常走进大自然  

For both an afternoon walk, and month-long hikes. It's good for the soul.

包括下午散步和长达一个月的徒步旅行。这对灵魂有好处。

## 10\. Take care of your back, joints, and teeth (!)  
10.注意你的背部、关节和牙齿(！)  

Keep your knees kicking and your back mobile. And go to the dentist at least once a year. It's cheaper than the alternative (trust me on this one 💸).

保持膝盖打腿，背部活动。并且每年至少去看一次牙医。这比另一种选择更便宜(相信我在这一款💸上)。

## 11\. You suck at investing  
11.你不擅长投资  

The only way to consistently build wealth over time is to stop trying to game the market ([you can't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbUkmysgXFs)). Instead consistently invest in stable growth.

随着时间的推移，持续积累财富的唯一方法是停止试图玩弄市场(你做不到)。相反，要始终如一地投资于稳定增长。

## 12\. The only way to get rich is to increase your income  
12.致富的唯一途径就是增加收入  

Despite all the personal finance gurus telling you otherwise, you can't save your way to a million (at least not in the foreseeable future). You have to find ways to increase the amount of money coming in (and then you can optimise).

尽管所有的个人理财专家都告诉你不是这样，但你不可能存到100万英镑(至少在可预见的未来是不会的)。你必须找到增加资金流入的方法(然后你才能优化)。

## 13\. No one is going to sell you a way to get rich  
13.没有人会向你兜售致富的方法  

Related to no. 12, all the courses, videos, and books promising the secrets to wealth are just trying to sell you courses, videos, and books.

与第12条有关，所有承诺财富秘诀的课程、视频和书籍都只是在试图向你推销课程、视频和书籍。

## 14\. Crypto started with good intentions and ended as a scam  
14.Crypto一开始用心良苦，最后却成了一场骗局  

I agree with the fundamental premise of a web-first, decentralised currency. I don't think any of us predicted the absolute shit-storm that experiment turned out to be.

我同意网络优先、去中心化货币的基本前提。我不认为我们中的任何一个人预测到那次实验结果会是一场绝对的狗屎风暴。

## 15\. Buy for the long term  
15.长期买入  

I have a few items of clothing that I love, and a bag which will last me forever. This tangentially ties into [Sam Vimes "Boots" theory of socioeconomic unfairness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_theory).

我有几件我喜欢的衣服，还有一个永远可以穿的包。这与萨姆·维姆斯关于社会经济不公平的“靴子”理论密切相关。

## 16\. You don't need to monetise your hobby  
16.你不需要把你的爱好货币化  

This has the potential of turning your hobby into work, and work is work.

这有可能把你的爱好变成工作，工作就是工作。

## 17\. Successful people are lucky  
17.成功人士都是幸运的  

All successful people can attribute most of their success to luck. I respect successful people who recognise this, and am often put off by the _self-made man_ who thinks it was all their doing. That being said, the more lucky you perceive yourself to be, the more lucky you become. **Optimism is powerful shit**.

所有成功的人都可以把他们的成功大部分归功于运气。我尊重那些认识到这一点的成功人士，而那些白手起家的人往往会对他们产生反感，他们认为这都是他们的功劳。也就是说，你觉得自己越幸运，你就变得越幸运。乐观主义是强大的狗屎。

## 18\. Always have something you're working on  
18.总是有一些你正在做的事情  

Humans tend towards consumption to fill our free time (think movies, books, games). More enjoyment can be had through creation.

人类倾向于消费来打发我们的空闲时间(想想电影、书籍、游戏)。通过创造可以获得更多的享受。

## 19\. Writing is thinking  
19.写作就是思考  

Writing is a way of ordering and articulating your thoughts, which helps you understand them better. This inadvertently also makes you a better speaker.

写作是一种整理和清晰表达你的想法的方式，这有助于你更好地理解它们。不经意间，这也会让你成为一名更好的演讲者。

## 20\. Journal every day  
20.每天写日记  

I've written about this [twice](https://herman.bearblog.dev/why-i-journal/) [before](https://herman.bearblog.dev/years-of-journaling/), and it is still one of the most important things I do.

我以前已经写过两次了，这仍然是我做的最重要的事情之一。

## 21\. Curiosity is one of the most interesting attributes a person can have

21.好奇心是一个人可以拥有的最有趣的品质之一

The most interesting person you've ever met is probably extraordinarily curious.

你见过的最有趣的人可能是非常好奇的。

## 22\. Don't be afraid to stand out or go against the grain  
22.不要害怕脱颖而出或背道而驰  

It's where novel ideas and self-expression come from.  
这就是新奇的想法和自我表达的来源。  

## 23\. Celebrate the small things  
23.为小事庆贺  

Our time here is limited. Celebrations are an expression of gratitude. Embrace the opportunity to celebrate.

我们在这里的时间有限。庆祝是对感激的一种表达。抓住这个庆祝的机会。

## 24\. Travel is not that impressive  
24.旅行不是那么令人印象深刻  

Anyone can travel. It's not hard. Many people wear it as a badge. Meh. What's impressive (and takes time and practise) is being excellent.

任何人都可以旅行。这并不难。很多人把它当作徽章佩戴。哼。令人印象深刻的(需要时间和练习)是卓越。

## 25\. Video content is not nuanced  
25.视频内容没有细微差别  

Video is too expensive to produce for nuanced topics. If your only source of information comes from video, you're only scratching the surface (this especially applies to politics and economics). The only example I've seen of an actual deep dive using video is this talk on [NFTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g), and it's over 2 hours long.

为细微差别的主题制作视频太昂贵了。如果你唯一的信息来源来自视频，你只是触及了皮毛(这尤其适用于政治和经济)。我见过的唯一一个使用视频进行真正的深潜的例子是这个关于NFT的演讲，时长超过2个小时。

Both for [individuals](https://herman.bearblog.dev/quitting-social-media/), and for society as a whole.  
无论是对个人还是对整个社会都是如此。  

## 27\. Most things are driven by incentives and economic forces  
27.大多数事情都是由激励和经济力量驱动的  

The news will paint war and upheaval as **someone's** doing. But the truth is (as always) more nuanced.

新闻会把战争和动乱描绘成某人正在做的事情。但事实(一如既往)更加微妙。

## 28\. The world is awful. The world is much better. The world can be much better.

28.这个世界太可怕了。这个世界好多了。世界可以变得更美好。

[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better) summarises this better than I ever could.  
我们的《数据世界》比我更好地概括了这一点。  

## 29\. How to properly clean your glasses  
29.如何正确清洁你的眼镜  

Run your glasses under a warm tap to get all the dust off. Use a small amount of dishwashing liquid to rub the lenses down until they get squeaky under your fingers (this removes all the oil). Dry with a can of compressed air (or a recently laundered cloth). This will clean your glasses better than they have ever been cleaned, and prevents you from scratching them during the cleaning process.

把你的眼镜放在热水龙头下，把所有的灰尘去掉。用少量的洗碗液将镜片擦平，直到它们在你的手指下发出吱吱的声音(这会去除所有的油)。用一罐压缩空气(或最近洗过的布)烘干。这将比以往任何时候都更好地清洁您的眼镜，并防止您在清洁过程中刮伤它们。

## 30\. Things will be okay  
30.一切都会好起来的  

There have been times where I've felt so depressed or heartbroken that I believed that I would never be happy again. It never helps in the moment, but the adage "time heals all wounds" is mostly true. Things will be okay. ❤️

有几次，我感到如此沮丧或心碎，以至于我相信我再也不会快乐了。这在当下是无济于事的，但“时间可以治愈一切创伤”这句格言在很大程度上是正确的。一切都会好起来的。❤️
