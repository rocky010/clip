When I started this new Substack blog, [I wanted to make it explicitly techno-optimist](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/techno-optimism-for-the-2020s). The 2010s felt like a decade in which many Americans — especially in intellectual circles — undervalued and dismissed the promise of technology, [deriding it as “solutionism”](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/09/evgeny-morozov-technology-solutionism-interview), the plaything of out-of-touch techbros, or late capitalism’s scheme to extract more money from hapless consumers. Meanwhile, economists were increasingly enamored with the idea of a [long-term technological stagnation](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fall-American-Growth-Princeton/dp/153661825X), postulating that [we had picked](https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf) most of the Universe’s low-hanging fruit.

当我开始这个新的子栈博客时，我想让它明确地成为技术乐观主义者。2010年代给人的感觉就像是许多美国人--尤其是知识界人士--低估了技术的前景，对技术的前景不屑一顾，嘲笑它是“解决方案主义”、脱离现实的技术经纪人的玩物，或者是晚期资本主义从倒霉的消费者那里榨取更多钱的计划。与此同时，经济学家们越来越痴迷于技术长期停滞的观点，他们假设我们已经摘下了宇宙中大部分容易摘到的果实。

And then 2020 happened. I watched cutting-edge technology help sustain our society through the dark days of the pandemic, and ultimately [defeat that pandemic](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-us-vaccine-rollout-is-world-beating) through near-miraculous vaccines and treatments. At the same time, I saw the long-term menace of climate change suddenly [appear solvable](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/how-we-will-fight-climate-change), thanks to a near-miraculous explosion in [green energy tech](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/climate-change-isnt-that-hard). If that’s solutionism, I’ll have another, and make it a double! And I’m [far from the only person who felt this way](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/techno-optimism-roundup).

然后2020年就发生了。我目睹了尖端技术帮助我们的社会度过大流行的黑暗日子，并通过近乎奇迹的疫苗和治疗最终击败了大流行。与此同时，我看到气候变化的长期威胁突然变得可以解决，这要归功于绿色能源技术近乎奇迹般的爆炸。如果那是解决主义，我要再来一杯，要双倍的！我远不是唯一一个有这种感觉的人。

To some people it may sound ideologically blinkered to gush about technology after a year in which tech stocks took a nose-dive and one whole sector of the industry turned out to be mostly [a self-devouring ouroboros of financial scams](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/what-if-crypto-justdies). But the profits of tech companies are not the same as the social benefit of technology — witness how little profit solar manufacturers make, even though solar is changing the world. And honestly, crypto [isn’t much of a technology yet](https://medium.com/@kaistinchcombe/decentralized-and-trustless-crypto-paradise-is-actually-a-medieval-hellhole-c1ca122efdec); smart contracts may someday change the world, but the scams and Ponzis that exploded this year were innovative only in their techniques of social engineering. More generally, technology doesn’t always mean the same old things improve year after year, forever; [one boom ends, but another begins](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/turning-the-page-on-the-second-tech).

在一些人看来，在科技股暴跌的一年后，大肆谈论科技股听起来可能是意识形态上的盲目行为。在这一年里，科技股暴跌，整个行业基本上都是自食其果的金融骗局。但科技公司的利润并不等同于技术的社会效益--尽管太阳能正在改变世界，但太阳能制造商的利润是多么微不足道。老实说，密码还不是一项很好的技术；智能合同有朝一日可能会改变世界，但今年爆发的骗局和庞氏骗局只是在社会工程技术方面有所创新。更广泛地说，技术并不总是意味着同样的旧事物年复一年、永远地改善；一个繁荣结束，另一个繁荣开始。

A more troubling note is that the burst of productivity that followed the pandemic seems like it might have petered out:

一个更令人不安的问题是，疫情爆发后的生产力激增似乎已经逐渐消失：

My bet is that this is political rather than technological; it probably reflects expensive energy and other disruptions in the wake of the Ukraine war. Fortunately those disruptions are fading; labor productivity did [bounce back in the third quarter](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/total-factor-productivity-tfp/) as energy prices fell. But this is worth keeping an eye on; there are lots of other factors that could weigh on productivity growth, such as [plateauing education levels](https://educationdata.org/college-enrollment-statistics) and [U.S.-China decoupling](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-end-of-the-system-of-the-world).

我敢打赌，这是政治因素，而不是技术因素；这可能反映了乌克兰战争后昂贵的能源和其他干扰。幸运的是，这些干扰正在消退；随着能源价格下跌，劳动生产率在第三季度确实出现了反弹。但这一点值得关注；还有很多其他因素可能会拖累生产率增长，比如教育水平持平和美中国脱钩。

Anyway, whether we end up getting a “roaring 20s” or not, I see lots of technological developments that are either changing our world in major ways already, or seem likely to change it soon.

无论如何，无论我们最终会不会迎来“咆哮的20多岁”，我都看到了许多科技发展，它们要么已经在以重大方式改变我们的世界，要么似乎很快就会改变它。

Obviously, one of the biggest pieces of tech news this year was the release of a bunch of generative AI apps, including art applications like Stable Diffusion and Midjourney, and text generators like chatGPT. The mania this sparked was electric — I’m not sure I can recall ever having seen this sort of mass interest in a new technology from outside the world of nerds and early adopters.

显然，今年最大的科技新闻之一是发布了一系列具有生成性的人工智能应用程序，包括稳定扩散和中途旅行等艺术应用程序，以及ChatGPT等文本生成器。这引发了一种电子狂热--我不确定我曾经见过书呆子和早期采用者之外的人对一项新技术有如此大的兴趣。

That interest doesn’t mean that everyone was happy about the new tech; lots of people were wonderstruck, but many others found reasons to be outraged or terrified. You can witness the dichotomy in the replies to this guy who co-wrote a children’s book with AI:

这种兴趣并不意味着每个人都对这项新技术感到高兴；许多人感到惊讶，但也有许多人找到了愤怒或恐惧的理由。你可以在回复这个与人工智能合写了一本儿童书籍的人的回复中看到这种两极分化：

The negative reactions seem pretty misplaced. Some people accused the guy of “stealing” the work of other artists, because AI art programs often train themselves on copyrighted data. But that seems no different than a human artist gathering inspiration from looking at other people’s works. And we should celebrate tools that open up creative fields to more people; without AI, what are the chances this guy would have created a children’s book on his own?

负面反应似乎相当不合时宜。一些人指责这名男子“窃取”其他艺术家的作品，因为人工智能艺术程序经常用受版权保护的数据来训练自己。但这似乎与人类艺术家从观看他人作品中获得灵感没有什么不同。我们应该庆祝那些向更多人开放创意领域的工具；如果没有人工智能，这个家伙自己创作一本儿童书籍的可能性有多大？

Anyway, I think that co-authorship is exactly the right model for what a lot of human beings are going to be doing with these new AI tools. Roon (an AI engineer) and I wrote up this post about how we expect this to work, and why human workers won’t be rendered obsolete:

无论如何，我认为，对于许多人类将使用这些新的人工智能工具所做的事情来说，合作是正确的模式。Roon(一名人工智能工程师)和我写了一篇文章，讲述了我们对这一技术的预期，以及为什么人类工人不会被淘汰：

But Roon and my post only scratches the surface of what might be possible with new AI tools. Sam Hammond has some interesting thoughts about where the current AI revolution might take us:

但Roon和我的帖子只触及了新人工智能工具可能实现的皮毛。关于当前的人工智能革命可能会把我们带到哪里，萨姆·哈蒙德有一些有趣的想法：

Of course we shouldn’t only focus on generative AI — good old-fashioned _predictive_ AI is still advancing as well, as demonstrated by DeepMind’s [amazing progress in protein folding](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2330866-deepminds-protein-folding-ai-cracks-biologys-biggest-problem/). And there are many cases where the line blurs — if an autonomous robot uses AI to move around, is it predicting where it should go, or generating ideas of where to go? Do we care?

当然，我们不应该只关注生成性人工智能--优秀的老式预测性人工智能仍在进步，DeepMind在蛋白质折叠方面的惊人进步就证明了这一点。而且在很多情况下，界限是模糊的--如果一个自主机器人使用人工智能来移动，它是在预测它应该去哪里，还是在产生去哪里的想法？我们在乎吗？

But the key reason to be optimistic about AI is that _it isn’t slowing down_. In the past, AI development was [marked by repeated “winters”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter) in which both interest and technical progress seemed to slow down. Some researchers, like Gary Marcus, have been [predicting another AI winter soon](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1801/1801.00631.pdf). But the field seems to have blown right past those predictions, both in the quantitative and qualitative senses. Here’s a good thread looking at some quantitative measures of AI interest and performance:

但对人工智能持乐观态度的关键原因是，它并没有放缓。过去，人工智能发展的特点是反复的“冬天”，人们的兴趣和技术进步似乎都放缓了。一些研究人员，如加里·马库斯，一直在预测不久将迎来另一个人工智能冬天。但这一领域似乎已经超越了这些预测，无论是在定量还是定性意义上都是如此。以下是一些衡量人工智能兴趣和性能的量化指标的很好线索：

The one indicator of a slowdown is that [ImageNet training costs have slowed their decline](https://twitter.com/JackSoslow/status/1600552311842959360) since 2018. So we’ll see. But there’s also a lot more to progress than curve fits — innovation proceeds by applying technologies to new _problems_, and here the explosion in generative AI applications really stands out. We’re just not running out of things to have AI do for us.

经济放缓的一个指标是，ImageNet培训成本自2018年以来的下降速度有所放缓。所以我们拭目以待。但除了曲线拟合之外，还有更多的东西需要进步--创新是通过将技术应用于新问题来获得的，而在这里，生成性人工智能应用的爆炸式增长真的很突出。我们只是没有用完人工智能为我们做的事情。

In fact, big new things are in the pipeline. ChatGPT, which so wowed the world, actually uses a fairly “old” technology called GPT-3, which was released in 2020. But OpenAI, the company behind GPT-3, is [hard at work on a new engine called GPT-4](https://towardsdatascience.com/gpt-4-is-coming-soon-heres-what-we-know-about-it-64db058cfd45?gi=15fd2438d45f), and rumor has it that it represents another substantial improvement.

事实上，重大的新事物正在酝酿之中。如此令世界惊叹的ChatGPT，实际上使用的是一项相当古老的技术，称为GPT-3，该技术于2020年发布。但GPT-3背后的OpenAI公司正在努力开发一种名为GPT-4的新引擎，有传言称，它代表着另一项实质性的改进。

Now, I don’t want to be a Panglossian about all the effects of AI on society. Yes, the “robots taking jobs” thing is overblown, but there are tons and tons of historical examples of people using powerful new technologies for destructive purposes. ChatGPT-type programs will obviously be useful for mass disinformation by bad actors, as well as for spam, and there may be an arms race between generative AI and the predictive AIs that are used to catch and stop them. Furthermore, the Ukraine war is showing just how important drones are to modern warfare; when these become AI-driven instead of human-piloted, it will be scary.

现在，我不想在人工智能对社会的所有影响上成为盲目乐观的人。是的，“机器人抢走工作”这件事被夸大了，但历史上人们使用强大的新技术达到破坏性目的的例子数不胜数。ChatGPT类型的程序显然将对不良行为者的大量虚假信息以及垃圾邮件有用，生成性人工智能和用于捕获和阻止它们的预测性人工智能之间可能会出现军备竞赛。此外，乌克兰战争正在表明，无人机对现代战争有多么重要；当它们变成人工智能驱动而不是人类驾驶时，情况将是可怕的。

That said, I think there’s enormous potential for AI to do good for the human race. At its core, AI, like computing in general, is about saving mental labor. If it extends the powers of our minds the way physical technology extended the powers of our bodies, another productivity boom is probably ahead.

也就是说，我认为人工智能为人类做好事的潜力是巨大的。就其核心而言，人工智能和一般的计算一样，都是为了节省脑力劳动。如果它像物理技术扩展我们身体的能力那样扩展我们的思维能力，那么另一轮生产力繁荣可能即将到来。

I talk about energy tech a lot, including in all of these techno-optimism posts, so I’ll just chronicle how much my optimism has been warranted. To start with, the solar revolution is going from theoretical to actual, with a huge surge of global investment. China and the EU are out in front here, but the U.S. is ramping up too, thanks in part to the Inflation Reduction Act. [Here’s the IEA’s latest blockbuster report](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2022/executive-summary) about global renewable electricity generation. And here’s a thread about the report:

我经常谈论能源技术，包括在所有这些技术乐观主义的帖子中，所以我只会记录下我的乐观是多么的有根据。首先，随着全球投资的大幅增长，太阳能革命正从理论走向现实。中国和欧盟在这方面走在了前面，但美国也在加快步伐，这在一定程度上要归功于通胀削减法案。以下是国际能源署关于全球可再生能源发电的最新重磅报告。以下是关于这份报告的一条线索：

What really stood out to me was that the IEA, known for its [hilariously conservative (and wrong) solar forecasts](https://cleantechnica.com/2017/09/06/iea-gets-hilariously-slammed-continuously-pessimistic-renewable-energy-forecasts/) in the past, now predicts that renewables as a whole will actually generate more electricity than either coal or oil five years from now:

真正让我印象深刻的是，过去以保守得可笑(而且错误)的太阳能预测而闻名的国际能源署现在预测，5年后，可再生能源的发电量实际上将超过煤炭或石油：

Solar is forecast to represent the bulk of the new additions.  
据预测，太阳能将占新增设备的大部分。  

That’s pretty amazing. Note that this is exactly what people who looked at the solar cost curve were predicting for years. A lot of people found a lot of reasons to doubt that plunging costs would lead to actual soaring adoption. In this skeptical environment, being able to read some simple curves and make some simple deductions was kind of a superpower.

这真是令人惊叹。请注意，这正是研究太阳能成本曲线的人多年来所预测的。很多人有很多理由怀疑，成本暴跌是否会导致实际使用率飙升。在这个充满怀疑的环境中，能够读懂一些简单的曲线，做出一些简单的推论，是一种超能力。

Which is important, because [battery cost graphs](https://twitter.com/scienceisstrat1/status/1601650732775903232) also show equally amazing cost drops for batteries. Those will help resolve the solar intermittency problem at the daily level, though not at the seasonal level. Luckily, seasonal storage is a good job for green hydrogen, which I wrote a post about a couple months ago:

这一点很重要，因为电池成本图表也显示出同样令人惊讶的电池成本下降。这些将有助于在日常水平上解决太阳间歇问题，尽管不是在季节水平上。幸运的是，季节性储存对绿色氢气来说是一项好工作，我在大约几个月前写了一篇帖子：

And hydrogen will also probably be useful for [a number of other applications](https://twitter.com/NatBullard/status/1600836795867856896), which is cool.

氢可能还会用于其他一些用途，这很酷。

Remember that solar cost drops are important not just because they offer _clean_ electricity, but that they offer the promise of _abundant cheap_ electricity. Digging minerals out of the ground is an activity that tends not to get much cheaper over time. But mass-producing simple things like solar panels does tend to get cheaper, which is what we’ve now seen for decades. Here’s an interesting paper about which technologies do and don’t have learning curves:

请记住，太阳能成本下降之所以重要，不仅是因为它们提供了清洁电力，还因为它们提供了大量廉价电力的承诺。从地下挖掘矿物是一项不会随着时间的推移而变得更便宜的活动。但大规模生产太阳能电池板等简单产品的价格往往会变得更低，这是我们几十年来一直看到的情况。这里有一篇有趣的论文，关于哪些技术有学习曲线，哪些没有学习曲线：

This means we’re not just going to save the planet from destruction; we’re going to get cheaper electricity than we have ever known, as a species. We need to start imagining the things we could do with cheap energy — massive desalination, cleanup of pollutants, aluminum smelting, cheap manufacturing, etc.

这意味着我们不仅要拯救地球免于毁灭；我们将获得比我们作为一个物种所知的更便宜的电力。我们需要开始想象我们可以用廉价能源做的事情--大规模海水淡化、污染物清理、铝冶炼、廉价制造等。

Electricity is especially powerful because you can put it into a battery and move it around. Looking at the graph above, we see that batteries are also one of the technologies expected to have a learning curve. And although batteries do seem to occasionally suffer small temporary cost rises ([including in 2022](https://twitter.com/NatBullard/status/1600149648886231040)), eventually the learning curve has always won out in the end. Which is why I’m extremely excited about the potential of batteries to transform our physical world:

电特别强大，因为你可以把它放进电池里，然后到处移动。看看上面的图表，我们看到电池也是预计会有学习曲线的技术之一。尽管电池似乎偶尔会出现暂时性的小幅成本上涨(包括2022年)，但最终学习曲线总是占上风。这就是为什么我对电池改变我们物理世界的潜力感到非常兴奋的原因：

In addition to providing daily energy storage and replacing internal combustion cars, batteries promise a whole host of other improvements in energy transport. In particular, combining batteries and AI seems likely to herald a robotics revolution — we may finally get that Jetsons robot future we’ve all been waiting for. Batteries are also going to be useful for high-powered, cheap-running appliances — in fact, [I even invested in one company](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/battery-powered-appliances) in this space, called Impulse.

除了提供日常能量储存和取代内燃机汽车外，电池还有望在能源运输方面实现一系列其他改进。特别是，将电池和人工智能结合起来似乎可能预示着一场机器人革命--我们可能最终会得到我们都期待已久的Jetsons机器人的未来。电池也将对高性能、低成本的家用电器有用--事实上，我甚至在这个领域投资了一家名为ImPulse的公司。

And even better _kinds_ of batteries may be on the horizon. For example, a team at the University of Sydney [just claimed a breakthrough in sodium-sulfur batteries](https://reneweconomy.com.au/sydney-uni-hails-low-cost-long-life-sodium-sulphur-battery-with-super-high-capacity/), which could be made without the relatively expensive metals (especially lithium) that go into lithium-iron batteries. I don’t want to hype reports like this too much, but it’s a good reminder that battery technology isn’t just about learning curves and cost drops; there’s plenty of possibility for novel battery technologies, and lots of people are looking into them.

更好的电池可能即将问世。例如，悉尼大学的一个团队刚刚声称在钠硫电池方面取得了突破，这种电池可以在不使用锂-铁电池中相对昂贵的金属(特别是锂)的情况下制造出来。我不想过多地炒作这样的报道，但它很好地提醒人们，电池技术不仅仅是关于学习曲线和成本下降；新的电池技术有很大的可能性，很多人正在研究它们。

Oh, and I’d be remiss not to mention the recent breakthroughs in fusion. The U.S. Department of Energy’s National Ignition Facility, which creates fusion by shooting hydrogen with high-powered lasers to mash it together into helium, [recently achieved a net energy gain](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/12/11/fusion-nuclear-energy-breakthrough/). That doesn’t mean cheap fusion power is right around the corner — they need to get a lot more efficient than that, and solve some other technical issues too. But it does mean that fusion will at some point go from being a punchline (“always 50 years in the future!”) to a world-changing reality. Nor is the NIF the only group working on advanced and novel fusion techniques; I’m especially interested in [Helion Energy’s](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/helion-series-e/) approach, called aneutronic fusion.

哦，如果不提到最近在核聚变方面的突破，我就是玩忽职守了。美国能源部的国家点火设施，通过用高功率激光发射氢气来产生聚变，将氢气混合成氦，最近实现了净能量增长。这并不意味着廉价的聚变能源即将到来--他们需要获得比这更高的效率，并解决其他一些技术问题。但这确实意味着核聚变在某一时刻将不再是一个笑点(“永远是50年后的未来！”)一个改变世界的现实。NIF也不是唯一致力于先进和新颖核聚变技术的小组；我对氦离子能源的方法--非中子核聚变--特别感兴趣。

Anyway, whether we get usable fusion or not soon, it seems certain at this point that a future of abundant cheap portable energy is on the way, one way or another. It’s time to start thinking about how we’ll make use of that bounty.

无论如何，无论我们是否很快得到可用的核聚变，在这一点上，似乎可以肯定的是，以某种方式，丰富廉价的便携式能源的未来正在到来。是时候开始考虑我们将如何利用这笔赏金了。

Biotech is a strange area of technology, for a number of reasons. For one thing, the market is really strange, because purchases of most biotech have to go through the medical system; unlike in cyberpunk TV shows, you can’t just go buy a new arm from the convenience store. That tends to limit innovation, because it takes a very long time to get products to market, and markets are highly circumscribed. (The FDA is [working on improving the situation](https://www.nber.org/papers/w30712), but the basic structure will always remain.)

生物技术是一个奇怪的技术领域，原因有很多。首先，这个市场真的很奇怪，因为大多数生物技术的购买都必须经过医疗系统；与赛博朋克电视节目不同，你不能只是去便利店买一个新手臂。这往往会限制创新，因为将产品推向市场需要很长时间，而且市场是高度受限的。(FDA正在努力改善这种情况，但基本结构将永远保持不变。)

Biotech is also strange because the big advances are happening in a bunch of different directions — mRNA vaccines, synthetic bio, stem cells, Crispr, etc. These are all being enabled, to some extent, by cheap gene sequencing combined with cheap computing (and maybe soon with AI, as DeepMind shows). But there is just a whole lot of human brainpower going into a whole lot of different kinds of biotech, and it’s apparently paying off.

生物技术也很奇怪，因为重大进展正在一系列不同的方向上发生--RNA疫苗、合成生物、干细胞、Crispr等等。在某种程度上，这些都是通过廉价的基因测序和廉价的计算相结合而实现的(正如DeepMind所展示的那样，可能很快就会有人工智能)。但是，在许多不同种类的生物技术中投入了大量的人类智力，而且显然是有回报的。

The always-excellent Derek Thompson [has a good rundown](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/12/technology-medicine-law-ai-10-breakthroughs-2022/672390/) of some of the biggest discoveries and inventions of 2022, and many of these are in bio. For example:

一直很出色的德里克·汤普森对2022年的一些最重大的发现和发明进行了很好的概述，其中许多都是在生物领域。例如：

-   Scientists [created a mouse embryo with a beating heart](https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/12/technology-medicine-law-ai-10-breakthroughs-2022/672390/), using nothing but stem cells. That’s kind of amazing; we can now literally create life. In other stem cell news, we can now [create a human ear from stem cells](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/popular-science-magazine-names-3d-133000473.html) and implant it in living people.
    
    科学家创造了一种心脏跳动的小鼠胚胎，只使用了干细胞。这有点令人惊讶；我们现在真的可以创造生命了。在其他干细胞新闻方面，我们现在可以用干细胞制造人耳，并将其植入活人体内。
    
-   mRNA vaccines just keep rolling along. BioNTech is now [conducting trials for its malaria vaccine](https://www.biopharma-reporter.com/Article/2022/07/12/biontech-set-to-take-malaria-vaccine-into-clinical-trials), which could help defeat the deadliest endemic disease on Earth. Meanwhile, scientists at the University of Pennsylvania may have used mRNA to discover [a universal flu vaccine](https://www.inquirer.com/health/flu-vaccine-mrna-penn-scott-hensley-20221203.html).
    
    信使核糖核酸疫苗只是一直在滚动。BioNTech目前正在对其疟疾疫苗进行试验，该疫苗可能有助于击败地球上最致命的地方病。与此同时，宾夕法尼亚大学的科学家们可能已经使用mrna发现了一种通用的流感疫苗。
    
-   Effective new cancer therapies are emerging at a dizzying pace. This year’s standouts used immunotherapy to [make rectal cancer disappear](https://www.mskcc.org/news/rectal-cancer-disappears-after-experimental-use-immunotherapy), and a monoclonal antibody to [fight breast cancer](https://www.icr.ac.uk/news-archive/new-targeted-drug-shows-benefit-against-breast-cancer-in-first-phase-iii-trial).
    
    有效的新癌症疗法正在以令人眼花缭乱的速度出现。今年的优胜者使用了免疫疗法来使直肠癌消失，并使用了一种单克隆抗体来对抗乳腺癌。
    

Meanwhile, steady progress in [synthetic biology](https://www.ddw-online.com/global-advances-in-synthetic-biology-20471-202211/) and [Crispr gene editing](https://phys.org/news/2022-10-breakthrough-crispr-effective-safer-gene.html) continue, so I’m optimistic we’ll see some big results in these areas this decade.

与此同时，合成生物学和Crispr基因编辑方面的稳步进展仍在继续，因此我乐观地认为，我们将在本十年内在这些领域看到一些重大成果。

Anyway, these are just three particularly exciting areas of technological progress. There are others — [falling launch costs](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/space-launch-costs-growing-business-industry-rcna23488) (thanks in large part to SpaceX) are transforming the space industry, quantum computing is still [seeing steady advances](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2022-11-09-IBM-Unveils-400-Qubit-Plus-Quantum-Processor-and-Next-Generation-IBM-Quantum-System-Two), and companies are racing to create workable [brain-computer interface implants](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-30/elon-musk-s-neuralink-spawns-a-cluster-of-brain-computer-startups?sref=R8NfLgwS). I predict that no matter what happens to the total factor productivity numbers, I’ll have plenty of new material for these techno-optimism posts throughout the decade.

无论如何，这只是技术进步的三个特别令人兴奋的领域。还有其他因素--不断下降的发射成本(这在很大程度上要归功于SpaceX)正在改变航天行业，量子计算仍在稳步发展，各公司正在竞相创造可行的脑机接口植入物。我预测，无论全要素生产率数据发生什么变化，我都将在未来十年为这些技术乐观主义帖子提供大量新材料。
