This is a big-think, “sweeping overview” sort of post. I find myself writing more of these recently, not because there aren’t little interesting news items or econ papers or debates to focus on, but because big things are happening very fast in the world right now, and I want to try and keep track of them.

这是一个很有远见的帖子，可以说是“一览无余”。我发现自己最近写了更多这样的东西，不是因为没有什么有趣的新闻、经济论文或辩论可供关注，而是因为现在世界上发生的大事非常快，我想试着跟踪它们。

After the end of the Cold War, the United States forged a new world. The driving, animating idea behind this new world was the belief that global trade integration would restrain international conflict. At first this rested on a Fukuyama-type “end of history” theory that political and economic liberalization would follow globalization, but as it became clear that various bureaucratic one-party oligarchies and petrostates (most notably China and Russia) were resistant to the end of history, the hopes for trade became more modest — at least countries that depended on each other economically would not fall into active conflict.

冷战结束后，美国缔造了一个新世界。这个新世界背后的驱动力和活力来自于这样一种信念，即全球贸易一体化将抑制国际冲突。起初，这建立在福山式的“历史末日”理论之上，即政治和经济自由化将伴随全球化而来，但随着各种官僚一党寡头和石油国家(最著名的是中国和俄罗斯)对历史末日的抵制变得明显，贸易的希望变得更加渺茫--至少在经济上相互依赖的国家不会陷入激烈的冲突。

We didn’t just pay lip service to this theory; _we bet the entire world on it_. The U.S. and Europe championed the admission of China into the World Trade Organization, and deliberately looked the other way on a number of things that might have given us reason to restrict trade with China (currency manipulation in the 00s, various mercantilist policies, poor labor and environmental standards). As a result, the global economy underwent a titanic shift. Whereas global manufacturing, trading networks, and supply chains had once been dominated by the U.S., Japan, and Germany, China now came to occupy the central place in all of these:

我们不仅口头上支持这一理论；我们还以整个世界为赌注。美国和欧洲支持中国加入世界贸易组织，并故意对一些事情视而不见，这些事情可能会让我们有理由限制与中国的贸易(00年代的汇率操纵、各种重商主义政策、糟糕的劳工和环境标准)。结果，全球经济经历了一场巨大的转变。尽管全球制造业、贸易网络和供应链曾经由美国、日本和德国主导，但中国现在在所有这些领域占据了核心地位：

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2401117d-1cae-4bba-861d-b650bfd1cd84_1131x538.jpeg)

As of 2021, China’s manufacturing output was [equal to that of the U.S. and all of Europe combined](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-war-economy-sizing-up-the-new).

截至2021年，中国的制造业产出相当于美国和整个欧洲的总和。

There were were always those who fretted about this shift, but too many people were just making too much money from it to upset the apple cart. U.S. manufacturers boosted their profits — and [at least on paper](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/03/how-much-productivity-growth-was-there-during-2007-2009.html), their productivity — by outsourcing production to China, while retail outlets (and consumers) benefitted from a flood of cheap imports. American companies grew their profits massively from grabbing mere slivers of the vast Chinese market, and salivated over the possibility of more. The finance industry reaped the benefits of cheap capital inflows as China bought U.S. assets in order to hold down the value of the RMB in the 2000s. Knowledge workers in the U.S. and Europe benefitted from researching, designing, and marketing the products that China built for us. Production workers in rich countries [lost out big-time](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/impact-chinese-trade-us-employment-good-bad-apocryphal), but this was a price our country was willing to pay. America and our rich-world allies went from being the world’s workshop to being the world’s research park, and the people who had been our factory workers became the janitors and cooks and security guards of that research park.

总有一些人对这种转变感到担忧，但太多人从这种转变中赚了太多钱，以至于不能打乱苹果车。美国制造商通过将生产外包给中国提高了他们的利润--至少在纸面上--而零售店(和消费者)则从大量廉价进口商品中受益。美国公司通过抢占庞大的中国市场的一小部分，大幅增长了利润，并垂涎于更多市场的可能性。在本世纪头十年，中国购买美国资产以压低人民币汇率，金融业从廉价资本流入中获益。美国和欧洲的知识工作者从中国为我们制造的产品的研究、设计和营销中受益。富裕国家的生产工人损失惨重，但这是我们国家愿意付出的代价。美国和我们的富裕世界盟友从世界工厂变成了世界研究园区，曾经是我们工厂工人的人变成了研究园区的看门人、厨师和保安。

This new system meant big compromises for China’s ruling elite as well. For decades they had closed off their society from foreign influences in an attempt to reorder it according to their liking, and opening up to global trade meant relinquishing some of the social control they had fought so hard for. An economy based on foreign direct investment meant a loss of economic control to foreign corporations. And occupying [the low-value middle of the global supply chain](https://www.ide.go.jp/English/ResearchColumns/Columns/2022/meng_bo.html) — the assembly, processing, and packaging that requires enormous mobilization of resources but yields only modest profit margins — put China in danger of falling into the dreaded “[middle income trap](https://www.nber.org/papers/w18673)”.

这一新制度也意味着中国统治精英的重大妥协。几十年来，他们一直将自己的社会与外国影响隔绝，试图根据自己的喜好重新调整社会秩序，而向全球贸易开放意味着放弃一些他们为之奋斗的社会控制权。以外国直接投资为基础的经济意味着外国公司失去了经济控制权。而占据全球供应链的低价值中间环节--需要大量调动资源，但利润率不高的组装、加工和包装--让中国面临落入可怕的“中等收入陷阱”的危险。

But China was simply growing too fast to break this deal. Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao held firmly to the course Deng Xiaoping — who hand-picked them as his successors — had laid out for them. Economically, China pursued “reform and opening up”, while militarily and diplomatically it chose to “hide its strength and bide its time”.

但中国成长得太快了，不能破坏这笔交易。江泽民和胡锦涛坚持邓小平为他们制定的路线--邓小平亲手挑选了他们作为接班人。在经济上，中国奉行“改革开放”，而在军事、外交上，则选择“埋头苦干、伺机而动”。

Some called the world system of the 2000s and early 2010s “[Chimerica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimerica)”. During these years, the hope that global trade would lead to a cessation of great-power conflict, even without ideological alignment, seemed justified. And although China’s politics didn’t liberalize, under Jiang and Hu the country [became more open](https://www.brookings.edu/book/middle-class-shanghai/) to foreign travelers, foreign workers, and foreign ideas. This might not have been the End of History, but it was a compromise most people could live with for a while.

一些人将21世纪头10年和21世纪初的世界体系称为“中美共同体”。在这些年里，希望全球贸易将导致大国冲突的结束，即使没有意识形态上的一致，似乎也是合理的。尽管中国的政治没有自由化，但在江和胡的领导下，这个国家对外国旅行者、外国工人和外国思想变得更加开放。这可能不是历史的终结，但这是一个大多数人可以接受一段时间的妥协。

In the mid-2010s, this compromise began to break down. On the U.S. side, there was increasing anger over the long-term decline of good manufacturing jobs, and an increasing feeling of the U.S. in second place. China, and the Chimerica system, became the target of some of this anger — not without good reason. An increasingly thin, fraying elite consensus in favor of the system snapped when Donald Trump came to power. Trump slapped tariffs on China that raised prices slightly for U.S. consumers and manufacturers, but [hurt China’s economy considerably more](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/impact-us-china-tariff-war-chinas-economy-new-evidence-night-time-lights). The U.S. began to scrutinize and block Chinese investment a lot more under CFIUS, while export controls were put in place to strangle China’s flagship electronics company Huawei. U.S. imports from China shrank, eroding the bilateral trade deficit a bit:

在2010年代中期，这种妥协开始瓦解。在美国方面，人们对良好制造业就业机会的长期下降越来越愤怒，对美国排在第二位的感觉也越来越强烈。中国和中美系统成为了一些愤怒的目标--并非没有充分的理由。当唐纳德·特朗普上台后，支持这一制度的精英们越来越稀薄、日益破裂的共识破裂了。特朗普对中国征收关税，这略微提高了美国消费者和制造商的价格，但对中国的经济损害要大得多。根据美国外国投资委员会的规定，美国开始更多地审查和阻止中国的投资，同时实施出口管制，扼杀中国的旗舰电子公司华为。美国从中国的进口萎缩，略微侵蚀了双边贸易逆差：

Meanwhile, in China, Xi Jinping [initiated a program to onshore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Made_in_China_2025) the production of high-value intermediate goods, even as rising labor costs started to force some low-value labor-intensive assembly work to places like Vietnam or Bangladesh. Xi also [shifted China’s industrial policy](https://dusselpeters.com/CECHIMEX/Naughton2021_Industrial_Policy_in_China_CECHIMEX.pdf) from a regional patchwork to a unified national effort. Foreign direct investment as a percent of China’s economy dropped under Xi:

与此同时，习近平在中国启动了一项计划，将高价值中间产品的生产转移到国内，尽管不断上升的劳动力成本开始迫使一些低价值劳动密集型的组装工作转移到越南或孟加拉国等地。习主席还将中国的产业政策从区域拼凑转变为全国统一努力。在习主席的领导下，外商直接投资占中国经济的百分比下降：

As [Bloomberg’s David Fickling reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-10-18/xi-s-covid-zero-policy-risks-isolating-china-into-a-new-era-of-weakness?sref=R8NfLgwS), trade became a smaller portion of China’s economy over this period:

正如彭博社的大卫·菲克林报道的那样，在此期间，贸易在中国的经济中所占的比例变得更小：

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfd419b4-ee1c-49d4-bfce-f936462aa681_815x618.png)

And yet Chimerica would not be defeated so easily. U.S. imports from China, and the bilateral trade deficit, [rebounded strongly](https://www.statista.com/statistics/187675/volume-of-us-imports-of-trade-goods-from-china-since-1985/) in 2020-21 as a result of the Covid pandemic. The U.S. failed to increase manufacturing production _at all_ under Trump, even as the economy grew quickly.

然而，中美不会那么容易被击败。受Covid疫情的影响，美国从中国的进口和双边贸易逆差在2020-21年间强劲反弹。在特朗普的领导下，美国根本没有增加制造业生产，即使经济快速增长。

![](https_3A_2F_2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_2Fpublic_2Fimages_2F267f1cac-d371-4464-b300-5ad261e7257b_1168x450.png)

Meanwhile, despite an eroding cost advantage, China’s share of global manufacturing grew relentlessly:

与此同时，尽管成本优势正在侵蚀，中国在全球制造业中的份额却无情地增长：

U.S., European, and Asian companies were investing in China at a slightly slower rate, but this is partly because they had already moved so much of their production there. The country’s eroding cost advantage was more than cancelled out by the desire to grab a slightly larger sliver of the vast and growing Chinese market, the need to have factories located close to suppliers, and the country’s vast pool of well-trained process engineers — forces that economists collectively refer to as _agglomeration effects_. And rising costs and increasing government harassment and IP theft didn’t really make multinationals think about divesting; by the late 2010s, companies had simply become used to the idea that their manufacturing would be sourced from China. Making things in China was push-button, it was a no-brainer, it wasn’t something where you got out the Excel spreadsheet to figure out if it penciled. China was simply the “[make-everything country](https://twitter.com/damienics/status/1278114690871300101)”, so that is where you made things.

美国、欧洲和亚洲的公司对中国的投资速度略有放缓，但这在一定程度上是因为他们已经将大量生产转移到了那里。中国不断侵蚀的成本优势被三个因素抵消：在庞大且不断增长的中国市场中抢占更大份额的愿望、将工厂设在离供应商较近的地方的需要、以及中国大量训练有素的工艺工程师--经济学家们将这些力量统称为集聚效应。不断上升的成本、越来越多的政府骚扰和知识产权盗窃并没有真正让跨国公司考虑剥离资产；到2010年代末，企业已经习惯了他们的制造将从中国那里外包的想法。在中国做事情是按下按钮的，这是不需要动脑筋的，不是你拿出Excel电子表格来弄清楚它是不是铅笔的事情。中国简直就是一个“制造一切的国家”，所以你就是在那里制造东西的。

In other words, the vast and inevitable forces of economic agglomeration continued to dictate that China should be the world’s workshop and America (and Europe and Japan) its research park. But there is one force in the global economy more powerful even than agglomeration: Great-power conflict.

换句话说，巨大而不可避免的经济集聚力量继续决定着中国应该成为世界工厂，美国(以及欧洲和日本)应该成为其研究园区。但在全球经济中，有一股力量甚至比集聚更强大：大国冲突。

In 2020 and 2021, a number of events convinced China’s leaders (and many observers in the U.S. and around the world) that China’s system had surpassed the U.S. in terms of economic vitality, political stability, and comprehensive national power. Most of these events were connected to the Covid pandemic. China’s ability to make simple goods like masks and Covid tests, coupled with the U.S.’ struggles in making these things, seemed to validate China’s positioning in the global supply chain. China’s ability to suppress the virus with non-pharmaceutical interventions seemed to demonstrate its higher state capacity. And U.S. unrest in 2020 and early 2021 seemed to suggest a society that was too internally divided to continue to play a central role on the world stage.

2020年和2021年，一系列事件让中国的领导人(以及美国和世界各地的许多观察家)相信，中国的制度在经济活力、政治稳定和综合国力方面已经超过了美国。这些事件中的大多数与Covid大流行有关。中国生产口罩和Covid检测等简单商品的能力，再加上美国的。制造这些东西的艰辛，似乎验证了中国在全球供应链中的地位。中国通过非药物干预抑制病毒的能力似乎表明了其更高的国家能力。2020年和2021年初的美国动乱似乎表明，美国社会内部分歧太大，无法继续在世界舞台上发挥核心作用。

Xi Jinping, China’s leader, apparently felt that these events validated his pre-existing plan for “[great changes unseen in a century](https://www.cfr.org/blog/review-rush-doshis-long-game-chinas-grand-strategy-displace-american-order)” — i.e. China’s displacement of the U.S. as the global hegemon. Though this was Xi’s ambition from the start, it was the Chimerica system that had made his dream feasible, by making China the biggest manufacturing and trading nation on Earth.

中国的领导人习近平显然认为，这些事件证明了他先前提出的“百年未有之大变局”--即中国取代美国成为全球霸主--的计划是正确的。尽管这从一开始就是习的雄心壮志，但正是中美体系让他的梦想变得可行，使中国成为地球上最大的制造和贸易国家。

Now, Xi seemed to feel that China had extracted all it could from the Chimerica system, and that the benefits no longer outweighed the costs. His industrial crackdowns in 2021 included measures to limit Western, Japanese, and South Korean cultural influences. Under his Zero Covid system, China became much more closed to the world, with inflows of people from abroad [basically halted](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-10-18/xi-s-covid-zero-policy-risks-isolating-china-into-a-new-era-of-weakness?sref=R8NfLgwS).

现在，习似乎觉得中国已经尽其所能地从中美系统中榨取了一切，而且好处不再超过成本。他在2021年对工业的打击包括限制西方、日本和韩国文化影响的措施。在他的零度寒流制度下，中国变得更加封闭，国外的人基本上停止了流入。

But these were only the first of a number of ways in which Xi, who just [cemented his absolute power](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/xi-jinping-forever) over his country at the 20th Party Congress, has made it clear that China’s era of “reform and opening up” is over. Here are [some excerpts from an interview with Joerg Wuttke](https://themarket.ch/interview/china-after-the-party-congress-ideology-trumps-the-economy-ld.7703), President of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China about what the changes at the party congress mean:

但这只是习主席在党的二十大上巩固了他对国家的绝对权力的一系列方式中的第一种，他明确表示中国的“改革开放”时代已经结束。以下是中国欧盟商会主席约尔格·伍特克关于党代会上的变化意味着什么的采访节选：

> The reformers have been totally cut off…\[T\]he opening up of the Chinese economy is not going to continue…We have to get away from the idea that China’s policy is still basically tailored to economic growth…Many observers have thought until today that although the Party calls itself Communist, it is basically pursuing a form of Manchester Capitalism. That is over…
> 
> 改革派已经完全切断了…中国经济的开放不会继续…我们必须摆脱中国的政策基本上仍是为经济增长…量身定做的想法直到今天，许多观察家一直认为，尽管共产党自称共产主义，但它基本上是在追求一种形式的曼彻斯特资本主义。这是在…上
> 
> China’s foreign policy will become even more assertive and confrontational. Xi used the word “struggle” seventeen times in his speech to the Party Congress, twelve times in an international context, mostly directed at the USA. China wants to be unassailable and more self-sufficient, it wants to fight for future markets and technologies. In this context, the term struggle also has an absolute claim: There are only winners and losers…The Party leadership shows a similar self-confidence as Germany at the beginning of the 20th century.
> 
> 中国的外交政策将变得更加自信和对抗。习主席在党的全国代表大会上的讲话中使用了17次“斗争”这个词，其中12次是在国际背景下使用的，主要是针对美国。中国想要无懈可击，更加自给自足，它想为未来的市场和技术而战。在这种背景下，奋斗这个词也有绝对的说服力：只有赢家和输家…该党领导层表现出了与20世纪初的德国类似的自信。

Wuttke has every incentive to say that China is still oriented toward economic growth and that the China business environment is still attractive for multinational companies. And yet he is saying the opposite. I tend to believe him. There are a ton of evidence that Xi’s regime is de-prioritizing the foreign businesses whose investment helped build China up to where it is today. As just one example, China’s real estate developers look likely to soak their foreign creditors first:

伍德克完全有理由说，中国仍然以经济增长为导向，中国的商业环境对跨国公司仍然具有吸引力。然而，他说的却恰恰相反。我倾向于相信他。有大量证据表明，习的政权正在将那些投资帮助中国发展到今天的外国企业放在首位。仅举一个例子，中国的房地产开发商看起来很可能会先向外国债权人讨债：

Another small sign is that China has [stopped publishing most of its economic statistics](http://econbrowser.com/archives/2022/10/how-can-one-guide-an-economy-if-one-doesnt-know-where-it-is) — numbers that foreign companies rely on as justification for their decision to invest in the Chinese market.

另一个小迹象是，中国已停止发布其大部分经济统计数据--这些数据是外国公司决定投资中国市场的理由。

Meanwhile, China’s soft support for Russia’s Ukraine invasion and its increasingly aggressive posture toward Taiwan have prompted the Biden administration to pull out the big guns. [Sweeping export controls on the semiconductor industry](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/biden-declares-economic-war-on-the) — covering not just chips, but also chipmaking tools and personnel — represent a zero-sum lunge for the jugular of China’s technological ambitions. For in-depth coverage of just how big a deal this is, I recommend [Chris Miller’s recent interview on the Odd Lots podcast](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-24/odd-lots-podcast-us-puts-new-restrictions-on-china-s-semiconductor-industry?utm_content=economics&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-economics&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&sref=R8NfLgwS). And those export controls may soon be expanded to other technologies:

与此同时，中国对俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的软性支持，以及对台湾日益咄咄逼人的姿态，促使拜登政府拔出了大炮。对半导体行业的全面出口管制--不仅包括芯片，还包括芯片制造工具和人员--代表着对中国科技雄心的零和冲击。要深入报道这件事有多大，我推荐克里斯·米勒最近在The Odd Lot播客上的采访。这些出口管制可能很快就会扩展到其他技术：

([A transcript can be found here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-24/transcript-what-the-us-just-did-to-china-s-semiconductor-industry). And [here is a post by Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2022/chips-and-china/) that goes into even greater detail.)

(成绩单可以在这里找到。下面是本·汤普森的一篇帖子，内容更加详细。)

This makes perfect sense if you view national security and defense as [core to U.S. policymaking](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/natsec-is-how-america-gets-things). The U.S. was willing to tolerate the devastation of its manufacturing base, but not its relegation to a second-class power. In other words, whereas during the Chimerica era both countries prioritized the mutual economic benefits they could get from a symbiotic relationship, they now prioritize the zero-sum military and geopolitical competition to which economics are a key input.

如果你将国家安全和国防视为美国政策制定的核心，这是完全有意义的。美国愿意容忍其制造业基地的破坏，但不愿容忍其沦为二等强国。换句话说，尽管在中美时代，两国都优先考虑从共生关系中获得的互惠经济利益，但现在它们优先考虑零和军事和地缘政治竞争，经济是其中的关键投入。

Markets, for their part, seem to realize that this time is different. [China’s stocks cratered](https://www.asiamarkets.com/chinese-stocks-crash-after-xi-jinping-cements-absolute-power/) after the party congress — so much so that they’re now trading below the value of their assets on paper.

就市场而言，它们似乎意识到这一次不同了。中国的股票在党代会后跌入谷底，以至于现在的股价低于账面上的资产价值。

China’s wealthier citizens also seem to realize that the era of economic focus is over; many are [making plans to flee the country](https://www.ft.com/content/3e2376bf-24ef-407f-b0b0-c60bed4ec97b).

中国的富裕市民似乎也意识到，关注经济的时代已经结束；许多人正在计划逃离这个国家。

The key thing to understand about this decoupling, I think, and the reason it’s for real, is that **this is something the leaders of both the U.S. and China want**. No matter what you heard in 2018, this is _not_ a case of a protectionist U.S. trying to defend its manufacturing industries while China becomes the champion of globalism. The U.S. is acting not out of concern for its industries — indeed, its chip industry will take a huge hit from export controls — but because of how it perceives its own national security. And China’s leaders want to shift to indigenous industry, regulated industry, and even nationalized industry, even if that shift makes China grow more slowly.

我认为，理解这种脱钩的关键是，这是美国领导人和中国都想要的。无论你在2018年听到什么，这都不是一个保护主义的美国试图保护自己的制造业，而中国成为全球主义的捍卫者。美国这样做并不是出于对其产业的担忧--事实上，美国的芯片产业将受到出口管制的巨大打击--而是因为它对自己国家安全的看法。中国的领导人想要转向本土产业、监管产业，甚至国有化产业，即使这种转变会让中国的增长变得更慢。

The decoupling between China and the developed democracies, so long a topic of conversation and speculation, now appears to be a reality. A critical point has been reached. The old world-economic system of Chimerica is being swept away, and something new will take its place.

中国与发达民主国家之间的脱钩，长期以来一直是人们谈论和猜测的话题，现在似乎成了现实。已经到了一个临界点。中美国家的旧世界经济体系正在被扫地出门，取而代之的将是新的体系。

It will take a while for the new world-economic system to be born (and as Gramsci says, this will be a “time of monsters”). A lot will be contingent on events, such as whether there is another [world war](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-i-think-an-invasion-of-taiwan). But already I think we can make some educated guesses and ask some key questions.

新的世界经济体系的诞生还需要一段时间(正如葛兰西所说，这将是一个“怪物时代”)。这在很大程度上将取决于事件，比如是否会有另一场世界大战。但我已经认为，我们可以做出一些有根据的猜测，并提出一些关键问题。

One reasonable prediction is that the era of global value chains will _not_ come to an end. Offshoring and supply chaining are just how companies know how to produce stuff now, meaning that — barring a very catastrophic war — we will not go back to an era of largely self-contained national manufacturing economies. Instead, supply chains will shift into blocs. China is obviously one bloc; Xi and his followers want China to make and own everything valuable in-house and rely on other countries only for raw materials and other low-value goods. In the absence of the U.S.-led liberal world order to enforce free trade, securing those resources will require geopolitical and even military action — a return, in some form or another, to the pre-WW2 era that will doubtless draw at least scattered protests of neo-imperialism. There will be struggles over the resources of some neutral countries, including poor countries, and this could turn into some ugly Cold-War style proxy struggles.

一个合理的预测是，全球价值链的时代不会结束。离岸外包和供应链只是企业现在知道如何生产产品的方式，这意味着--除非发生一场非常灾难性的战争--我们不会回到基本上自给自足的国家制造业经济的时代。取而代之的是，供应链将转变为集团。中国显然是一个集团；习和他的追随者希望中国在国内制造和拥有一切有价值的东西，只依赖其他国家的原材料和其他低价值商品。在没有以美国为首的自由世界秩序来执行自由贸易的情况下，确保这些资源的安全将需要地缘政治甚至军事行动--以某种形式回归到二战前的时代，这无疑会吸引至少零星的新帝国主义抗议。将会有一些中立国家，包括贫穷国家的资源之争，这可能会演变成一些丑陋的冷战式的代理人之争。

The second bloc is less certain. I expect the Biden administration and/or its successor to get tripped up for a while by the mirage of a self-sufficient U.S., and to implement “Buy American” policies that hurt our allies and trading partners and slow the formation of a bloc that can match China. But if Americans can finally pull their heads out of their rear ends and recognize that their country doesn’t dominate the world the way it used to, there’s a chance to create a non-China economic bloc that preserves lots of the efficiencies of the old Chimerica system while also serving U.S. national security needs.

第二个集团就不那么确定了。我预计拜登政府和/或其继任者会被一个自给自足的美国的海市蜃楼绊倒一段时间，并实施伤害我们的盟友和贸易伙伴并减缓形成一个可以与中国匹敌的集团的“购买美国货”政策。但是，如果美国人最终能够清醒过来，认识到他们的国家不再像过去那样主宰世界，那么就有机会创建一个没有中国的经济集团，既保留了旧中美体系的许多效率，又满足了美国国家安全的需要。

That bloc would _not_ only include America’s formal allies or the developed democracies; instead it would include lots of developing countries that would like to hedge against Chinese power and secure access to rich-world markets. Two prime examples are India and Vietnam. I noted [a recent article in The Economist](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/24/the-end-of-apples-affair-with-china) about how Apple — the poster child for American investment in China — is starting to shift production to those countries:

该集团将不仅包括美国的正式盟友或发达的民主国家；相反，它将包括许多希望对冲中国实力并确保进入富裕世界市场的发展中国家。印度和越南是两个最好的例子。我注意到《经济学人》最近的一篇文章，内容是苹果--美国投资中国的典范--正开始将生产转移到这些国家：

> Apple banked on China-based factories, which now churn out more than 90% of its products, and wooed Chinese consumers, who in some years contributed up to a quarter of Apple’s revenue. Yet economic and geopolitical shifts are forcing the company to begin a hurried decoupling…

> 苹果寄望于总部位于中国的工厂，这些工厂现在生产了苹果90%以上的产品，并吸引了中国消费者，在某些年份，中国消费者为苹果贡献了高达四分之一的收入。然而，经济和地缘政治的变化正迫使该公司开始仓促的脱钩…。

> The two countries are the main beneficiaries of Apple’s strategic shift. In 2017 Apple listed 18 large suppliers in India and Vietnam; last year it had 37. In September…Apple started making its new iPhone 14 in India, where it had previously made only older models. The previous month it was reported that Apple would soon start making its MacBook laptops in Vietnam…Almost half its AirPod earphones are made in Vietnam and by 2025 two-thirds will be, forecasts JPMorgan Chase. The bank reckons that, whereas today less than 5% of Apple’s products are made outside China, by 2025 the figure will be 25%…

I would also expect Indonesia, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Mexico, and Turkey to be in this bloc. There will also be some swing states like Malaysia that could go either way and might try to play both sides.

我还预计印尼、孟加拉国、菲律宾、墨西哥和土耳其将加入这一集团。也会有一些摇摆州，比如马来西亚，可能会选择任何一种方式，可能会试图两边都发挥作用。

Between multinational shifts out of China and China’s indigenization of innovation and onshoring of supply chains, the economic relationship between China and developed democracies will stop being a symbiotic one and start to be a competitive one. Instead of being part of a value chain, Chinese and DD companies will go head to head in developing-country markets in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Industrial policy in the DD countries will likely increase in order to maintain key technological edges that are relevant for military advantage.

在中国的跨国转移和中国的本土化创新和供应链本土化之间，中国与发达民主国家的经济关系将不再是共生的关系，而是开始竞争的关系。中国和DD公司将在拉丁美洲、中东和非洲的发展中国家市场正面交锋，而不是成为价值链的一部分。DD国家的产业政策可能会增加，以保持与军事优势相关的关键技术优势。

Meanwhile, the geostrategic competition between the DD countries and the China/Russia axis is obviously going to rely on a lot of export controls. So I expect to see the return of the [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinating_Committee_for_Multilateral_Export_Controls) (CoCom) or some equivalent, and its extension to various new technologies.

与此同时，DD国家和中国/俄罗斯轴心之间的地缘战略竞争显然将依赖于大量的出口管制。因此，我期待看到多边出口管制协调委员会(CoCom)或类似机构的回归，并将其扩展到各种新技术。

Finally, the disengagement from China is not going to be total or abrupt, no matter how much impetus there is in that direction. The DD countries are going to need to decide which products they can afford to keep sourcing from China and which they can’t. This is going to take quite a lot of planning, and it would be _much_ better for the DD countries if they coordinated instead of trying to go it alone.

最后，脱离中国不会是完全或突然的，无论朝这个方向有多大的动力。DD国家将需要决定哪些产品他们可以继续从中国那里采购，哪些他们不能。这将需要相当多的规划，如果DD国家进行协调而不是试图单独行动，情况会好得多。

In fact, whether the non-China bloc coordinates on policy is really the big question regarding the new world-economic order. Together, the U.S., Europe, and the rich democracies of East Asia comprise a manufacturing bloc that can match China’s output and a technological bloc that can exceed China’s capabilities. With the vast populations of India and other friendly developing countries on their side, they can create a trading and production bloc that will be almost as efficient as the old Chimerica system. But this will take coordination and trust on economic policy that has been notably absent so far. The U.S. will have to put aside its worries about competition with Japan, Korea, Germany or Taiwan — and vice versa.

事实上，非中国集团是否在政策上协调一致，确实是世界经济新秩序的大问题。美国、欧洲和东亚富裕的民主国家加在一起，组成了一个可以与中国的产出相媲美的制造业集团和一个可以超越中国能力的技术集团。有了印度和其他友好的发展中国家的广大人口站在他们一边，他们可以创建一个几乎与旧的中美体系一样高效的贸易和生产集团。但这将需要在经济政策上进行协调和信任，而到目前为止，这种协调和信任显然是缺乏的。美国将不得不抛开对与日本、韩国、德国或台湾竞争的担忧--反之亦然。

In any case, this vision — a largely but not completely bifurcated global system of production and trade, with two technologically advanced high-output blocs competing head to head — seems like the most likely replacement for the Chimerica system that dominated the global economy over the past two decades. But it’s only a loose guess. What’s _not_ really in doubt here is that we’ve reached a watershed moment in the history of the global economy; the system we came to know and rely on over the past two decades is crumbling, and our leaders and thinkers need to be scrambling to plan what comes next.

无论如何，这一愿景--一个基本上但并非完全分裂的全球生产和贸易体系，两个技术先进的高产出集团针锋相对--似乎最有可能取代过去20年主导全球经济的中美体系。但这只是一个粗略的猜测。毋庸置疑的是，我们已经到达了全球经济史上的一个分水岭时刻；我们在过去20年中逐渐了解和依赖的体系正在崩溃，我们的领导人和思想家需要争先恐后地规划接下来会发生什么。
