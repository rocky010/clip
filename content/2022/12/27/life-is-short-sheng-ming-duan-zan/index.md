2016 年 1 月  

Life is short, as everyone knows. When I was a kid I used to wonder about this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining about its finiteness? Would we be just as likely to feel life was short if we lived 10 times as long?

人人都知道，人生苦短。当我还是个孩子的时候，我常常想知道这个问题。生命真的很短，还是我们真的在抱怨生命的有限？如果我们的寿命延长 10 倍，我们是否也会同样感到生命短暂？

Since there didn't seem any way to answer this question, I stopped wondering about it. Then I had kids. That gave me a way to answer the question, and the answer is that life actually is short.

由于似乎没有办法回答这个问题，所以我不再想了。然后我有了孩子。这给了我一个回答问题的方法，答案是生命实际上是短暂的。

Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old. If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it's impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.

让孩子们教我如何将连续量、时间转换为离散量。你只有 52 个周末和你 2 岁的孩子在一起。如果 Christmas-as-magic 从 3 岁持续到 10 岁，你只能看着你的孩子经历 8 次。虽然不可能说像时间这样的连续数量是多还是少，但 8 并不是很多。如果你有一把 8 颗花生，或者一架 8 本书可供选择，无论你的寿命有多长，数量肯定看起来是有限的。

Ok, so life actually is short. Does it make any difference to know that?

好的，所以生命实际上是短暂的。知道这些有什么不同吗？

It has for me. It means arguments of the form "Life is too short for x" have great force. It's not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something. It's not just a synonym for annoying. If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.

它对我来说。这意味着“生命对 x 来说太短了”形式的论点具有强大的力量。生命苦短，这不仅仅是一种修辞手法。这不仅仅是烦人的同义词。如果你发现自己认为生命对某件事来说太短暂了，你应该尽可能地消除它。

When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is "bullshit." I realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It's almost the definition of bullshit that it's the stuff that life is too short for. And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character. There's something fake about it. It's the junk food of experience.

当我问自己我发现什么是生命太短暂时，突然出现在我脑海中的词是“胡说八道”。我意识到这个答案有点同义反复。这几乎是废话的定义，它是生命太短暂的东西。然而，胡说八道确实有其独特之处。这有点假。这是经验的垃圾食品。

\[[1](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html#f1n)\] \[1\]

If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit, you probably already know the answer. Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.

如果你问自己把时间花在这些废话上，你可能已经知道答案了。不必要的会议、毫无意义的争论、官僚作风、故作姿态、处理别人的错误、交通堵塞、令人上瘾但没有回报的消遣。

There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's either forced on you, or it tricks you. To some extent you have to put up with the bullshit forced on you by circumstances. You need to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands. Indeed, the law of supply and demand insures that: the more rewarding some kind of work is, the cheaper people will do it. It may be that less bullshit is forced on you than you think, though. There has always been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and go live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional sense, but life feels more authentic. This could become more common.

这种事情有两种方式进入你的生活：要么是强迫你，要么是欺骗你。在某种程度上，你不得不忍受环境强加给你的废话。你需要赚钱，而赚钱主要是跑腿。事实上，供求法则确保：某种工作的报酬越高，人们就越愿意去做。不过，强迫你的废话可能比你想象的要少。总是有一群人选择退出默认的苦差事，去一个传统意义上机会较少的地方生活，但生活感觉更真实。这可能会变得更加普遍。

You can do it on a smaller scale without moving. The amount of time you have to spend on bullshit varies between employers. Most large organizations (and many small ones) are steeped in it. But if you consciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factors like money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will waste less of your time.

您可以在不移动的情况下以较小的规模进行。你必须花在废话上的时间因雇主而异。大多数大型组织（以及许多小型组织）都沉浸在其中。但是，如果你有意识地将避免废话放在金钱和声望等其他因素之上，你可能会找到不会浪费你时间的雇主。

If you're a freelancer or a small company, you can do this at the level of individual customers. If you fire or avoid toxic customers, you can decrease the amount of bullshit in your life by more than you decrease your income.

如果您是自由职业者或小公司，您可以在个人客户层面进行此操作。如果你解雇或避免有毒的客户，你可以减少生活中的废话数量，而不是减少你的收入。

But while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the bullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's fault but your own. And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder to eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you. Things that lure you into wasting your time have to be really good at tricking you. An example that will be familiar to a lot of people is arguing online. When someone contradicts you, they're in a sense attacking you. Sometimes pretty overtly. Your instinct when attacked is to defend yourself. But like a lot of instincts, this one wasn't designed for the world we now live in. Counterintuitive as it feels, it's better most of the time not to defend yourself. Otherwise these people are literally taking your life.

但是，虽然一些废话不可避免地强加给你，但通过欺骗你偷偷溜进你生活的废话不是任何人的错，而是你自己的错。然而，你选择的废话可能比强加给你的废话更难消除。引诱您浪费时间的事情必须非常善于欺骗您。很多人都熟悉的一个例子是在线争论。当有人反驳你时，他们在某种意义上是在攻击你。有时很明显。当你受到攻击时，你的本能是保护自己。但就像许多本能一样，这个本能并不是为我们现在生活的世界设计的。尽管感觉违反直觉，但大多数时候最好不要为自己辩护。否则这些人实际上是在夺走你的生命。

\[[2](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html#f2n)\] \[2\]

Arguing online is only incidentally addictive. There are more dangerous things than that. As I've written before, one byproduct of technical progress is that things we like tend to become

[more addictive](http://paulgraham.com/addiction.html). Which means we will increasingly have to make a conscious effort to avoid addictions — to stand outside ourselves and ask "is this how I want to be spending my time?"

在线争论只是偶尔会让人上瘾。还有比这更危险的事情。正如我之前所写，技术进步的一个副产品是我们喜欢的东西往往会变得更容易上瘾。这意味着我们将越来越需要有意识地努力避免上瘾——站在我们自己之外并问“我想这样度过我的时间吗？”

As well as avoiding bullshit, one should actively seek out things that matter. But different things matter to different people, and most have to learn what matters to them. A few are lucky and realize early on that they love math or taking care of animals or writing, and then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it. But most people start out with a life that's a mix of things that matter and things that don't, and only gradually learn to distinguish between them.

除了避免废话，人们还应该积极寻找重要的事情。但不同的人对不同的事情很重要，大多数人必须了解对他们来说重要的事情。少数人很幸运，他们很早就意识到自己喜欢数学、照顾动物或写作，然后想办法花很多时间去做这些事情。但是大多数人开始的生活都是重要的事情和不重要的事情的混合体，然后才逐渐学会区分它们。

For the young especially, much of this confusion is induced by the artificial situations they find themselves in. In middle school and high school, what the other kids think of you seems the most important thing in the world. But when you ask adults what they got wrong at that age, nearly all say they cared too much what other kids thought of them.

特别是对于年轻人来说，这种困惑很大程度上是由他们发现自己所处的人为情境引起的。在中学和高中，其他孩子对你的看法似乎是世界上最重要的事情。但是当你问大人他们在那个年龄做错了什么时，几乎所有人都说他们太在意其他孩子对他们的看法。

One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future. Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter. That's how it tricks you. The area under the curve is small, but its shape jabs into your consciousness like a pin.

区分重要事物的一种启发式方法是问问自己将来是否会关心它。重要的假货通常有一个看起来很重要的尖峰。它就是这样骗你的。曲线下的面积很小，但它的形状像针一样刺入你的意识。

The things that matter aren't necessarily the ones people would call "important." Having coffee with a friend matters. You won't feel later like that was a waste of time.

重要的事情不一定是人们所说的“重要”的事情。和朋友喝咖啡很重要。你以后不会觉得那是浪费时间。

One great thing about having small children is that they make you spend time on things that matter: them. They grab your sleeve as you're staring at your phone and say "will you play with me?" And odds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option.

生小孩的一大好处是他们会让你把时间花在重要的事情上：他们。当你盯着你的手机时，他们抓住你的袖子说“你愿意和我一起玩吗？”很有可能这实际上是废话最小化的选择。

If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by surprise. And that is just what tends to happen. You take things for granted, and then they're gone. You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. The saddest windows close when other people die. Their lives are short too. After my mother died, I wished I'd spent more time with her. I lived as if she'd always be there. And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion. But an illusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I did.

如果生命短暂，我们应该预料到它的短暂会让我们措手不及。这就是往往会发生的事情。你认为事情是理所当然的，然后它们就消失了。你认为你总能写那本书，或者爬那座山，或者其他什么，然后你意识到窗户已经关闭了。当其他人死去时，最悲伤的窗户就会关闭。他们的生命也很短暂。我母亲去世后，我希望我能花更多的时间陪她。我的生活就像她永远在那里一样。她以她典型的安静方式鼓励了这种幻想。但这是一种幻觉。我想很多人都犯了和我一样的错误。

The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to be consciously aware of it. Back when life was more precarious, people used to be aware of death to a degree that would now seem a bit morbid. I'm not sure why, but it doesn't seem the right answer to be constantly reminding oneself of the grim reaper hovering at everyone's shoulder. Perhaps a better solution is to look at the problem from the other end. Cultivate a habit of impatience about the things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother. You don't need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait. Just don't wait.

避免被某事吓到的通常方法是有意识地意识到它。在生活更加不稳定的时候，人们曾经对死亡的意识达到现在看起来有点病态的程度。我不确定为什么，但不断提醒自己每个人的肩膀上都盘旋着死神似乎不是正确的答案。也许更好的解决办法是从另一端看问题。养成对最想做的事情不耐烦的习惯。不要等到爬完那座山、写那本书或去看望你的母亲。你不需要不断地提醒自己为什么不应该等待。别等了。

I can think of two more things one does when one doesn't have much of something: try to get more of it, and savor what one has. Both make sense here.

当一个人没有太多东西时，我可以想到另外两件事：尝试获得更多，并品尝一个人拥有的东西。两者在这里都有意义。

How you live affects how long you live. Most people could do better. Me among them.

你的生活方式会影响你的寿命。大多数人可以做得更好。我在他们中间。

But you can probably get even more effect by paying closer attention to the time you have. It's easy to let the days rush by. The "flow" that imaginative people love so much has a darker cousin that prevents you from pausing to savor life amid the daily slurry of errands and alarms. One of the most striking things I've read was not in a book, but the title of one: James Salter's _Burning the Days_.

但是，如果您更密切地关注自己拥有的时间，您可能会获得更大的效果。让日子匆匆而过很容易。富有想象力的人如此喜爱的“流动”有一个更黑暗的表亲，它会阻止你在日常的差事和警报中停下来细细品味生活。我读过的最引人注目的东西之一不是在一本书中，而是在其中一本书的标题中：詹姆斯·索尔特 (James Salter) 的《燃烧的日子》。

It is possible to slow time somewhat. I've gotten better at it. Kids help. When you have small children, there are a lot of moments so perfect that you can't help noticing.

可以稍微减慢时间。我已经做得更好了。孩子们帮忙。当您有小孩时，有很多时刻如此完美，您会情不自禁地注意到。

It does help too to feel that you've squeezed everything out of some experience. The reason I'm sad about my mother is not just that I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have done that we didn't. My oldest son will be 7 soon. And while I miss the 3 year old version of him, I at least don't have any regrets over what might have been. We had the best time a daddy and a 3 year old ever had.

感觉你已经从一些经验中榨取了一切，这也确实有帮助。我为我母亲难过的原因不仅仅是因为我想念她，还因为我想到了所有我们本可以做却没有做的事情。我的大儿子马上就要 7 岁了。虽然我怀念他 3 岁时的样子，但至少我对可能发生的事情没有任何遗憾。我们度过了一个父亲和一个 3 岁孩子最美好的时光。

Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when life is short.

无情地修剪废话，不要等待做重要的事情，享受你拥有的时间。这就是你在生命短暂时所做的事情。

**Notes 笔记**

\[

1\] At first I didn't like it that the word that came to mind was one that had other meanings. But then I realized the other meanings are fairly closely related. Bullshit in the sense of things you waste your time on is a lot like intellectual bullshit.

\[1\] 起初我不喜欢它，因为我想到的这个词有其他含义。但后来我意识到其他含义是密切相关的。从你浪费时间的事情的意义上说，胡说八道很像智力上的胡说八道。

\[

2\] I chose this example deliberately as a note to self. I get attacked a lot online. People tell the craziest lies about me. And I have so far done a pretty mediocre job of suppressing the natural human inclination to say "Hey, that's not true!"

\[2\] 我特意选择了这个例子作为对自己的注释。我在网上经常受到攻击。人们对我说最疯狂的谎言。到目前为止，我在抑制人类说“嘿，那不是真的！”的自然倾向方面做得相当平庸。
