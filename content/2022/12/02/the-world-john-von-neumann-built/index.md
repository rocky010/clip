## Fortress of Logic

## 逻辑堡垒

## How the game theory of John von Neumann transformed the 20th century.

Unlike his much more famous colleague Albert Einstein, John von Neumann is not a household name these days, but his discoveries shape the possibilities of life for every creature on this planet. As a teenager, von Neumann provided mathematics with new foundations. He later helped teach the world how to build and detonate nuclear bombs. His invention of game theory furnished the conceptual tools with which superpowers today decide whether to wage war, economists model the behavior of markets, and biologists predict the evolution of viruses. The pioneering programmable computer that von Neumann and his employer, the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., completed in 1951 established “von Neumann architecture” as the standard for computer design well into the 21st century, making first IBM and then many other corporations fabulously wealthy.

。 与他更为著名的同事阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦不同，约翰·冯·诺依曼如今并不是家喻户晓的名字，但他的发现塑造了这个星球上每一种生物的生命可能性 十几岁的时候，冯诺依曼为数学奠定了新的基础。 后来，他帮助教世界如何制造和引爆核弹。 他发明的博弈论提供了当今超级大国决定是否发动战争、经济学家模拟市场行为以及生物学家预测病毒进化的概念工具。 冯诺依曼及其雇主新泽西州普林斯顿高等研究院于 1951 年完成的开创性可编程计算机将“冯诺依曼体系结构”确立为计算机设计标准，直至 21 世纪，首先是 IBM，然后是许多其他公司非常富有。

Von Neumann was not only a wildly insightful scientist; he was also prescient about the threats that some of his discoveries posed to the planet. “What we are creating now,” he said to his wife Klári after returning home from bomb work at Los Alamos in the spring of 1945, “is a monster whose influence is going to change history, provided there is any history left.” He then changed the subject to the computing machines of the future and became even more agitated, foreseeing disaster if “people \[could not\] keep pace with what they create.” Klári gave him some sleeping pills and a strong drink to calm him down, but von Neumann’s fears did not go away. “Can We Survive Technology?” was the question that he asked the readers of _Fortune_ magazine in 1955, predicting (among other things) “forms of climatic warfare as yet unimagined.”

冯诺依曼不仅是一位极富洞察力的科学家； 他对他的一些发现对地球构成的威胁也有先见之明。 “我们现在正在创造的，”他在 1945 年春天从洛斯阿拉莫斯的炸弹工作回家后对他的妻子 Klári 说，“是一个怪物，它的影响将改变历史，只要历史还存在。” 然后，他将话题转到了未来的计算机器上，并且变得更加激动，他预见到如果“人们\[无法\]跟上他们创造的东西的步伐”就会发生灾难。 克拉里给了他一些安眠药和一杯烈酒让他平静下来，但冯诺依曼的恐惧并没有消失。 “我们能在技术中生存吗？” 杂志的读者提出的问题 _这是他在 1955 年向《财富》_ ，预测（除其他外）“气候战争的形式至今仍无法想象。”

_The Man From the Future_, Ananyo Bhattacharya’s new biography, attends to von Neumann the scientist and von Neumann the prophet, and to many other von Neumanns as well: husband, father, friend, and colleague. From his birth in Budapest in 1903 to his death in Washington, D.C., at the age of 53, the book offers us a striking portrait of a man who contributed as much to the technological transformation of the world as any other scientist of the 20th century. Along the way, _The Man From the Future_ also explains the science and why that science still matters.

_来自未来的人_ ，Ananyo Bhattacharya 的新传记，关注科学家冯·诺依曼和先知冯·诺依曼，以及其他许多冯·诺依曼：丈夫、父亲、朋友和同事。 从他 1903 年在布达佩斯出生到他在华盛顿特区去世，享年 53 岁，这本书为我们描绘了一个与 20 世纪任何其他科学家一样对世界技术变革做出巨大贡献的人的惊人写照. 一路上， _来自未来的人_ 也解释了科学以及为什么科学仍然重要。

Popular scientific biography is a difficult genre, because its heroes often speak a language that is hard for mere mortals to understand. Some of von Neumann’s colleagues joked that he was “descended from a superior species but had made a detailed study of human beings so he could imitate them perfectly.” In fact, not only von Neumann but a whole group of extraordinary Hungarian Jewish scientists who emigrated to the United States during the war were sometimes referred to as “the Martians,” on account of their extraordinary abilities (and thick accents). Bhattacharya proves to be a skilled translator from “Martian” to human. His descriptions of the scientific questions are always engaging and generally illuminating—a real achievement, especially given the variety of topics that intrigued von Neumann. The book carries us from field to field, from set theory and the logical foundations of mathematics at the beginning of his career, through the quantum revolution in physics and the computing revolution in calculation, to game theory and its implications for strategists (think _Dr. Strangelove_) and economists (think _A Beautiful Mind_), to the influence of von Neumann’s late work in fields like neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and theories of self-replicating systems (whether genes or machines).

通俗科学传记是一种困难的体裁，因为它的主人公经常说一种普通人难以理解的语言。 冯·诺依曼的一些同事开玩笑说，他“是高级物种的后裔，但对人类进行了详细研究，因此他可以完美地模仿他们。” 事实上，不仅是冯诺依曼，还有一整群在战争期间移民到美国的非凡的匈牙利犹太科学家，有时也被称为“火星人”，因为他们非凡的能力（和浓重的口音）。 Bhattacharya 被证明是一位熟练的从“火星人”到人类的翻译者。 他对科学问题的描述总是引人入胜，总体上很有启发性——这是一项真正的成就，尤其是考虑到冯·诺依曼感兴趣的主题多种多样。 这本书带领我们从一个领域到另一个领域，从他职业生涯开始时的集合论和数学逻辑基础，到物理学中的量子革命和计算中的计算革命，再到博弈论及其对战略家的影响（想想 _Strangelove 博士_ ）和经济学家（想想 _美丽心灵_ ），以及冯诺依曼后期在神经科学、进化生物学和自我复制系统（无论是基因还是机器）理论等领域的工作的影响。

The tour is as rapid as the questing mind of its subject—imagine traveling to Kruger National Park, the Taj Mahal, Easter Island, and the Dome of the Rock all in one week—and every stop is fascinating, though some of the scientific subjects, unsurprisingly, are better covered than others. Through it all, there runs a simple and elegant explanation of von Neumann’s greatest strength: In the words of the mathematical physicist Freeman Dyson, who overlapped briefly with von Neumann at the Institute for Advanced Study and was in some ways his successor, “Johnny’s unique gift as a mathematician was to transform problems in all areas of mathematics into problems of logic.”

旅行的速度与其主题的探索精神一样快——想象一下在一周内前往克鲁格国家公园、泰姬陵、复活节岛和圆顶清真寺——每一站都令人着迷，尽管一些科学主题, 毫不奇怪，比其他人覆盖得更好。 自始至终，对冯诺依曼的最大优势有一个简单而优雅的解释：用数学物理学家弗里曼戴森的话来说，他在高等研究院与冯诺依曼有过短暂的重叠，在某些方面是他的继任者，“约翰尼独特的作为数学家的天赋是将数学所有领域的问题转化为逻辑问题。”

Mathematics was not the only field to which von Neumann applied that gift. In fact, he transformed nearly all of the problems that interested him throughout his life into problems of logic. To put it in his own words, chosen by Bhattacharya as the book’s epigraph: “If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.” Over and over again, from his early paper establishing a new approach to mathematics’s foundations by building on the axioms of logic and the concept of the “empty set” to his later contributions to economics and the social sciences, von Neumann proceeded by reducing problems of intractable complexity to ones of logical simplicity. Bhattacharya suggests that this was true even of his child custody arrangements, citing Marina von Neumann Whitman, whose fascinating autobiography _The Martian’s Daughter_ speaks of her father’s “lifelong desire to impose order and rationality on an inherently disorderly and irrational world.”

数学并不是冯·诺依曼应用这种天赋的唯一领域。 事实上，他几乎将一生感兴趣的所有问题都转化为逻辑问题。 用他自己的话来说，被 Bhattacharya 选择作为这本书的题词：“如果人们不相信数学是简单的，那只是因为他们没有意识到生活是多么复杂。” 一次又一次，从他早期的论文通过建立逻辑公理和“空集”的概念来建立数学基础的新方法到他后来对经济学和社会科学的贡献，冯诺依曼通过减少问题难以处理的复杂性与逻辑上的简单性。 Bhattacharya 表示，即使是他的孩子监护权安排也是如此，引用 Marina von Neumann Whitman 的话，她的引人入胜的自传 _火星人的女儿_ 谈到她父亲“终生渴望将秩序和理性强加给一个天生无序和非理性的世界”。

That lifelong desire emerged early. János (von Neumann’s Hungarian name) was born into a Jewish family that had become prosperous by pioneering catalog sales of hardware and farm machinery. His father, Max, a doctor of law turned banker, “believed in the life of the mind,” as John’s brother Nicholas put it, and insisted that his children learn ancient Greek and Latin as well as French, Italian, and English. János mastered all of these (on his deathbed he could still recall large portions of Thucydides’s _History of the Peloponnesian War_ in the original Attic), but some abilities, such as multiplying two eight-digit numbers in his head when he was 6, astounded more than others. His prodigious mathematical talent was noted as soon as he started high school, and he was immediately sent, as a young teen, to the University of Budapest, where three top mathematicians undertook his education. Von Neumann was 17 when he published his first paper, and he was still 17 when he took on the challenge issued by the great David Hilbert, then the elder statesman of mathematics, to find a logical basis for the field that would be free of any possibility of paradox. “If mathematical thinking is defective,” Hilbert had asked, “where are we to find truth and certitude?” In 10 short pages, von Neumann set out to build a fortress of logic capable of defending mathematics, deploying set theory to articulate a new definition of ordinal and cardinal numbers that avoided the paradoxes and complexities that had plagued all earlier definitions. It remains the standard today.

那个 毕生的愿望很早就出现了。 János（冯·诺依曼的匈牙利名字）出生于一个犹太家庭，该家庭因开创性地销售硬件和农用机械而发家致富。 他的父亲马克斯是一名法学博士，后来成为银行家，“相信思想的生活”，正如约翰的兄弟尼古拉斯所说，并坚持让他的孩子学习古希腊语和拉丁语以及法语、意大利语和英语。 大部分内容 _János 掌握了所有这些（在他临终前，他仍然可以回忆起原版 Attic 中修昔底德 (Thucydides)的伯罗奔尼撒战争史的_ ），但是一些能力，例如他 6 岁时头脑中的两个八位数相乘，更令人震惊相对于其它的。 他惊人的数学天赋在他上高中时就被注意到了，十几岁的他立即被送到布达佩斯大学，在那里接受了三位顶尖数学家的教育。 冯诺依曼发表第一篇论文时只有 17 岁，当他接受伟大的大卫希尔伯特（当时的数学元老）提出的挑战时，他仍然只有 17 岁，他要为这个领域找到一个不受任何影响的逻辑基础。悖论的可能性。 “如果数学思维有缺陷，”希尔伯特曾问道，“我们到哪里去寻找真理和确定性？” 在短短的 10 页中，冯·诺依曼着手建立一个能够捍卫数学的逻辑堡垒，运用集合论阐明了序数和基数的新定义，避免了困扰所有早期定义的悖论和复杂性。 它今天仍然是标准。

Von Neumann’s doctoral dissertation in 1925 took on another foundational project: the systematization of all of set theory, a task he achieved with a single page of axioms from which vast palaces of mathematics could be built. A few years later, in 1928, he applied a similar approach to developing a theory of parlor games. In this early work of “pure mathematics,” one can already see the insights he would deploy decades later in creating an architecture for computing machines that could, on the basis of a minimal set of logical instructions, inputs, and outputs, carry out any conceivable set of computations. In his _Theory of Self-Reproducing Automata_ (published posthumously in 1966), von Neumann went even further, describing the conditions under which, with no more than eight parts (four structural and four dedicated to logical operations), complex creatures could emerge capable of executing any type of computation and even of replicating themselves. One of the glories of Bhattacharya’s book is that it makes abundantly clear how von Neumann’s early explorations into the deepest foundations of pure mathematics became the springboard for his contributions to so many other fields, from quantum physics to economics, from theories of computing to theories of biological life.

冯诺依曼 1925 年的博士论文承担了另一个基础项目：所有集合论的系统化，他用一页公理完成了一项任务，从中可以建造巨大的数学宫殿。 几年后，即 1928 年，他运用类似的方法发展了室内博弈理论。 在这项“纯数学”的早期著作中，人们已经可以看到他几十年后在创建计算机架构时所运用的见解，该架构可以在一组最小的逻辑指令、输入和输出的基础上执行任何操作可以想象的一组计算。 在他 _的自我复制自动机理论_ （于 1966 年死后出版）中，冯·诺依曼走得更远，描述了在不超过八个部分（四个结构部分和四个专门用于逻辑运算）的条件下，复杂的生物可以出现能够执行任何类型的计算，甚至复制自己。 Bhattacharya 的书的一大亮点在于，它非常清楚地说明了冯诺依曼早期对纯数学最深层基础的探索如何成为他对许多其他领域做出贡献的跳板，从量子物理学到经济学，从计算理论到计算理论生物生命。

Bhattacharya guides us through all of these discoveries and the uses to which they were put, providing us with a vivid sense of the impact this singular figure has had on scientific thought. Each of von Neumann’s insights is approached more or less the same way: as a cue ball shot into a waiting rack of brilliant minds, its force knocking them into insightful paths and fantastic pockets of discovery. This model of writing about science has the advantage of narrative clarity and power, but it has some shortcomings as well. One of these is that, by concentrating so heavily on the genius of individuals, it misses the important role that institutions—from schools and universities to corporations and national governments—play in making discovery possible.

Bhattacharya 带领我们了解了所有这些发现及其用途，让我们生动地感受到这个独特人物对科学思想的影响。 冯诺依曼的每一个见解都或多或少地以相同的方式接近：作为一个母球射入等待的聪明头脑，它的力量将他们推向有洞察力的路径和奇妙的发现口袋。 这种关于科学的写作模式具有叙述清晰和有力的优点，但也有一些缺点。 其中之一是，由于过于关注个人的天才，它忽略了机构——从学校和大学到公司和国家政府——在使发现成为可能方面发挥的重要作用。

It is indeed exciting to follow the extraordinarily energetic von Neumann from one intellectual encounter to another, seemingly propelled by chance meetings at train stations and courageous voyages across a war-torn Atlantic. But we should not forget that those encounters took place within the vast network created by two government agencies scarcely mentioned in the book: the National Defense Research Committee and its successor, the Office of Scientific Research and Development, which coordinated nearly all US research related to World War II and in the process initiated a new age in the history of science.

跟随精力充沛的冯·诺依曼从一次知识相遇到另一次相遇确实令人兴奋，这似乎是由火车站的偶然相遇和穿越饱受战争蹂躏的大西洋的勇敢航行所推动的。 但我们不应忘记，这些会面发生在书中几乎没有提及的两个政府机构创建的庞大网络中：国防研究委员会及其继任者科学研究与发展办公室，后者协调了几乎所有美国与国防相关的研究。第二次世界大战及其过程开启了科学史上的一个新时代。

Similarly, the institution that employed von Neumann (as well as Einstein, Kurt Gödel, and numerous others who people Bhattacharya’s pages) from 1933 until his death in 1957 appears in the book primarily in envious caricature (“the Institute for Advanced Salaries”) or as an obstacle to von Neumann’s more applied ambitions. But his creativity would have looked very different had he not found refuge in that particular institution, designed to attract the best minds from across the globe regardless of religion, gender, nationality, or race; to let them pursue their interests in whatever direction they wished; and to ensure that the results were made freely available to the world. The Institute for Advanced Study funded von Neumann’s computer. It insisted on what we today call “open access,” sending regular reports about its progress to hundreds of research centers in the United States and abroad, and it shared von Neumann’s commitment to not patenting the results. How different would the history of computing have looked if von Neumann’s programming architecture had been developed for the military, for a corporation, or for a university more intent on securing intellectual property rights than on promoting the free exchange of ideas? _Life_ magazine was being hyperbolic when, in 1947, it called the Institute for Advanced Study “one of the most important places on the earth.” But it was right in suggesting that research institutions and their values matter, given how much they shape our possibilities for learning, for discovery, and for the circulation of knowledge.

同样，从 1933 年到他 1957 年去世期间雇用冯·诺依曼（以及爱因斯坦、库尔特·哥德尔和许多其他在 Bhattacharya 页面上工作的人）的机构主要以令人羡慕的讽刺漫画（“高薪研究所”）或作为冯诺依曼更实用的野心的障碍。 但是，如果他没有在那个旨在吸引全球最优秀的人才而不论宗教、性别、国籍或种族的机构中找到庇护所，他的创造力看起来会大不相同； 让他们按照自己的意愿追求自己的兴趣； 并确保向全世界免费提供结果。 高等研究院资助了冯·诺依曼的计算机。 它坚持我们今天所说的“开放获取”，定期向美国和国外的数百个研究中心发送有关其进展的报告，并且它与冯诺依曼一样承诺不为结果申请专利。 如果冯·诺依曼的编程架构是为军队、公司或大学开发的，那么计算的历史将会有多么不同？更专注于保护知识产权而不是促进思想的自由交流？ _1947 年， 《生活_ 》杂志将高等研究院称为“地球上最重要的地方之一”，当时它是夸张的。 但考虑到研究机构及其价值观对我们学习、发现和知识传播的可能性有多大影响，它的建议是正确的。

Perhaps the most significant shortcoming of Bhattacharya’s approach is that his celebratory tone sometimes precludes serious critical engagement with the ways in which our world has been profoundly altered by the ideas he is writing about. This is most evident in his treatment of von Neumann’s pioneering work in the social sciences, the 1944 book _Theory of Games and Economic Behavior_, written in collaboration with the economist Oskar Morgenstern. Like von Neumann, Morgenstern was a product of the collapsing Austro-Hungarian Empire, although from its aristocratic rather than its Jewish corners (his mother may have been the illegitimate daughter of Emperor Friedrich III). As an economist, his quest was—to borrow the title of a paper he published in 1935—to achieve a science capable of “Perfect Foresight and Economic Equilibrium.” When Morgenstern presented that paper in Vienna, a mathematician in the audience suggested an article he thought might prove helpful: von Neumann’s “On the Theory of Parlor Games,” which outlined a set-theory approach to strategic choices in games like poker. As Morgenstern read the article, he began to wonder: Could theories of strategic choice by players in a game be extended to the choices of agents in an economy? Morgenstern started “to read a lot of logic and set-theory” and to write papers with titles like “Logic and the Social Sciences.” But it was only after he’d emigrated to the United States in 1938 that he received what he called “a gift from heaven,” namely a meeting with von Neumann.

也许Bhattacharya 的方法最显着的缺点是，他的庆祝语气有时会妨碍认真批判地参与我们的世界被他所写的想法所深刻改变的方式。 这在他对冯·诺依曼在社会科学领域的开创性工作的处理中最为明显，该著作是 1944 年 _的《博弈论与经济行为_ 与经济学家奥斯卡·摩根斯坦合作撰写 》一书。 和冯·诺依曼一样，摩根斯坦是崩溃的奥匈帝国的产物，尽管来自贵族而不是犹太人（他的母亲可能是弗里德里希三世皇帝的私生女）。 作为一名经济学家，他的追求是——借用他在 1935 年发表的一篇论文的标题——实现一门能够“完美预见和经济均衡”的科学。 当 Morgenstern 在维也纳展示那篇论文时，听众中的一位数学家推荐了一篇他认为可能有用的文章：冯·诺伊曼 (von Neumann) 的“On the Theory of Parlor Games”，其中概述了扑克等游戏中战略选择的集合论方法。 当摩根斯坦读到这篇文章时，他开始思考：玩家在博弈中的战略选择理论能否扩展到经济体中代理人的选择？ 摩根斯坦开始“阅读大量逻辑和集合论”，并撰写标题为“逻辑与社会科学”的论文。 但直到 1938 年他移居美国后，他才收到了他所谓的“来自天堂的礼物”，即与冯诺依曼的会面。

Thus began the collaboration that produced _Theory of Games and Economic Behavior_. The coauthors state their goal plainly: “We hope to establish satisfactorily…that the typical problems of economic behavior become strictly identical with the mathematical notions of suitable games of strategy.” Before reading further, let’s pause to make sure we understand the massive implications of this claim. If you assume that the behavior of economies is built out of the desires and choices of individuals, then establishing “strict identity” means demonstrating that “the motives of the individual”—that is to say, basic aspects of human psychology—are entirely reducible to “mathematical notions.” This reduction is what von Neumann and Morgenstern set out to provide.

从而开始了产生 _博弈论和经济行为_ 的合作。 合著者明确地陈述了他们的目标：“我们希望令人满意地建立……经济行为的典型问题与适当的策略游戏的数学概念严格相同。” 在进一步阅读之前，让我们暂停一下以确保我们理解这一说法的巨大影响。 如果你假设经济行为是建立在个人的欲望和选择之上的，那么建立“严格身份”就意味着证明“个人的动机”——也就是说，人类心理的基本方面——是完全可以还原的到“数学概念”。 这种减少是冯诺依曼和摩根斯坦打算提供的。

Invoking the example of physics, they begin by creating a radically simplified model, an economy of just one isolated individual who, following Marx and other earlier economists, they named after Robinson Crusoe, the shipwrecked sailor of Daniel Defoe’s famous novel. They then describe the axioms, the “assumptions which have to be made” in their model, about “the behavior of the individual, and the simplest forms of exchange.” Here are some of those assumptions: First, the individual seeks to “obtain a maximum of utility or satisfaction” of various desires and wants within the given constraints. How do we know that the maximization of utility is a universal law of human nature? No reason is given. Next assumption: “Utility or satisfaction” must be quantifiable or at least rankable; otherwise it could not be maximized. But why should we think that desires are quantifiable or rankable, either by human agents or by the economists studying them? The axiom is not forced upon us by our psychological experience or empirical observation. It is necessary so that economics can become a mathematical science, much as in physics time needs to be thought of as the real number line, not because this corresponds to your sense of time (or Einstein’s, or Marcel Proust’s), but because it makes important aspects of modern physics mathematically tractable.

他们援引物理学的例子，首先创建了一个彻底简化的模型，一个只有一个孤立个体的经济，这个个体效仿马克思和其他早期经济学家，以丹尼尔·笛福著名小说中遇难的水手鲁滨逊·克鲁索的名字命名。 然后他们描述了公理，即他们模型中“必须做出的假设”，关于“个人的行为和最简单的交换形式”。 以下是其中的一些假设：首先，个人寻求在给定的限制条件下“获得最大的效用或满足”的各种欲望和需求。 怎么知道效用最大化是人性的普遍规律呢？ 没有给出任何理由。 下一个假设：“效用或满意度”必须是可量化的或至少是可排名的； 否则无法最大化。 但是，为什么我们认为欲望是可量化的或可排序的，无论是通过人类代理人还是通过研究它们的经济学家？ 这个公理不是由我们的心理经验或经验观察强加给我们的。 这是必要的，这样经济学才能成为一门数学科学，就像在物理学中，时间需要被认为是实数线，不是因为这符合你的时间感（或爱因斯坦的，或马塞尔普鲁斯特的），而是因为它使现代物理学的重要方面在数学上易于处理。

To give you a flavor of the argument, let me put yet another assumption in the more formal terms favored by von Neumann and Morgenstern: Given any two objects of desire (_u_ and _v_), the subject can always say which one she prefers, or else that she has no preference. And what of cases where there are more than two options on the table, as there so often are? For any three or more commodities, objects, or imagined events—call them _a_, _b_, _c_, and so on—all rational agents who prefer _a_ to _b_ and _b_ to _c_ will also prefer _a_ to _c_. This assumption is called the “transitivity of preference,” axiom 3:A:b in _Theory of Games and Economic Behavior_. The meager justification: “Transitivity of preference \[is\] a plausible and generally accepted property.” With this axiom about humanity in hand, von Neumann and Morgenstern proclaim that “a primarily psychological group of phenomena has been axiomatized.”

为了让你对这个论点有所了解，让我用冯·诺依曼和摩根斯坦喜欢的更正式的术语提出另一个假设：给定任何两个欲望对象（ _u_ 和 _v_ ），主体总是可以说出她更喜欢哪个，或者否则她没有偏好。 如果桌面上有两个以上的选项，那么情况又会怎样呢？ 对于任何三种或更多商品、物品或想象的事件——称它们 _为 a_ 、 _b_ 、 _c_ 等等——所有偏好 _a_ 胜过 _b_ 和 _b_ 胜过 _c_ 的理性主体也会偏好 _a_ 胜过 _c_ 。 这个假设被称为“偏好的传递性”，公理 3:A:b 在 _博弈论和经济行为_ 中。 微不足道的理由：“偏好的传递性 \[是\] 一个看似合理且普遍接受的属性。” 有了这条关于人性的公理，冯·诺依曼和摩根斯坦宣称“一组主要是心理现象已经被公理化了”。

Bhattacharya agrees. He offers a clear and accessible description of _Theory of Games and Economic Behavior_, avoiding formalism and using examples like the choice between watching TV or ordering take-out in order to narrate how “von Neumann quickly invented a revolutionary theory that allowed an individual’s likes and dislikes to be assigned a number on a ‘happiness’ or utility scale, just as a thermometer reading gives the temperature of a bowl of soup.” But can human happiness be measured like a bowl of soup’s temperature? Bhattacharya appears to endorse this view, moving from description to celebration without once passing through criticism: “Von Neumann,” he writes, “had achieved the supposedly impossible—a rigorous way to assign numbers to nebulous human desires and predilections.”

Bhattacharya 同意。 了清晰易懂的描述 _他对博弈论和经济行为进行_ ，避免了形式主义，并使用了诸如在看电视或订购外卖之间进行选择的例子来讲述“冯·诺依曼如何迅速发明了一种革命性的理论，允许个人的喜好和不喜欢在‘幸福’或效用等级上被分配一个数字，就像温度计读数给出一碗汤的温度一样。” 但是，人类的幸福能像一碗汤的温度那样衡量吗？ Bhattacharya 似乎赞同这一观点，从描述到庆祝都没有经过批评：“冯·诺依曼，”他写道，“已经实现了所谓的不可能——一种将数字分配给模糊的人类欲望和偏好的严格方法。”

Yet in making questions of human desire strictly identical to numbers, Bhattacharya, like von Neumann, has forgotten a basic truth about the relationship of logic to the complexity of life. In the words of an earlier logician and philosopher of astounding talent, Charles Sanders Peirce:

。 然而，在将人类欲望的问题严格等同于数字时，Bhattacharya 和冯诺依曼一样，忘记了逻辑与生活复杂性之间关系的基本真理 用早期一位才华横溢的逻辑学家和哲学家查尔斯·桑德斯·皮尔士的话来说：

> An engineer, or a business company…or a physicist, finds it suits his purpose to ascertain what the necessary consequences of possible facts would be; but the facts are so complicated that he cannot deal with them in his usual way. He calls upon a mathematician and states the question…. It frequently happens that the facts, as stated, are insufficient to answer the question that is put. Accordingly, the first business of the mathematician, often a most difficult task, is to frame another simpler but quite fictitious problem…which shall be within his powers, while at the same time it is sufficiently like the problem set before him to answer, well or ill, as a substitute for it.
> 
> 一位工程师、一家商业公司……或一位物理学家发现确定可能事实的必然后果是什么符合他的目的； 但事实如此复杂，他无法以他通常的方式处理它们。 他拜访了一位数学家并提出了问题……。 经常发生的情况是，如前所述，事实不足以回答所提出的问题。 因此，数学家的首要任务，通常是最困难的任务，是构建另一个更简单但相当虚构的问题……这应该在他的能力范围内，同时它与摆在他面前的问题足够相似，可以回答，好吧或生病，作为它的替代品。

Every mathematical rendering of objects that are not purely mathematical is a simplification, an “as if,” and that “as if” should always come with a caution. When you produce or encounter such a logical simplification, do not forget to ask: How “sufficiently like” is the similitude to the object of study? And how do I decide whether the difference is for good or ill? A great deal hinges on the answers to those questions, not least when the simplification on offer is of the human psyche.

每一个非纯数学对象的数学渲染都是一种简化，一种“好像”，而“好像”应该始终谨慎。 当你产生或遇到这样的逻辑简化时，不要忘记问：与研究对象的相似度有多“足够相似”？ 我如何确定差异是好是坏？ 很大程度上取决于这些问题的答案，尤其是当所提供的简化是针对人类心理的时候。

Rather than ask these questions, however, Bhattacharya moves on to explore some of the more extreme applications of game theory, such as “gaming nuclear war.” This chapter is important: Bhattacharya’s explanations of the role of the RAND Corporation in strategic modeling, of John Nash’s generalization of the theory to noncooperative conflicts and _n_\-person games, and of the emergence of gamelike models for cooperation and conflict such as the “Prisoner’s Dilemma,” all help us to understand how game theory became and continues to be a key decision-making tool of military strategy and international relations. But the more basic questions are never asked: Can a strict identity between human psychology and mathematical notions be established? And what is at stake in the answer?

然而，Bhattacharya 并没有问这些问题，而是继续探索博弈论的一些更极端的应用，例如“博弈核战争”。 本章很重要：Bhattacharya 对兰德公司在战略建模中的作用的解释，John Nash 将该理论推广到非合作冲突和 _n_ 人博弈，以及类似游戏的合作和冲突模型的出现，例如“囚徒的困境，”所有这些都有助于我们理解博弈论如何成为并将继续成为军事战略和国际关系的关键决策工具。 但更基本的问题从未被问及：能否在人类心理学和数学概念之间建立严格的同一性？ 答案的关键是什么？

No biography can do everything, so let us imagine what a more critical engagement with the _Theory of Games_ would look like. One might notice, for example, that unlike the case in physics, von Neumann and Morgenstern’s goal of “prediction by theory” in economics remains almost as far out of reach today as it was when the book was written some 70 years ago. Or one might ask whether their transitive and axiomatized man rings truer to our experience than the novel from which they drew his name, Defoe’s _Robinson Crusoe_, published in 1719. From beginning to end, that book’s eponymous hero is presented as a weather vane, unable to order, maintain, or even recognize his preferences. Years of shipwrecked self-reflection on his desert island do not erase the fluctuating nature of Crusoe’s desires and aversions, as here, near the end of the novel:

更批判性的 _没有传记可以包罗万象，所以让我们想象一下，对博弈论进行_ 研究会是什么样子。 例如，人们可能会注意到，与物理学的情况不同，冯·诺依曼和摩根斯坦在经济学中“通过理论进行预测”的目标在今天几乎与大约 70 年前写这本书时一样遥不可及。 或者有人可能会问，他们的可传递的和公理化的人是否比他们以他的名字命名的小说更符合我们的经验，即笛福 _的鲁滨逊漂流记_ 于 1719 年出版 。来命令、维护甚至识别他的偏好。 多年在他的荒岛上遭遇海难的自我反省并没有抹去鲁滨逊欲望和厌恶的波动本质，就像小说接近尾声的地方一样：

> From this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it was possible for me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary condition than it was probable I should ever have been in any other particular state in the world; and with this thought I was going to give thanks to God for bringing me to this place. I know not what it was, but something shocked my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words. “How canst thou become such a hypocrite,” said I, even audibly, “to pretend to be thankful for a condition which, however thou mayest endeavour to be contented with, thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered from?”
> 
> 从这一刻起，我开始在脑海中得出结论，在这种被遗弃的孤独状态下，我可能比世界上任何其他特定状态下的我都更快乐； 有了这个想法，我要感谢上帝把我带到这个地方。 我不知道那是什么，但那个想法让我震惊，我不敢说出这些话。 “你怎么能变成这样一个伪君子，”我甚至大声说，“假装对这样一种情况表示感谢，无论你如何努力满足，你宁愿衷心祈祷摆脱这种情况？”

Speaking for myself, this moment feels familiar: a moment in which one becomes aware of the inadequacy, inconstancy, contradiction, and even self-deception of one’s most intimate desires and convictions of happiness. Such conflicts within the self are often the very subject of literature and biography. Which is simply to say that in addition to explaining and even celebrating the powers of von Neumann’s logic, _The Man From the Future_ might also have pointed out that in many important aspects of his thoughts and desires, Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe is not von Neumann’s axiomatized man, and neither are we.

对我自己来说，这一刻感觉很熟悉：一个人开始意识到自己最私密的幸福愿望和信念的不足、反复无常、矛盾甚至自欺欺人的时刻。 自我内部的这种冲突往往是文学和传记的主题。 简单地说，除了解释甚至颂扬冯诺依曼逻辑的力量外， _《来自未来的人》_ 还可能指出，在他思想和愿望的许多重要方面，笛福的鲁滨逊漂流记并不是冯诺依曼公理化的人，我们也不是。

To understand why this is so important to remember, we need only return to the problem that so agitated von Neumann in 1945 as he considered the future of the technologies he was unleashing: “It would be unethical for the scientist not to do what they know is feasible,” he declared, “no matter what terrible consequences it may have.” So how could “people keep pace with what they create” in order to avoid those terrible consequences? Von Neumann returned to that question in his 1955 _Fortune_ essay “Can We Survive Technology?,” in which he asserted that changes in weaponry, communications, and climate meant that the world needed new political forms and ideals if it wished to avoid catastrophe.

要理解为什么记住这一点如此重要，我们只需要回到 1945 年冯诺依 曼在考虑他所释放的技术的未来时如此激动的问题：“科学家不做他们认为的事情是不道德的知道是可行的，”他宣称，“不管它可能产生多么可怕的后果。” 那么，“人们如何与他们创造的东西保持同步”才能避免那些可怕的后果呢？ 》杂志的文章“我们能在技术中生存吗？”中回到了这个问题，他在 _冯·诺依曼在他 1955 年发表于《财富_ 文中断言，武器、通信和气候的变化意味着如果世界希望避免灾难，就需要新的政治形式和理想。

The only recipe for surviving technological change, von Neumann concluded, was relying on “human qualities.” But what are those qualities? What is “human” about them? And how can they help us achieve the political forms and ideals necessary to ensure our survival? Von Neumann and his powers of logic did not address those questions. On the contrary, he encouraged us to imagine a strict identity between mathematics and the human, and he gave us the tools to extend one particular kind of human activity—games of strategy—into ever-greater domains of life. Today, game theory and its computational algorithms govern not only our nuclear strategy but also many parts of our working world (Uber, Lyft, and many others), our social lives (Meta, TikTok) and love affairs (Tinder), our access to information (Google), and even our sense of play. Von Neumann’s ideas about human psychology provided the founding charter for the algorithmic “gamification” of the world as we know it. By concealing the distance between logic and the complexity of being rather than minding the gap, his axiomatized “psychology” heightened the very dangers he feared.

冯·诺依曼总结道，要在技术变革中幸存下来，唯一的秘诀就是依靠“人的素质”。 但这些品质是什么？ 他们的“人”是什么？ 它们如何帮助我们实现确保我们生存所必需的政治形式和理想？ 冯诺依曼和他的逻辑能力并没有解决这些问题。 相反，他鼓励我们想象数学与人类之间存在严格的同一性，并且他为我们提供了将一种特殊的人类活动（策略游戏）扩展到更广泛的生活领域的工具。 今天，博弈论及其计算算法不仅支配着我们的核心战略，而且支配着我们工作世界的许多部分（Uber、Lyft 和许多其他）、我们的社交生活（Meta、TikTok）和爱情事务（Tinder）、我们对信息（谷歌），甚至我们的游戏意识。 冯诺依曼关于人类心理学的思想为我们所知的世界的算法“游戏化”提供了基础章程。 通过隐藏逻辑与存在的复杂性之间的距离而不是介意这种差距，他公理化的“心理学”加剧了他所担心的危险。

What does minding the gap look like? The first step is simply to notice that there is one, as J. Robert Oppenheimer did in 1960, a few years after von Neumann’s death. “What are we to make of a civilization,” he asked, “which has always regarded ethics as an essential part of human life, and…which has not been able to talk about the prospect of killing almost everybody, except in prudential and game-theoretical terms?” Oppenheimer had collaborated with von Neumann for many years, first leading the Manhattan Project, which produced the atom bomb, and then as director of the Institute for Advanced Study. This did not prevent him from realizing the dangers of reducing the human to a series of axioms, or from despairing—like Cassandra—of the possibility of making his warnings heard.

注意差距是什么样子的？ 第一步就是注意到有一个，正如 J. 罗伯特奥本海默在 1960 年冯诺依曼去世几年后所做的那样。 “我们如何看待一个文明，”他问道，“它一直将道德视为人类生活的重要组成部分，并且......它一直无法谈论杀死几乎所有人的前景，除了谨慎和游戏之外-理论术语？ 奥本海默与冯诺依曼合作多年，先是领导制造原子弹的曼哈顿计划，然后担任高级研究所所长。 这并没有阻止他意识到将人类简化为一系列公理的危险，也没有阻止他像卡桑德拉一样对发出警告的可能性感到绝望。

I suspect that both von Neumann and Bhattacharya would agree that we need logic and technology, but that we also need a better understanding of the human if we are to survive. If the human is not entirely reducible to logic or algorithm, then that understanding cannot come from mathematics and technology alone. What quests for knowledge can produce it? What kinds of inquiries, collaborations, and research institutions are necessary if humanity is to “keep pace”? _The Man From the Future_ does not ask these questions, but it may provoke others to do so.

我怀疑 von Neumann 和 Bhattacharya 都会同意我们需要逻辑和技术，但如果我们要生存，我们还需要更好地理解人类。 如果人类不能完全还原为逻辑或算法，那么这种理解就不能仅来自数学和技术。 什么样的知识追求可以产生它？ 如果人类要“跟上步伐”，需要什么样的调查、合作和研究机构？ _来自未来的_ 人不会问这些问题，但可能会激起其他人这样做。

I write these pages in the director’s office at the Institute for Advanced Study, where von Neumann spent the bulk of his career. I am sitting at a desk that once belonged to Oppenheimer, who served as director from 1947 to 1966. The office itself hasn’t changed much since Oppenheimer and von Neumann’s day, though since I am a historian and not a mathematician or a physicist, I have added more bookshelves to supplement the blackboard favored by my predecessors. Perhaps there is a metaphor in the furniture, one capable of generating the “human qualities” that von Neumann thought so critical if we are to “survive technology.” We need the bookshelves to interact with the blackboard. We need to engage the Robinson Crusoe of von Neumann and Morgenstern’s economics with the Robinson Crusoe of Defoe’s novel; Oppenheimer’s “ethics” with game theory’s algorithms; the drive toward logic and axiom with a recognition of those parts of the human psyche that cannot be reduced to noncontradiction or strict identity. We need institutions capable of generating such engagements between the different ways of discovering the human, and we need disciplines open to such interactions. Bhattacharya’s book serves to remind us that this fundamental need is as urgent today as it has ever been.

我在高级研究所所长办公室里写下这些页面，冯诺依曼在那里度过了他职业生涯的大部分时间。 我坐在一张曾经属于奥本海默的办公桌前，奥本海默在 1947 年至 1966 年间担任主任。自奥本海默和冯诺依曼时代以来，办公室本身并没有太大变化，但由于我是一名历史学家，而不是数学家或物理学家，我增加了更多的书架来补充前辈们喜欢的黑板。 也许家具中有一个隐喻，一个能够产生冯诺依曼认为如果我们要“在技术中生存”至关重要的“人类品质”。 我们需要书架来与黑板互动。 我们需要将冯·诺依曼和摩根斯坦经济学的鲁滨逊漂流记与笛福小说中的鲁滨逊漂流记联系起来； 奥本海默的“伦理学”与博弈论的算法； 对逻辑和公理的推动，承认人类心理的那些部分不能被简化为非矛盾或严格的同一性。 我们需要能够在发现人类的不同方式之间产生这种参与的机构，我们需要对这种互动开放的学科。 Bhattacharya 的书提醒我们，这一基本需求在今天和以往一样紧迫。
