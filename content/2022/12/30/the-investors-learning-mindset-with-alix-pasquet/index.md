I recently had the great pleasure of recording a talk with my friend Alix Pasquet III. Alix is the Managing Partner and portfolio manager at hedge fund Prime Macaya and has been a friend and teacher to me for years. He is one of my favorite sources of ideas and book recommendations.

我最近非常高兴地录制了与我的朋友 Alix Pasquet III 的谈话。 Alix 是对冲基金 Prime Macaya 的管理合伙人和投资组合经理，多年来一直是我的朋友和老师。他是我最喜欢的思想来源和书籍推荐之一。

In this presentation titled _Learning for Analysts and Future Portfolio Managers_ Alix shared his framework for becoming a learning machine. Despite the title, many of the concepts apply to life and business more generally.

在这篇题为分析师和未来投资组合经理学习的演讲中，Alix 分享了他成为学习机器的框架。尽管有标题，但许多概念更普遍地适用于生活和商业。

The talk contains three sections: problems, mindsets, and conditions, procedures, and action steps.

演讲包含三个部分：问题、心态和条件、程序和行动步骤。

_Problems_ deals with unique issues facing investment analysts.  
问题处理投资分析师面临的独特问题。  

_Mindset_ tackles meta ideas about learning, including Alix’s emphasis that “learning is behavioral change.”

Mindset 处理关于学习的元观点，包括 Alix 强调的“学习是行为改变”。

> “If your behavior hasn't changed, you haven't learned. Learning is not sitting on a desk, and cramming your brain with knowledge that you're going to recite one day.”
> 
> “如果你的行为没有改变，你就没有学到东西。学习不是坐在桌子上，用你有一天要背诵的知识塞满你的大脑。”

Similar to the point I made in _[The Reading Obsession](https://neckar.substack.com/p/the-reading-obsession)_, he recommends balance between solitary learning (read a book, listen to a podcast etc.) and learning by engaging with the world and being social. This can be particularly important for people living in intellectual bubbles that easily turn into echo chambers (looking at you, New York and San Francisco…). As Alix likes to quote:

与我在“阅读痴迷”中提出的观点类似，他建议在独自学习（读书、听播客等）和通过融入世界和社交来学习之间取得平衡。这对于生活在很容易变成回音室的知识泡泡中的人们来说尤其重要（看看你，纽约和旧金山……）。正如 Alix 喜欢引用的那样：

> “A desk is a dangerous place from which to view the world.” John le Carré
> 
> “从办公桌看世界是一个危险的地方。”约翰·勒卡雷

This one was a little tangent but a mindset worth pointing out:  
这个有点离题，但值得指出的是一种心态：  

> “**The first mindset is don't do this job for the money. This is a very painful business**. **You're constantly faced with your mistakes.** The sort of pain that you take on a daily, weekly, even yearly basis, you better love the business, if you're going to last at it. And if you're going to do this for the money, yeah, you might get lucky and start in 2011 and go through 2021 and you made a lot of money. But odds are the first time that the market teaches you a lesson, you're going to quit and not have the result.”
> 
> “第一个心态是不要为了钱而做这份工作。这是一件非常痛苦的事情。你经常面临你的错误。你每天、每周、甚至每年都要承受的那种痛苦，如果你要坚持下去，你最好热爱这个行业。如果你打算为了钱而这样做，是的，你可能会很幸运，从 2011 年开始，到 2021 年，你赚了很多钱。但很有可能是市场第一次给你上课，你会放弃，但没有结果。”

The last sections contains frameworks, ideas, mental models, and books that can make you a better investor.

最后几节包含可以使您成为更好的投资者的框架、想法、心智模型和书籍。

Below are a few of my favorite quotes on mentors, studying great investors, culture at Tiger, failure point analysis, and the intriguing metaphor of futsal — accelerated learning due to a high number of reps over a short period of time. Something I want to look out for in the future. Enjoy!

以下是我最喜欢的一些关于导师的名言、研究伟大的投资者、Tiger 的文化、失败点分析，以及五人制足球的有趣比喻——由于在短时间内进行大量代表而加速学习。我想在未来寻找的东西。享受！

> **“The first condition you want to create is having mentors.** Stanley Druckenmiller says, if you're early in your career, and they give you a choice between a great mentor or higher pay, tick the mentor every time it's not even close. And don't even think about leaving that mentor until your learning curve peaks. Nothing to me is so invaluable as having great mentors. And a lot of kids are just too short sighted in terms of going for the short term money instead of preparing themselves for the longer term.
> 
> “你要创造的第一个条件是有导师。斯坦利·德鲁肯米勒 (Stanley Druckenmiller) 说，如果你处于职业生涯的早期，并且他们让你在一位优秀的导师或更高的薪水之间做出选择，那么在导师差得远的时候就勾选导师。在你的学习曲线达到顶峰之前，甚至不要考虑离开那个导师。对我来说，没有什么比拥有伟大的导师更宝贵的了。很多孩子在追求短期金钱而不是为长期做好准备方面过于短视。
> 
> Two problems here. One, **how do you find a mentor**? I would start with people in your field that you have direct access to or somebody else can introduce you to and you want to approach them. And you approach them using a technique that I learned from a professor at Columbia University. He says you approach them with three prongs. First prong is ‘this is what I admire about you.’ The second prong is ‘this is what I can do for you.’ And the third prong is ‘this is what you can do for me.’ Always make what you can do for them greater than what they can do for you. And if they don't respond, persist. **One thing to remember about highly successful people is they got to where they are through persistence. And what they really respect is people that show persistence.**
> 
> 这里有两个问题。第一，你如何找到导师？我会从你所在领域的人开始，你可以直接接触或者其他人可以向你介绍你并且你想接近他们。你使用我从哥伦比亚大学教授那里学到的技术来接近他们。他说你要用三管齐下来接近他们。第一个分支是“这就是我钦佩你的地方”。第二个分支是“这是我能为你做的。”第三个分支是“这就是你能为我做的”。永远做你能做的为他们做的比他们能为你做的更重要。如果他们没有回应，请坚持。关于非常成功的人要记住的一件事是，他们通过坚持不懈地到达了现在的位置。他们真正尊重的是那些表现出坚持的人。
> 
> The second problem you're going to encounter is **how to be a good mentee.** Part of the value they're going to add to you is not only teaching you things, but also introducing you to other people. And they're only going to do that if you're a good mentee. So follow their advice, show that you've put it into motion. If it worked, you tell them. Be grateful. If it hasn't worked, also tell them. They're going to want to give you even more advice. And when they see that you respond, and that you're somebody that is not wasting their time, then they'll introduce you to other people.
> 
> 您将遇到的第二个问题是如何成为一名优秀的学员。他们将为您增加的部分价值不仅是教您一些东西，而且还将您介绍给其他人。如果你是一个好的学员，他们只会这样做。所以听从他们的建议，表明你已经付诸行动了。如果它有效，你告诉他们。非常感激。如果它没有奏效，也告诉他们。他们会想给你更多的建议。当他们看到您做出回应，并且看到您没有在浪费他们的时间时，他们就会把您介绍给其他人。
> 
> **The third problem, I call it the upgrading your mentor problem.** Once you've gotten to a certain level, you start realizing that you need another mentor to get you to the next level. And what a lot of people do in a way is totally ignore the guy that helped you to get to the previous level and the upgrade to the next guy. That's a big problem. Well, if you keep doing that, and succeeding, you won't have a problem. But the problem happens when you fail at one level. And the guide that you left at the previous level is not there to pick you up as you fall. So **take your mentors along with you on your path to success**.”
> 
> 第三个问题，我称之为升级你的导师问题。一旦你达到了某个水平，你就会开始意识到你需要另一位导师来帮助你进入下一个水平。许多人在某种程度上所做的是完全忽略帮助您达到上一个级别并升级到下一个级别的人。这是个大问题。好吧，如果你继续这样做并取得成功，你就不会有问题。但是当你在一个层面上失败时，问题就会发生。你在上一关留下的向导不会在你跌倒时把你扶起来。因此，在您走向成功的道路上，请带上您的导师。”

> “**[Futsal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futsal)** is soccer at the fraction of the size of a football team pitch. The number of players is smaller. You would think that it increases the number of strategic interactions by double but actually it increases the number of interactions by eight to sometimes 16 times. And what that does is you're learning at a very, very fast clip. And one of the patterns that we've seen is great investors often have gone through a futsal period in their careers. So **Dan Loeb**, for example, in the early 90s, he **worked at Jeffries right at the moment when the Resolution Trust Corporation was selling off the problem assets of the savings and loan debacle** at discounted prices in a two year period. **He saw a deal every few days. And that increased the number of reps that he saw**. But also, he had great customers, he had a young David Einhorn and a young David Tepper as customers. And the exposure and the reps were amazing.”
> 
> “五人制足球是足球场规模的一小部分。玩家人数较少。你会认为它使战略交互的数量增加了一倍，但实际上它使交互的数量增加了八倍，有时甚至增加了 16 倍。这样做的目的是您正在以非常非常快的速度学习。我们看到的一种模式是，伟大的投资者通常在他们的职业生涯中经历过五人制足球时期。所以 Dan Loeb，例如，在 90 年代初期，他在 Jeffries 工作的时候，Resolution Trust Corporation 正在以两年的折扣价出售储蓄和贷款崩溃的问题资产。他每隔几天就会看到一笔交易。这增加了他看到的代表数量。而且，他有很棒的客户，他有年轻的大卫艾因霍恩和年轻的大卫泰珀作为客户。曝光率和代表都很棒。”

> “This is the main tool I used before I started my fund. I made a list of the smartest analysts, PMs, allocators, brokers and set up meetings with them. I said, Hey, I'm about to start a hedge fund. How can I fail in starting a hedge fund? The initial things they said I wrote down and went through each category. How can I fail at idea generation? How can I fail at portfolio management? How can I fail at risk management? How can I fail at hiring? How can I fail at leading an investment team and so on. I learned from each individual conversation but the full leverage was how much I learned from the aggregate conversation, because I found patterns that even some of the people I spoke with did not know about. This is a process that I do every couple of years.”
> 
> “这是我在开始我的基金之前使用的主要工具。我列了一张最聪明的分析师、产品经理、分配器、经纪人的名单，并安排与他们会面。我说，嘿，我要开始一个对冲基金。我怎样才能启动对冲基金？他们说的最初的事情我写下来并逐一检查了每个类别。我怎么会在创意产生时失败？我怎么会在投资组合管理上失败？我怎么会在风险管理上失败？我怎么会招聘失败？领导投资团队怎么会失败等等。我从每个单独的对话中学习，但充分的杠杆是我从聚合对话中学到了多少，因为我发现了甚至与我交谈的一些人都不知道的模式。这是我每两年做一次的过程。”

> “You want to study great investors, CEOs and leaders, but again, be careful of hero worship. I think we often imagine these individuals have qualities or abilities that are better than anyone else’s. And some do. But mostly they're schmucks like us. They have the same weaknesses, patterns, they self sabotage. And don't think that they play perfectly. Very often, they also may have gotten lucky and have gone through a certain environment. Other times, they have support structures that we don't see. You have to remember that you're never going to be able to replicate what they've done. Mostly because we're not going to go through the same environment that they went through.
> 
> “你想研究伟大的投资者、首席执行官和领导者，但同样要小心英雄崇拜。我认为我们经常想象这些人拥有比其他人更好的品质或能力。有些人这样做。但他们大多是像我们一样的笨蛋。他们有相同的弱点，模式，他们自我破坏。不要认为他们玩得很完美。很多时候，他们也可能是运气好，经历了某个环境。其他时候，他们有我们看不到的支持结构。你必须记住，你永远无法复制他们所做的事情。主要是因为我们不会经历他们经历过的相同环境。
> 
> **So how should you study a hero? You want to study their initial conditions.** What was the early context, circumstance and environment that shaped them? One thing that is often ignored by Buffett and Munger, for example, is that they grew up in the aftermath of the Great Depression. That really impacted the way they saw things. No wonder they were infatuated with value investing early on. **Who were their connectors, who were their filter aggregators. What hubs did they spend time at? Who was there? What books were they influenced by?** For example, Elon Musk loves the books of Iain Bank, the science fiction writer? What was their secret advantage? Sometimes they have an advantage that they never talk about, and figuring out what that is can lead to insights.”
> 
> 那么应该如何研究英雄呢？你想研究他们的初始条件。塑造他们的早期背景、情况和环境是什么？例如，巴菲特和芒格经常忽视的一件事是，他们是在大萧条之后长大的。这确实影响了他们看待事物的方式。难怪他们很早就迷恋价值投资。谁是他们的连接器，谁是他们的过滤器聚合器。他们在哪些枢纽度过了时光？那时谁在那里？他们受到了哪些书的影响？比如埃隆·马斯克就喜欢科幻作家伊恩·班克的书？他们的秘密优势是什么？有时他们有一个他们从不谈论的优势，弄清楚这是什么可以带来洞察力。”

> “I'm going through all of my anecdotes that I've picked up over the years. And there were two guys inside of Tiger in the 90s. One of them was Andreas Halvorsen. The second guy shall remain unnamed. If you were a young analyst, you went up to Andreas and said, Hey, I really like this idea. I want to pitch it to Julian. Andreas would say, let's work on it together. I'll help you shape the idea, point you in the right directions, the strengths and weaknesses of the idea, the process they should take, and so on. And then once you're ready, go and pitch it to Julian. And that analysts would go and pitch to Julian and Julian wouldn't even have a clue that Andreas had pushed this guy forward.
> 
> “我正在回顾我多年来收集的所有轶事。在 90 年代，Tiger 内部有两个人。其中之一是安德烈亚斯·哈尔沃森 (Andreas Halvorsen)。第二个人将保持匿名。如果你是一位年轻的分析师，你会走到安德烈亚斯面前说，嘿，我真的很喜欢这个想法。我想把它推销给朱利安。 Andreas 会说，让我们一起努力吧。我将帮助您塑造想法，为您指出正确的方向、想法的优势和劣势、他们应该采取的流程等等。然后一旦你准备好了，就去把它推销给朱利安。分析师会去向朱利安推销，而朱利安甚至不知道安德烈亚斯曾推动这个人前进。
> 
> The other guy would take the idea and speak to Julian and say, you know, I spoke to so and so. He's got an idea. I think the idea is okay, but it's not really fine tuned yet. I'm going to help them fine tune it. And then they would go and do that. That young analyst never really got the full credit from Julian. Guess which guy is actually the wealthiest and most successful fund manager today? And by the way, the second guy is also very successful, doesn't matter. But it's Andreas, right? So **you want to be that guy. You want to have a cultural impact on your business. Be the teacher.”**
> 
> 另一个人会接受这个想法并与 Julian 交谈并说，你知道，我和某某交谈过。他有个主意。我认为这个想法还可以，但还没有真正微调。我会帮助他们微调它。然后他们会去做那件事。这位年轻的分析师从未真正得到朱利安的全部信任。猜猜哪个人实际上是当今最富有和最成功的基金经理？顺便说一句，第二个人也很成功，没关系。但这是安德烈亚斯，对吧？所以你想成为那个人。您希望对您的业务产生文化影响。当老师吧。”
