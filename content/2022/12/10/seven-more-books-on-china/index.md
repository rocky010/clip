There’s only a very limited amount that you can understand about another country by reading books about it. I know this first-hand, from having read a ton of books about Japan while also living there for years. To the extent that anyone can ever really “understand” a whole country, you really just have to live there. Still, books can do a few important things for you here. They can open up a window into parts of a country that you probably wouldn’t encounter in your daily life — assembly lines, prisons, or national security think tanks. They can provide important historical context in order to understand modern politics. They can give you a good intro to the narratives that _other_ people use when they think about a country. And so on.

通过阅读有关另一个国家的书籍，您对另一个国家的了解非常有限。 我亲身体验过这一点，因为我在日本生活了多年，阅读了大量有关日本的书籍。 就任何人都能真正“理解”整个国家而言，你真的只需要住在那里。 不过，书籍在这里可以为您做一些重要的事情。 他们可以打开一扇窗户，了解您在日常生活中可能不会遇到的一个国家的某些部分——装配线、监狱或国家安全智囊团。 它们可以为理解现代政治提供重要的历史背景。 叙述 _他们可以很好地介绍其他_ 人在考虑一个国家时使用的 。 等等。

A little over a year ago, I decided to read a bunch of books about China, since U.S.-China relations are so important and have become so fraught. I am not, and will never be, a China expert — if you want those, check out [Dan Wang](https://twitter.com/danwwang), [Damien Ma](https://twitter.com/damienics), [Shuli Ren](https://twitter.com/shuli_ren), [Liqian Ren](https://twitter.com/liqian_ren), [Victor Shih](https://twitter.com/vshih2), [George Magnus](https://twitter.com/georgemagnus1), and [Barry Naughton](https://gps.ucsd.edu/faculty-directory/barry-naughton.html), or follow [my Twitter list for China news](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1523816906410524672). But China is an important topic that any economics blogger needs to think about, and the books I’ve read over the past year have definitely helped fill in some gaps in my background knowledge. In January, I did a writeup of the first six books:

一年多以前，我决定读一些关于中国的书，因为美中关系如此重要，而且变得如此令人担忧。 我不是，也永远不会是中国专家——如果你想要这些，请查看 [Dan Wang](https://twitter.com/danwwang) 、 [Damien Ma](https://twitter.com/damienics) 、 [Shuli Ren](https://twitter.com/shuli_ren) 、 [Liqian Ren](https://twitter.com/liqian_ren) 、 [Victor Shih](https://twitter.com/vshih2) 、 [George Magnus](https://twitter.com/georgemagnus1) 和 [Barry Naughton](https://gps.ucsd.edu/faculty-directory/barry-naughton.html) ，或关注 [我的 Twitter 中国新闻列表](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1523816906410524672) . 但中国是任何经济学博主都需要思考的重要话题，我过去一年阅读的书籍无疑帮助填补了我背景知识的一些空白。 一月份，我写了前六本书：

Here are seven more to complete the baker’s dozen.

这里还有七个来完成面包师的一打。

## [Middle Class Shanghai, by Cheng Li](https://www.amazon.com/Middle-Class-Shanghai-U-S-China-Engagement-ebook/dp/B0BL8PQPP5/)

## [上海中产阶级](https://www.amazon.com/Middle-Class-Shanghai-U-S-China-Engagement-ebook/dp/B0BL8PQPP5/) ,李成

This book came highly recommended by people whose viewpoints on China I trust, and I had high hopes for it. So that may be part of why the book left me bitterly and comprehensively disappointed.

这本书得到了我信任的对中国的看法的人的大力推荐，我对它寄予厚望。 所以这可能是这本书让我痛苦而全面地失望的部分原因。

_Middle Class Shanghai_ purports to be a book about U.S.-China engagement, and yet the book spends astonishingly little time on that topic. Mostly, it’s about the city of Shanghai — its history, its politics, its economics, its art and culture. That’s a fascinating topic in and of itself, but the book mostly discusses these topics in a very dry, high-level way, full of statistics and names and dates. Anecdotes and stories would have really helped the book here. Shanghai is one of the world’s great cities — a place where a number of my friends have lived, and which all of them universally praise. But none of the color and energy of that city comes through in this infodump.

_《上海中产阶级》_ 声称是一本关于美中交往的书，但该书在 该主题上花费的时间少得惊人。 主要是关于上海这座城市——它的历史、它的政治、它的经济、它的艺术和文化。 这本身就是一个引人入胜的话题，但本书主要以非常枯燥、高层次的方式讨论了这些话题，充满了统计数据、姓名和日期。 轶事和故事真的对这本书有帮助。 上海是世界上最伟大的城市之一——我的很多朋友都住过这里，而且他们都对上海赞不绝口。 但是这个信息转储中没有那个城市的色彩和活力。

More fundamentally, though, it’s not clear exactly why the author, Cheng Li, believes that Shanghai is the key to U.S.-China engagement — that the city and its middle class will somehow create a bridge between the two countries that will moderate the hawkish instincts in both. This is the thesis of the book, yet exactly how this is supposed to work is never really explained. The author’s own statistics show that the attitudes of Shanghai people who returned to their home city after studying in the U.S. are complex — they pick up liberal ideas like concern for the environment, but they also tend to be nationalistic. A quote at the beginning of the chapter on the attitudes of Shanghai returnees is “I hate American hegemony, and I love NBA games.” That’s hardly encouraging; I’m sure many of the citizens of Wilhelmine Germany loved French wine back in 1914. Anyway, if that typifies the attitude of the typical Shanghai exchange student, I am not optimistic about the attitude of the average Shanghai resident, to say nothing of the attitudes in China’s far less cosmopolitan regions.

不过，更根本的是，尚不清楚为什么作者李成认为上海是美中接触的关键——这座城市及其中产阶级将以某种方式在两国之间架起一座桥梁，缓和鹰派本能。同时。 这是本书的主题，但从未真正解释过它应该如何工作。 笔者自己的统计显示，留美归国的上海人心态复杂，既有关注环境等自由主义思想，也有民族主义倾向。 关于海归态度的章节开头有一句话是“我讨厌美国霸权，我喜欢NBA比赛”。 这并不令人鼓舞； 我敢肯定，1914 年威廉德国的许多市民都喜欢法国葡萄酒。不管怎样，如果这代表了典型的上海交换生的态度，我对普通上海人的态度并不乐观，更不用说中国远不那么国际化的地区的态度。

In any case, other than cultural contact and exchange, there are few other suggestions for how Shanghai’s middle class can reshape U.S.-China engagement. It’s clear that the author really loves Shanghai, and that he also really wants the U.S. and China to put aside their differences and get along, but I think it was a mistake to try to shoehorn both of those things into a single book.

无论如何，除了文化接触和交流之外，对于上海的中产阶级如何重塑美中关系，几乎没有其他建议。 很明显，作者真的很喜欢上海，他也很希望美国和中国能够抛开分歧和睦相处，但我认为把这两件事硬塞进一本书里是错误的。

That said, I also think that Li’s plea for engagement falls flat even on its own. By the time _Middle Class Shanghai_ was published in 2021, it was already clear that the countries had grown too far apart. Li’s arguments that engagement is still feasible often take on a desperate character — first insisting that China is far from constituting a threat to the U.S., then insisting that China’s rise is inevitable and the U.S. cannot hope to contest it, _sometimes even within the same paragraph_. It feels like throwing a bunch of arguments against a wall and hoping something will stick. Nothing really does. And in the year since the book came out, Xi’s industrial crackdowns and utter marginalization of any political factions besides his own have already invalidated many of _Middle Class Shanghai_’s more optimistic pronouncements.

话虽如此，我也认为李的订婚请求本身也是站不住脚的。 出版时 _到 2021 年上海中产阶级_ ，已经很明显这些国家之间的差距太大了。 李关于接触仍然可行的论点往往具有绝望的性质——先是坚持中国远未对美国构成威胁，然后坚持认为中国的崛起是不可避免的，美国不能指望与之抗衡，有时甚至在同一段 _中_ . 感觉就像把一堆论据扔在墙上，希望有什么能坚持下去。 什么都没有。 在这本书出版后的一年里，习近平的工业镇压和对除他自己之外的任何政治派别的彻底边缘化已经使 _上海中产阶级_ 的许多乐观声明无效。

I do believe that the U.S. and China will be friends someday. They’re natural allies, and they were often allies in the past, and great-power conflict is a very bad thing. Their societies and cultures are far more similar than either would readily admit. But in the short run, the hope that these two societies would grow together happily and peacefully in the early 21st century has been decisively dashed. _Middle Class Shanghai_ feels like the last gasp of that failed dream. But someday the dream will rise again.

我相信美中终有一天会成为朋友。 他们是天然的盟友，他们过去经常是盟友，大国冲突是一件非常糟糕的事情。 他们的社会和文化比任何人都愿意承认的要相似得多。 但在短期内，这两个社会在 21 世纪初幸福和平地共同成长的希望已经彻底破灭。 _上海的中产阶级_ 感觉像是那个失败梦想的最后一口气。 但总有一天梦想会再次升起。


## [China’s Gilded Age, by Yuen Yuen Ang](https://www.amazon.com/Chinas-Gilded-Age-Economic-Corruption-ebook/dp/B087D6QNTM/)
## [中国的镀金时代](https://www.amazon.com/Chinas-Gilded-Age-Economic-Corruption-ebook/dp/B087D6QNTM/) ，Yuen Yuen Ang

This book is only somewhat about China itself; really, it’s a fascinating study of the relationship between corruption and economic development, using China as an example. The conventional wisdom is that corruption is bad for growth, but Ang argues that this depends on what _type_ of corruption prevails. Basically, she argues, there are two types, which I will paraphrase as:

这本书只是在某种程度上是关于中国本身的； 确实，这是一项关于腐败与经济发展之间关系的有趣研究，以中国为例。 传统观点认为腐败不利于增长，但 Ang 认为这取决于哪种 _类型_ 的腐败盛行。 她认为，基本上有两种类型，我将其解释为：

1.  government officials embezzling money and assets from the state, and
    
2.  government officials letting private businesspeople bribe them into giving them favorable treatment.
    

1.  国家工作人员贪污国家财物的；
    
2.  政府官员让私人商人贿赂他们给予他们优惠待遇。
    

Ang is not the first person I’ve seen argue that the second type of corruption can actually speed development instead of slowing it down, but she brings the best data and chooses the best examples. The basic argument is that “[access money](https://oecd-development-matters.org/2020/06/25/unbundling-corruption-why-it-matters-and-how-to-do-it//)” aligns the incentives of the private and public sectors — basically creating a [development state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_state) by the back door, by giving government officials an unearned but effective equity stake in the companies they oversee. That can obviously lead to negative consequences in the long run (inefficient cronyism, perceptions of unfairness, environmental destruction and other negative externalities), but in the short run it helps get a lot of things built very quickly.

Ang 并不是我见过的第一个争论第二种类型的腐败实际上可以加速而不是减缓发展的人，但她带来了最好的数据并选择了最好的例子。 基本论点是，“ [准入金](https://oecd-development-matters.org/2020/06/25/unbundling-corruption-why-it-matters-and-how-to-do-it//) ”使私营部门和公共部门的激励措施保持一致——基本上是 [创造一种发展状态](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_state) 通过后门 ，让政府官员在他们监管的公司中获得不劳而获但有效的股权。 从长远来看，这显然会导致负面后果（低效的任人唯亲、对不公平的看法、环境破坏和其他负面外部性），但从短期来看，它有助于快速建立很多东西。

The most fascinating part of the book is when Ang shows that the U.S., during its own Gilded Age, was marked by a very similar type of corruption. I’m reminded of [George Plunkett’s speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Plunkitt#:~:text=For%20honest%20graft%2C%20one%20pursues,This%20was%20honest%20graft.) on the difference between “dishonest graft” (i.e. theft) and “honest graft” (facilitation of development for personal gain), in which he declared:

这本书最引人入胜的部分是 Ang 展示了美国在其镀金时代的标志是一种非常相似的腐败。 我想起了 [George Plunkett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Plunkitt#:~:text=For%20honest%20graft%2C%20one%20pursues,This%20was%20honest%20graft.) 关于“不诚实贪污”（即盗窃）和“诚实贪污”（为个人利益促进发展）之间的区别的演讲，他在演讲中宣称：

> "I could get nothin' at a bargain but a big piece of swamp, but I took it fast enough and held on to it. What turned out was just what I counted on. They couldn't make the park complete without Plunkitt's swamp, and they had to pay a good price for it. Anything dishonest in that?"
> 
> “除了一大片沼泽，我什么也买不到，但我很快就抓住了它并坚持了下来。结果正是我所指望的。没有 Plunkitt 的沼泽，他们就无法完成公园，他们不得不为此付出高昂的代价。这有什么不诚实的地方吗？

This is basically access money, and if Ang is right, it could help explain how the U.S. rose to be the world’s premier industrial power. Just another way in which the U.S. and China are more similar than they’d like to admit.

这基本上是获取资金，如果 Ang 是对的，它可以帮助解释美国如何崛起为世界首屈一指的工业强国。 这只是美国和中国比他们愿意承认的更相似的另一种方式。


## [One Child, by Mei Fong](https://www.amazon.com/One-Child-Chinas-Radical-Experiment-ebook/dp/B00QPHNV4E/)
## [一个孩子](https://www.amazon.com/One-Child-Chinas-Radical-Experiment-ebook/dp/B00QPHNV4E/),美芳

This book, about the consequences of China’s now-defunct one-child policy, is very well-written. It’s chock full of eye-popping anecdotes, useful statistics, and cogently made arguments. If you’re interested in what China’s society was like in previous decades, you should definitely read it.

这本书写的很好，讲述了中国现已废除的独生子女政策的后果。 它充满了令人瞠目结舌的奇闻轶事、有用的统计数据和令人信服的论据。 如果你对前几十年的中国社会感兴趣，你一定要读一读。

That said, one of the book’s arguments tends to undermine the importance of the others. As Fong notes, China’s fertility rates were dropping fast well before the implementation of the one-child policy, and other East Asian countries that never had a coercive policy (South Korea, Taiwan, Japan) have also seen fertility fall to low levels. That means that many of the changes Fong describes would have happened without the policy.

也就是说，书中的一个论点往往会削弱其他论点的重要性。 正如 Fong 指出的那样，中国的生育率早在实施独生子女政策之前就在迅速下降，而其他从未实行过强制性政策的东亚国家（韩国、台湾、日本）的生育率也已降至低水平。 这意味着如果没有该政策，Fong 描述的许多变化也会发生。

Many, but not all of them. The most important effect of the one-child regime, and one which Fong documents extensively, is an increase in social control. The policy gave the Chinese government an excuse to be extremely intrusive into people’s lives, which helped get the populace accustomed to such intrusions. We can see this vividly playing out in the era of Zero Covid, which has in some sense replaced the one-child policy as an excuse for totalitarianism.

很多，但不是全部。 一胎化制度最重要的影响，也是 Fong 广泛记录的影响，是社会控制的加强。 该政策为中国政府提供了极度干预人们生活的借口，这有助于让民众习惯这种干预。 我们可以在“零新冠”时代生动地看到这一点，它在某种意义上取代了独生子女政策成为极权主义的借口。

## [China’s Economy, by Arthur Kroeber](https://www.amazon.com/Chinas-Economy-Everyone-Needs-Know®/dp/0190239034 )

## [中国经济](https://www.amazon.com/Chinas-Economy-Everyone-Needs-Know®/dp/0190239034 ) , Kroeber

This book, recommended to me by Dan Wang, was truly excellent. It doesn’t have anecdotes, but it doesn’t need them; it tells you interesting facts, clearly and plainly. And unlike many books about China’s economy, _China’s Economy_ taught me a lot of stuff that I didn’t already know from reading news articles, academic papers, and think tank reports.

这本书是丹王推荐给我的，真的很棒。 它没有轶事，但也不需要它们； 它清楚明了地告诉您有趣的事实。 与许多关于中国经济的书籍不同， _《中国经济》_ 教会了我很多我在阅读新闻文章、学术论文和智库报告时所不知道的东西。

For example, I didn’t realize how fiscally decentralized China is. For some reason, almost no one talks about this. Local governments are required to raise a lot of the country’s revenue on their own, which is a major reason they developed the system of selling land for money rather than implementing a property tax. That system worked well enough while it lasted, but eventually everything gets built out and you can’t do it anymore, and you have to switch to property taxes. In the meantime, local governments get more money in the short term if they encourage and hype a bunch of development projects that may not be long-term viable. And that helps to explain the unusual importance of real estate to the Chinese economy, as well as the country’s stupendous and ongoing housing crash. That link is well-known, but Kroeber is smart to connect it to the fundamental problem of fiscal decentralization.

例如，我没有意识到中国的财政分权程度如何。 出于某种原因，几乎没有人谈论这个。 地方政府需要自己筹集国家的大量收入，这是他们制定卖地换钱制度而不是征收财产税的主要原因。 该系统在持续期间运行得很好，但最终一切都建成了，你不能再这样做了，你必须转向财产税。 与此同时，如果地方政府鼓励和炒作一堆可能不具备长期可行性的开发项目，那么他们会在短期内获得更多资金。 这有助于解释房地产对中国经济的不同寻常的重要性，以及该国持续不断的巨大房地产崩盘。 这种联系众所周知，但 Kroeber 聪明地将其与财政分权的根本问题联系起来。

There are many other useful nuggets in this book. Kroeber managed to successfully predict the timing of the housing boom’s end, and the book explains his reasoning — including, crucially, the fact that floor space per person is approaching rich-world levels. He also discusses China’s difficulty in shifting from low-value middle-of-the-supply-chain manufacturing to high-value advanced manufacturing and branding, which has obvious implications for [decoupling](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-end-of-the-system-of-the-world). All in all, a very readable and highly useful book.

本书中还有许多其他有用的内容。 Kroeber 成功地预测了房地产繁荣结束的时间，这本书解释了他的推理——包括，至关重要的是，人均建筑面积正在接近富裕世界的水平。 他还讨论了中国难以从低价值的供应链中间制造转向高价值的先进制造和品牌，这对 [脱钩](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-end-of-the-system-of-the-world) 有明显的影响。 总而言之，这是一本非常易读且非常有用的书。

## [The Long Game, by Rush Doshi](https://www.amazon.com/Long-Game-Strategy-Displace-American-ebook/dp/B0971BRJ6V/)
## [漫长的游戏 ](https://www.amazon.com/Long-Game-Strategy-Displace-American-ebook/dp/B0971BRJ6V/)，作者：拉什·多西

At the beginning of my reading series, I read a book called _[The Hundred-Year Marathon](https://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Year-Marathon-Strategy-Replace-Superpower-ebook/dp/B00IWUI7B4/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+hundred+year+marathon&qid=1641705347&s=digital-text&sprefix=the+hundred+year+ma%2Cdigital-text%2C127&sr=1-1)_, by Michael Pillsbury. I found the tone quite lurid and alarmist, which detracted from the book’s overall message that we should be worried about China’s plans to supplant U.S. hegemony. _The Long Game_ has basically the same thesis, but with the exact opposite tone, which makes it less fun to read but far more convincing (at least to a dry, analytical nerd like myself).

在我的阅读系列开始时，我读了迈克尔·皮尔斯伯里 (Michael Pillsbury) 的一本名为《 _[百年马拉松》(The Hundred-Year Marathon)](https://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Year-Marathon-Strategy-Replace-Superpower-ebook/dp/B00IWUI7B4/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+hundred+year+marathon&qid=1641705347&s=digital-text&sprefix=the+hundred+year+ma%2Cdigital-text%2C127&sr=1-1)_ 的书。 我发现这种语气相当耸人听闻和危言耸听，这削弱了本书的整体信息，即我们应该担心中国取代美国霸权的计划。 _The Long Game 的_ 论点基本相同，但语气完全相反，这使得它读起来没那么有趣，但更有说服力（至少对像我这样枯燥、善于分析的书呆子来说是这样）。

Basically, Doshi has pored over untold mountains of Chinese official documents, including speeches, statements, communiques, and so on (it is a marvel that this did not drive him clinically insane). The Chinese Communist Party tends to emphasize a few key phrases or slogans that it repeats ad infinitum — “common prosperity”, “comprehensive national power”, etc. — and the main task of figuring out what the CCP wants to do is just to figure out how they interpret the phrases they made up. The key phrase Doshi focuses on is “great changes unseen in a century”, which Xi Jinping likes to talk about a lot in connection with foreign policy.

基本上，多西仔细研究了数不清的中国官方文件，包括演讲、声明、公报等等（这并没有使他精神错乱，这真是一个奇迹）。 中国共产党倾向于强调它无限重复的几个关键短语或口号——“共同繁荣”、“综合国力”等——而弄清楚中共想要做什么的主要任务只是弄清楚了解他们如何解释他们组成的短语。 多西强调的关键词是“百年未有之大变局”，这是习近平在外交政策中经常挂在嘴边的。

Doshi’s thesis is that “great changes unseen in a century” basically just means China supplanting the U.S. as global hegemon. The entire book is really just one long, careful defense of this interpretation. Doshi painstakingly goes through a bunch of possible alternative interpretations of China’s phrasing and actions and shows that they don’t really make sense. So now we can be pretty sure — China, or at least Xi Jinping, really does want to supplant the U.S. as the global hegemon. If you read the news, this might strike you as obvious, but international relations people take this stuff very seriously and try to be very careful. Or at least, some of them do.

多西的论点是，“百年未有之大变局”基本上就是中国取代美国成为全球霸主。 整本书实际上只是对这种解释的一次冗长而谨慎的辩护。 多西煞费苦心地对中国的措辞和行动进行了一系列可能的替代解释，并表明它们实际上没有意义。 所以现在我们可以非常确定——中国，或者至少是习近平，真的想要取代美国成为全球霸主。 如果你看过新闻，你可能会觉得这很明显，但国际关系人士非常重视这件事，并尽量小心。 或者至少，他们中的一些人这样做。

## [中国眼中的世界 ，伊丽莎白·易明](https://www.amazon.com/World-According-China-Elizabeth-Economy-ebook/dp/B09KMJMJNN/)

[Elizabeth Economy](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/authors/elizabeth-economy) is an extremely knowledgeable and skilled writer, and a perennially great source of China news and analysis. Her fatal weakness as a book author, however, is that she chooses to write books about [extremely up-to-date events](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/hu-jintao-was-very-underrated), so that by the time the book comes out, events have already moved on. I say this in a tongue-in-cheek manner, because _The World According to China_ is a good and comprehensive book about China’s aforementioned attempts to supplant the U.S. as the global hegemon. It covers technology, diplomacy, economics, internal repression, and so on. But because it came out almost a year ago, and events are moving very fast, it doesn’t include things like [Biden’s recent export controls](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/biden-declares-economic-war-on-the). If you’re interested in China’s competitive strategy and you want a backgrounder on what it’s been trying to do over the past five or seven years, grab a copy of _The World According to China_ — just realize that you’ll still have to read a lot of news in order to fully catch up.

[Elizabeth Economy](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/authors/elizabeth-economy) 是一位知识渊博、技巧娴熟的作家，并且一直是中国新闻和分析的重要来源。 然而，她作为一个作家的致命弱点是，她选择写关于 [非常新的事件的](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/hu-jintao-was-very-underrated) 书，以至于当这本书出版时，事件已经发生了。 我以半开玩笑的方式这么说，因为《 _中国眼中的世界》_ 是一本关于中国上述试图取代美国成为全球霸主的很好而全面的书。 它涵盖了技术、外交、经济、内部镇压等等。 但因为它差不多一年前就出来了，而且事态发展得很快，所以它不包括 [拜登最近的出口管制](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/biden-declares-economic-war-on-the) 之类的东西。 如果你对中国的竞争战略感兴趣，并且想了解它在过去五七年里一直在努力做的事情的背景资料，请拿一本《中国眼中的 _世界》_ ——只是要意识到你仍然需要阅读一本很多新闻才能完全赶上。

Many people suggested that I read this long and magisterial history of modern China, which covers the period from the late Ming dynasty through the Tiananmen massacre in 1989. I found it extremely fun and fascinating. Much of it was stuff I already knew, but there were a few tidbits that were new to me:

很多人建议我读一读这部宏大的近代中国史，从晚明到1989年天安门大屠杀，我觉得非常有趣和引人入胜。 其中大部分是我已经知道的东西，但有一些花絮对我来说是新的：

    
-   I didn’t realize, until now, how deeply involved Russia was in the creation of the modern Chinese state. Soviet advisors were deeply enmeshed in both the nationalist KMT and the CCP, and were constantly trying to direct the country’s development. Soviet technology and military organization also had a big influence. When you think about Russia-China relations in the era of Putin and Xi, you should probably be aware of this history.
    
    直到现在，我才意识到俄罗斯对现代中国国家的创建有多么深入的参与。 苏联顾问深深扎根于民族主义的国民党和中共，并不断试图指导国家的发展。 苏联的技术和军事组织也产生了很大的影响。 当你想到普京和习近平时代的俄中关系时，你可能应该了解这段历史。
    
    
-   Mao’s leadership strategy was markedly different from that of Xi Jinping, or even other contemporaries like Stalin or Hitler. In order to maintain total control of a huge, fractious, and quickly evolving Chinese state, he provoked all possible rivals into a constant state of internecine warfare. One of his favorite strategies was to elevate a favorite subordinate to a position of prestige and power, then denounce them, and carry out a major campaign designed to purge the manufactured rival’s supposed influence from Chinese culture and society. This strategy was incredibly effective at keeping Mao in supreme power, but had the unfortunate side effect of killing millions of people and making sure the country stayed poor and violent.
    
    毛泽东的领导战略明显不同于习近平，甚至与斯大林或希特勒等同时代的其他人。 为了保持对庞大、暴躁、快速发展的中国国家的完全控制，他激怒了所有可能的对手，使其陷入持续不断的自相残杀状态。 他最喜欢的策略之一是将最喜欢的下属提升到威望和权力的位置，然后谴责他们，并开展一场旨在从中国文化和社会中清除制造对手的所谓影响的重大运动。 这一策略在保持毛泽东的最高权力方面非常有效，但不幸的是，它的副作用是杀死了数百万人，并确保该国保持贫穷和暴力。
    
    
-   China’s aforementioned problems with fiscal decentralization date back very far — the Ming dynasty had similar issues.
    
    上述中国财政分权的问题可以追溯到很久以前——明朝也有类似的问题。
    
    
-   As far back as the early 1900s, a lot of people around the world expected China to become the world’s manufacturing hub, based on its massive reservoir of cheap labor. Only the constant internal and externally-imposed chaos delayed this.
    
    早在 20 世纪 00 年代初，世界上就有很多人期望中国凭借其庞大的廉价劳动力储备成为世界制造业中心。 只有不断的内部和外部强加的混乱才推迟了这一点。
    
    
-   I really knew this before, but Spence’s history reinforces the fact that Deng Xiaoping is truly the Great Man of modern Chinese history, for better and for worse. Until Xi came in and started trashing the system Deng built, of course.
    
    我以前真的知道这一点，但斯宾塞的历史强化了一个事实，即邓小平是中国现代史上真正的伟人，无论是好是坏。 当然，直到习近平上台并开始破坏邓小平建立的制度。
    

So that’s it for the China Book Series. Right now I’m reading a bunch of different stuff, but I’m trying to read all the good books about [WW2 production and public-private cooperation](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/book-review-freedoms-forge) in that era, in order to better understand how industrial policy can succeed. I still have to read _[Destructive Creation](https://www.amazon.com/Destructive-Creation-American-Business-Politics/dp/0812224310/ref=sr_1_1?crid=AQO6A8YY963N&keywords=destructive+creation&qid=1668890972&s=books&sprefix=destructive+creation%2Cstripbooks%2C165&sr=1-1)_, _[The Economic Consequences of U.S. Mobilization for the Second World War](https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Consequences-Mobilization-Second-World/dp/0300251025/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=economic+consequences+of+u.s.+mobilization+for+the+second+world+war&qid=1668890995&s=books&sprefix=The+Economic+Consequences+of+U.S.+%2Cstripbooks%2C187&sr=1-1)_, _[Tuxedo Park](https://www.amazon.com/Tuxedo-Park-Street-Science-Changed-ebook/dp/B00F8KUJ58/ref=sr_1_1?crid=34M2KPMYN39ZF&keywords=tuxedo+park&qid=1668891108&sprefix=tuxedo+park%2Caps%2C161&sr=8-1)_, and _[The Struggle for Survival](https://www.amazon.com/Struggle-Survival-Eliot-Janeway/dp/B00AGKZPIG/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1FZLWQ865FP2N&keywords=eliot+janeway&qid=1668891022&s=books&sprefix=eliot+janeway%2Cstripbooks%2C143&sr=1-4)_. I’m also planning to read _[The Idea Factory](https://www.amazon.com/Idea-Factory-Great-American-Innovation-ebook/dp/B005GSZIWG/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+idea+factory&qid=1668891092&sprefix=the+idea+facto%2Caps%2C195&sr=8-1)_ (about Bell Labs), and [Markets, Minds, and Money](https://www.amazon.com/Markets-Minds-Money-University-Research-ebook/dp/B082DKMJQX/ref=sr_1_1?crid=24M1I8PZZ5RT4&keywords=markets+minds+and+money&qid=1668891173&sprefix=markets+minds+and+money%2Caps%2C126&sr=8-1) (about the U.S. university system). So I think my next “reading list” post will probably be about industrial policy. As always, let me know if you have any good suggestions!

中国图书系列就是这样。 好书 [现在我正在阅读很多不同的东西，但我正在尝试阅读所有关于那个时代二战生产和公私合作的](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/book-review-freedoms-forge) ，以便更好地理解产业政策如何取得成功。 我仍然需要阅读 _[破坏性创造](https://www.amazon.com/Destructive-Creation-American-Business-Politics/dp/0812224310/ref=sr_1_1?crid=AQO6A8YY963N&keywords=destructive+creation&qid=1668890972&s=books&sprefix=destructive+creation%2Cstripbooks%2C165&sr=1-1)_ 、 _[二战美国动员的经济后果](https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Consequences-Mobilization-Second-World/dp/0300251025/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=economic+consequences+of+u.s.+mobilization+for+the+second+world+war&qid=1668890995&s=books&sprefix=The+Economic+Consequences+of+U.S.+%2Cstripbooks%2C187&sr=1-1)_ 、 _[燕尾服公园](https://www.amazon.com/Tuxedo-Park-Street-Science-Changed-ebook/dp/B00F8KUJ58/ref=sr_1_1?crid=34M2KPMYN39ZF&keywords=tuxedo+park&qid=1668891108&sprefix=tuxedo+park%2Caps%2C161&sr=8-1)_ 和 _[生存斗争](https://www.amazon.com/Struggle-Survival-Eliot-Janeway/dp/B00AGKZPIG/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1FZLWQ865FP2N&keywords=eliot+janeway&qid=1668891022&s=books&sprefix=eliot+janeway%2Cstripbooks%2C143&sr=1-4)_ 。 我还打算阅读 _[The Idea Factory](https://www.amazon.com/Idea-Factory-Great-American-Innovation-ebook/dp/B005GSZIWG/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+idea+factory&qid=1668891092&sprefix=the+idea+facto%2Caps%2C195&sr=8-1)_ （关于贝尔实验室）和 [Markets, Minds, and Money](https://www.amazon.com/Markets-Minds-Money-University-Research-ebook/dp/B082DKMJQX/ref=sr_1_1?crid=24M1I8PZZ5RT4&keywords=markets+minds+and+money&qid=1668891173&sprefix=markets+minds+and+money%2Caps%2C126&sr=8-1) （关于美国大学系统）。 所以我认为我的下一篇“阅读清单”帖子可能是关于产业政策的。 一如既往，如果您有任何好的建议，请告诉我！
