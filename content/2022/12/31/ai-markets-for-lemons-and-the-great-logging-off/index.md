I think it's fair to say that people, including myself, have consistently underestimated the pace and capabilities of AI technology. It's entirely possible that we'll start to run up against some sorts of physical or theoretical limits soon, but even if that hits us tomorrow, the amount of raw power that's been unlocked in the last year alone – the tech that's already _here_ – already has the potential to change things in massive waves.

我认为可以公平地说，包括我自己在内的人们一直低估了人工智能技术的发展速度和能力。我们完全有可能很快就会开始遇到某种物理或理论限制，但即使明天我们遇到了这种情况，仅在去年就已经解锁的原始能量——已经存在的技术——已经有可能在巨大的波浪中改变事物。

In the coming year I'd like to explore a lot of these different scenarios. I'm not necessarily super confident in any one of my predictions coming to pass, but I think it's important to explore and consider various possibilities.

在接下来的一年里，我想探索很多这些不同的场景。我不一定对我的任何一个预测都非常有信心，但我认为探索和考虑各种可能性很重要。

I'm a strange creature in that I'm equal parts techno-optimist and neo-luddite depending on which day of the week it is. I think AI has the potential to massively enrich and empower the human race, but it also has some deeply troubling implications. Today's post paints one of those troubling possible futures.

我是一个奇怪的生物，因为我既是技术乐观主义者又是新勒德分子，这取决于星期几。我认为人工智能有潜力极大地丰富和赋予人类力量，但它也有一些令人深感不安的影响。今天的帖子描绘了那些令人不安的可能未来之一。

Summary: 

**A Market for Lemons**  
In which the internet gets clogged with piles of semi-intelligent spam, breaking the default assumption that the "person" you're talking to is _human._

柠檬市场 互联网被成堆的半智能垃圾邮件堵塞，打破了与你交谈的“人”是人类的默认假设。

**The Great Logging Off**  
In which human biological and cultural evolution responds to the new super drugs we've unleashed upon ourselves for better and for worse.

伟大的注销 在其中人类生物和文化进化对我们释放给自己的新超级药物作出反应，无论好坏。

## A Market for Lemons  
柠檬市场  

First I need to bring in a market failure concept from economics called a "Market for Lemons." Let's say you have a used car you'd like to sell. It's a pretty good car. But the problem is, you can't _prove_ it's good. For all the buyer knows, your car is actually a _lemon–_a used car that _seems_ fine on the day it's purchased, but is actually going to break down in horrible ways days later, after which you are long gone with the money and the buyer is screwed. As it so happen, your actually good used car–a _plum–_is not a lemon, but because you can't _prove_ it's not a lemon, you can't charge the price a plum should command. This sucks for anyone trying to sell a plum.

首先，我需要引入经济学中的市场失灵概念，称为“柠檬市场”。假设您有一辆想要出售的二手车。这是一辆相当不错的车。但问题是，你无法证明它是好的。买家都知道，你的车实际上是一个柠檬——一辆二手车，在购买的那天看起来还不错，但实际上几天后就会以可怕的方式抛锚，之后你早就带着钱和买家走了被搞砸了。事实上，你真正好的二手车——李子——不是柠檬，但因为你不能证明它不是柠檬，你不能收取李子应有的价格。这对任何想卖李子的人来说都很糟糕。

The average selling price of any used car in the market depends on the ratio of plums to lemons because every buyer's price is discounted by the risk of getting stuck with a lemon. So long as there's even a few lemons in the market, the average market price for a used car will always be slightly lower than what a genuine plum would go for in a world where where buyers could accurately distinguish them.

市场上任何二手车的平均售价取决于李子与柠檬的比率，因为每个买家的价格都会因陷入柠檬的风险而打折。只要市场上有哪怕是几个柠檬，二手车的平均市场价格总是会略低于真正的李子在买家可以准确区分它们的世界中的价格。

This means sellers of plums start to take their merchandise off the open market. If you can't sell your plum for what it's actually worth, you might as well drive it yourself until it's dead, give it to a family member, or sell it off the open market to a friend who knows and trusts you. The problem is, now there's one less plum on the market, which increases every buyer's risk of purchasing a lemon, which means the average selling price of all used cars goes down, which means more plums leave the market, and the vicious cycle continues until you've got nothing left but a "market for lemons."

这意味着李子卖家开始从公开市场撤出他们的商品。如果你不能以实际价值出售你的李子，你还不如自己开车直到它死了，把它送给家人，或者在公开市场上把它卖给认识和信任你的朋友。问题是，现在市场上少了一个李子，这增加了每个买家购买柠檬的风险，这意味着所有二手车的平均售价下降，这意味着更多的李子离开市场，恶性循环一直持续到除了“柠檬市场”，你什么都没有了。

The surest sign of a market for lemons is when everything for sale is garbage, _and_ nobody has an incentive to put something up for sale that's _not_ garbage, because they have no way to credibly signal _their_ offerings aren't garbage, too.

柠檬市场最确定的标志是出售的所有东西都是垃圾，没有人有动力出售不是垃圾的东西，因为他们没有办法令人信服地表明他们的产品也不是垃圾。

To a certain extent this has already been happening to many parts of our great global telecommunications network. For instance, when was the last time you answered a phone call from an unknown number at a time you weren't expecting a call? Back in the early 1990's it would never occur to me not to answer the phone, even though caller ID had yet to be invented, because 90% of the time it was a genuine human being someone in my family knew personally.

在某种程度上，这已经发生在我们庞大的全球电信网络的许多地方。例如，您最后一次接听陌生号码打来的电话是什么时候？回到 1990 年代初期，我永远不会想到不接电话，即使来电显示尚未发明，因为 90% 的时间它是我家人认识的真正的人。

(In this case the caller is the "seller," and when I "buy" a phone call by answering it, I'm paying with my time – [four currencies theory](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/piracy-and-the-four-currencies/)!)

（在这种情况下，来电者是“卖方”，当我通过接听电话来“购买”电话时，我是在用我的时间付款——四种货币理论！）

The good news is, we know how to fix the root problem of information asymmetry. In the case of used cars, there are now services like CarFax and CarMax and the whole "certified pre-owned vehicle" thing that make it a lot easier to know a car's history before you buy it. And even in the old days, you could insist on taking the car to your local mechanic first. Similar fixes have come for spam phone calls – caller ID makes it clear when the caller is someone from my contacts list, and iOS now even pre-flags suspicious calls as probable spam. And in the case of people I might want to talk to but aren't in my contact list yet, in almost all cases they'll have scheduled the call ahead of time.

好消息是，我们知道如何解决信息不对称的根本问题。就二手车而言，现在有 CarFax 和 CarMax 等服务以及整个“经过认证的二手车”服务，让您在购买前更容易了解汽车的历史。即使在过去，您也可以坚持先把车开到当地的机械师那里。类似的修复程序也适用于垃圾电话——当来电者是我的联系人列表中的某个人时，来电显示会一目了然，iOS 现在甚至可以预先将可疑电话标记为可能的垃圾电话。对于我可能想与之交谈但不在我的联系人列表中的人，几乎在所有情况下他们都会提前安排通话时间。

So markets for lemons are fixable. But even so, lemons should be understood as a form of market pollution, and if enough of them build up you wind up in a [Red Queen's Race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen's_race) to outpace them, risking a death spiral.

所以柠檬市场是可以固定的。但即便如此，柠檬也应该被理解为一种市场污染形式，如果它们堆积得足够多，你就会在一场红皇后赛跑中超越它们，冒着死亡螺旋的风险。

Okay, so what does this have to do with AI?  
好的，那么这与 AI 有什么关系呢？  

Up until now, all forms of spam, catfishing, social engineering, forum brigading, etc, have more or less been bottlenecked by the capabilities and energy of individual human beings. Sure, you can automate spam, but typically only by duplicating a rote message, which becomes easy to spot. There's always been a hard tradeoff between _quantity_ and _quality_ of the sort of operation you want to run. With AI chatbots, not only can you effortlessly spin up a bunch of unique and differentiated messages, but they can also _respond dynamically_ as if they were a person.

迄今为止，各种形式的垃圾邮件、鲶鱼钓鱼、社会工程、论坛群发等都或多或少地受到了个人能力和精力的瓶颈。当然，您可以自动发送垃圾邮件，但通常只能通过复制死记硬背的消息来实现，这很容易被发现。在您要运行的那种操作的数量和质量之间始终存在艰难的权衡。使用 AI 聊天机器人，您不仅可以毫不费力地发出一堆独特且差异化的消息，而且它们还可以像真人一样动态响应。

What happens when anyone can spin up a thousand social media accounts at the click of a button, where each account picks a consistent persona and sticks to it – happily posting away about one of their hobbies like knitting or trout fishing or whatever, while simultaneously building up a credible and inobtrusive post history in another plausible side hobby that all these accounts happen to share – geopolitics, let's say – all until it's time for the sock puppet master to light the bat signal and manufacture some consensus?

当任何人只需点击一个按钮就可以启动一千个社交媒体账户时，会发生什么情况，每个账户都会选择一个一致的角色并坚持下去——愉快地发布他们的爱好之一，比如编织或钓鳟鱼等等，同时建立在所有这些帐户碰巧共享的另一个似是而非的业余爱好中建立一个可信且不引人注目的帖子历史 - 比方说地缘政治 - 一直到袜子木偶大师点亮蝙蝠信号并达成共识的时候？

What happens when every online open lobby multiplayer game is choked with cheaters who all play at superhuman levels in increasingly undetectable ways?

当每个在线开放大厅多人游戏都被作弊者所窒息，他们都以越来越难以察觉的方式玩超人游戏时会发生什么？

What happens when, from the perspective of the average guy, "every girl" on every dating app is a fiction driven by an AI who strings him along (including sending original and persona-consistent pictures) until it's time to scam money out of him?

当从普通人的角度来看，每个约会应用程序上的“每个女孩”都是一个由人工智能驱动的虚构故事时会发生什么，人工智能会串起他（包括发送原始和角色一致的图片）直到从他身上骗钱的时候？

What happens when, from the perspective of the average girl, "every guy" on the internet has become weirdly dismissive and hostile, because he's been conditioned to think that any girl that seems interested in him must be fake and trying to scam money out of him?

当从普通女孩的角度来看，互联网上的“每个男人”都变得古怪地不屑一顾和充满敌意时会发生什么，因为他已经习惯性地认为任何似乎对他感兴趣的女孩一定是假的，并试图从中骗钱他？

What happens when comments sections on every forum gets filled with implausibly large consensus-building hordes who are able to adapt in real time and carefully slip their brigading just below the moderator's rules?

当每个论坛的评论区都挤满了难以置信的大量建立共识的群体时，会发生什么情况？

I mean, to various degrees all this stuff is already happening. But what happens when it cranks up by an order of magnitude, seemingly overnight?

我的意思是，在不同程度上，所有这些事情都已经发生了。但是，当它似乎在一夜之间增加一个数量级时会发生什么？

What happens when most "people" you interact with on the internet are fake?

I think people start logging off.

如果您在互联网上与之互动的大多数“人”都是假的，会发生什么？ 我认为人们开始注销。

## The Great Logging Off  
伟大的注销  

Now, does this mean that everybody just turns off their computer for good, goes outside, touches grass, then joins their local Amish neighbors for a baptism and a barn raising? Maybe not.

现在，这是否意味着每个人都永远关掉电脑，走出去，接触草地，然后加入他们当地的阿米什邻居接受洗礼和建立谷仓？也许不吧。

But I do think a couple things start to happen. Many are already under way, but I think they'll accelerate.

但我确实认为有几件事开始发生。许多已经在进行中，但我认为它们会加速。

**First**, I think we see a decline in the big "open sea" social networks, replaced increasingly by fragmented silos. I don't know what will happen to Twitter, but if Elon's shenanigans cause it to fail I don't think we'll ever see anything quite like it take its place:

首先，我认为我们看到了大型“公海”社交网络的衰落，取而代之的是日益分散的孤岛。我不知道 Twitter 会发生什么，但如果 Elon 的诡计导致它失败，我认为我们永远不会看到任何类似它的东西取而代之：

**Second**, I think people will start to put a premium on accounts being "verified" as genuinely human. This can be done in two ways – just move to invite-only silos where you already know everybody, or big platforms where the owners do the vetting for you. Lots of platforms will simply take a knee-jerk reaction where they just up the amount of surveillance. "Now that there's so much bot activity, everybody need to upload their passport and driver's license, for your own safety of course!" Powerful nation states will be more than eager to assist them in this regard.

其次，我认为人们将开始重视被“验证”为真正人类的账户。这可以通过两种方式完成——只需转移到你已经认识每个人的仅限邀请的孤岛，或者转移到所有者为你进行审查的大平台。许多平台只会在增加监视量的情况下做出下意识的反应。 “现在有这么多机器人活动，每个人都需要上传他们的护照和驾照，当然是为了你自己的安全！”强大的民族国家将非常愿意在这方面提供帮助。

**Third**, private socialization will become more prized. People have been migrating to group chats and sub-forum-constellation platforms like Reddit and Discord for ages already, but the latter are still vulnerable to being flooded over time due to their relatively open nature. Private groups have the advantage that they are invitation-only, and will be of particular interest to the people put off by the increased surveillance.

第三，私人社交将变得更加珍贵。多年来，人们一直在迁移到 Reddit 和 Discord 等群聊和子论坛星座平台，但后者由于相对开放的性质，随着时间的推移仍然容易被淹没。私人团体的优势在于它们只接受邀请，并且对那些因加强监视而推迟的人特别感兴趣。

Relatedly, in the world of game design, multiplayer games that are able to deliver a good experience in small groups between trusted already known-to-be-human friends will see a particular surge in popularity (This isn't a new model, to be clear–Minecraft and Among Us are prime examples from the recent past, and co-op play is as old as dirt).

相关地，在游戏设计领域，能够在可信赖的已知人类朋友之间的小团体中提供良好体验的多人游戏将会特别流行（这不是新模型，以明确一点——Minecraft 和 Among Us 是最近的典型例子，合作游戏和泥土一样古老）。

**Fourth**, we'll see a resurgence and even fetishization of explicitly "offline" culture, where the "Great Logging Off" becomes literal. We're already seeing it in how [higher income families](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/style/digital-divide-screens-schools.html) and [techies especially](https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-execs-screen-time-children-bill-gates-steve-jobs-2019-9) greatly limit their children's screen time, and members of [Gen Y are growing wary of social media](https://piper2.bluematrix.com/docs/pdf/3bad99c6-e44a-4424-8fb1-0e3adfcbd1d4.pdf?utm_source=morning_brew&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=mb) given how much [depression and anxiety it has unleashed](https://www.aecf.org/blog/generation-z-and-mental-health) on them.

第四，我们将看到明确“离线”文化的复兴甚至迷信，其中“伟大的注销”成为字面意思。我们已经看到高收入家庭和技术人员如何极大地限制他们孩子的屏幕时间，并且 Y 世代的成员越来越警惕社交媒体，因为它给他们带来了多少抑郁和焦虑。

But to be clear, I have no idea that the "Great Logging Off" will become a _majority_ position. Because:

但要明确的是，我不知道“大注销”会成为多数派立场。因为：

**Fifth**, some people will get sucked into the online world _even super harder_.  
第五，有些人会更加沉迷于网络世界。  

Look, my original background is in video game development, and I'm kind of disquieted by how addictive and powerful modern entertainment has become. I'm willing to bet almost all of us know a young person somewhere whose life has been utterly consumed by videogames to the extent that it's hard to get them to do anything else. We've seen how refined sugar and high fructose corn syrup has devastated human health. And don't get me started on modern mass produced instant porn. Now, I'm not the kind of person to reflexively ban donuts or Call of Duty or pass sweeping obscenity laws, but I am saying that _entirely new categories of powerful addictions are available to us that weren't available to our ancestors, and it should be uncontroversial to be worried about those effects somewhat_. AI is going to let us invent even more.

你看，我原来的背景是电子游戏开发，我对现代娱乐变得如此令人上瘾和强大感到有点不安。我敢打赌，几乎我们所有人都认识某个地方的年轻人，他们的生活完全被电子游戏所消耗，以至于很难让他们做任何其他事情。我们已经看到精制糖和高果糖玉米糖浆是如何破坏人类健康的。并且不要让我开始使用现代大规模生产的即时色情。现在，我不是那种条件反射地禁止甜甜圈或使命召唤或通过全面的淫秽法律的人，但我要说的是，我们可以使用我们祖先无法获得的全新类别的强力成瘾，而且它在某种程度上担心这些影响应该没有争议。人工智能会让我们发明更多。

All that said... 说了这么多...

**Sixth,** Human civilization will survive and thrive as it always has – by evolving and adapting, both biologically and culturally. Sexual selection will cause entire swaths of the coming generations to just not reproduce due to various addictions. But that kind of "evolved resistance" to super-stimulus takes time and is pretty brutal, and culture will co-evolve on a much faster timescale. Cultures that prioritize family, community, regular face-to-face human interaction, strong social support networks, and especially those that have a built-in system for helping young people find spouses, will do better than those that don't. For instance, I don't agree with the Mormons theologically and am not planning on joining them, but I do expect them to be very successful in the coming century. Also: [the future is African](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2021/africa-cities/).

第六，人类文明将一如既往地生存和繁荣——通过生物和文化上的进化和适应。性选择将导致整个后代由于各种成瘾而无法繁殖。但这种对超级刺激的“进化抵抗”需要时间，而且相当残酷，文化将在更快的时间尺度上共同进化。优先考虑家庭、社区、定期面对面的人际互动、强大的社会支持网络的文化，尤其是那些拥有帮助年轻人寻找配偶的内置系统的文化，会比那些没有的文化做得更好。例如，我在神学上不同意摩门教，也不打算加入他们，但我确实希望他们在下个世纪非常成功。另外：未来是非洲的。

And to top it all off...  
最重要的是......  

**Seventh,** real estate prices will continue to rise. This is for two reasons – first anyone who participates in the literal version of "The Great Logging Off" will put a huge premium on face-to-face close-knit human community, creating demand for the best locations where dense housing with lots of amenities are available. Second, Ricardo's Law of Rent observes that whenever human productivity increases, those productivity gains tend to get soaked into the price of real estate in the form of rising rents. If you've read my book, _[Land is a Big Deal](https://www.landisabigdeal.com/),_ or the [freely available series of articles it's based on](https://www.gameofrent.com/), you'll know where I'm coming from.

第七，房地产价格将继续上涨。这有两个原因——首先，任何参与“伟大的注销”的真实版本的人都会非常重视面对面的紧密联系的人类社区，从而创造对最佳地点的需求，那里的密集住房有很多便利设施一应俱全。其次，李嘉图的租金定律观察到，每当人类生产力提高时，这些生产力的提高往往会以租金上涨的形式被吸收到房地产价格中。如果您读过我的书 Land is a Big Deal 或它所基于的免费系列文章，您就会知道我的观点。

## Ways I Could be Wrong About This  
我可能会错的方式  

It's easy to make a series of predictions sound compelling by just being _super specific_, which gives off the veneer of a time traveler who has seen it all happen. To be honest I have no idea if the above will come to pass, it just happens to fit together logically. But it does depend on several assumptions:

仅仅通过非常具体就可以很容易地使一系列的预测听起来令人信服，这会散发出一个看到这一切发生的时间旅行者的虚饰。老实说，我不知道以上是否会发生，它只是在逻辑上恰好组合在一起。但它确实取决于几个假设：

**First,** that existing ChatGPT-style tech will scale and get cheaper. Before it was used for crypto, [Proof of Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) was designed as an anti-spam mitigation technique. If it costs $0.01 to send an email, that doesn't really hinder a regular user, but it will make someone think twice before blasting out a million of those. [Word on the street](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/chatgpt-interesting-things-to-know-8334991/) is each ChatGPT chat costs on the order of a few cents right now.

首先，现有的 ChatGPT 式技术将扩展并变得更便宜。在用于加密之前，工作量证明被设计为一种反垃圾邮件缓解技术。如果发送一封电子邮件的费用为 0.01 美元，这并不会真正妨碍普通用户，但它会让某人在发出一百万封电子邮件之前三思而后行。街上的消息是，现在每个 ChatGPT 聊天的费用大约为几美分。

**Second,** that people deep down crave personal human-to-human contact and interaction to be fulfilled, happy, healthy, and sane long-term. (As well as reproductively successful, both biologically and culturally)

其次，人们内心深处渴望人与人之间的接触和互动能够长期得到满足、快乐、健康和理智。 （以及在生物学和文化上的繁殖成功）

**Third,** that AI technologies won't be perfect substitutes for actual human-to-human contact.

第三，人工智能技术不会完美替代实际的人与人之间的接触。

**Fourth,** a bunch of stuff I didn't even consider. What did I miss? Place your bets here:

第四，一堆我什至没有考虑的东西。我错过了什么？在这里下注：
