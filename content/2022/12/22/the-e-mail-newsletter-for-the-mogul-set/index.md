When the digital-media company Puck launched, last September, it promised insider access from “elite, genre-defining journalists” to America’s centers of power—Hollywood, Wall Street, Washington, and Silicon Valley. In an accompanying manifesto, Jon Kelly, its editor-in-chief and co-founder, laid out Puck’s editorial strategy and business model, which aimed to place its writers at the heart of the project, as owners of the company. Other industries had remade themselves around new “distribution streams” and the “creator economy” and, in Kelly’s estimation, “journalists, perhaps the original influencers, were due for the same transformation.” He cast Puck writers as “generationally talented,” peers of the most exalted industry leaders they were covering. What he had learned in nearly two decades as an editor—largely at _Vanity Fair_, with stints at Bloomberg Businessweek and at the _Times Magazine_—Kelly told me, “was just how much these élite journalists knew.” Yet much of their knowledge never made it to readers. Puck was designed to change that. It was built to reveal the backstory, to take readers into back rooms, and to display the back-scratching that takes place within them.

当数字媒体公司 Puck 于去年 9 月成立时，它承诺允许“定义流派的精英记者”进入美国的权力中心——好莱坞、华尔街、华盛顿和硅谷。在随附的宣言中，其主编兼联合创始人乔恩·凯利 (Jon Kelly) 阐述了 Puck 的编辑策略和商业模式，旨在将其作者作为公司所有者置于项目的核心。其他行业围绕着新的“发行流”和“创作者经济”重塑了自己，据凯利估计，“记者，也许是最初的影响者，也应该进行同样的转变。”他将 Puck 作家描述为“世代相传的天才”，他们所报道的最崇高的行业领导者的同行。凯利告诉我，他在将近 20 年的编辑生涯中学到的东西——主要是在《名利场》杂志，也曾在《彭博商业周刊》和《时代周刊》任职——“就是这些精英记者知道多少。”然而，他们的大部分知识从未被读者所接受。 Puck 旨在改变这一点。它的建立是为了揭示背景故事，将读者带入密室，并展示发生在其中的幕后故事。

Puck sought to capitalize on the same idea driving [the newsletter company Substack](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/04/is-substack-the-media-future-we-want)—that certain writers, with dedicated followings, can be their own profit centers. Puck’s writers would be featured in their own newsletters (or “private e-mails,” as Kelly likes to say), but also enjoy the scaffolding of copy-editing and story meetings. Their compensation model was at the core of Puck’s strategy. At Puck, journalists weren’t simply salaried employees. They would get an equity stake in the company and receive bonuses based on their subscriber numbers. (For every thousand subscribers they bring in, writers get ten thousand dollars.) Puck journalists, some of whom earn between three hundred thousand and four hundred thousand dollars a year, refer to one another as “partners” and receive detailed briefings on the state of the business—an unusual arrangement in media, where writers typically have only a dim awareness of company balance sheets.

Puck 试图利用推动时事通讯公司 Substack 的相同想法——某些拥有忠实追随者的作家可以成为他们自己的利润中心。 Puck 的作家将出现在他们自己的时事通讯（或凯利喜欢说的“私人电子邮件”）中，但也享受文案编辑和故事会议的脚手架。他们的薪酬模式是 Puck 战略的核心。在帕克，记者不仅仅是领薪水的雇员。他们将获得公司的股权，并根据他们的订户数量获得奖金。 （他们每带来 1000 名订阅者，作家就能得到一万美元。）冰球记者，其中一些年收入在 30 万到 40 万美元之间，互相称呼为“合作伙伴”，并收到有关该州的详细简报业务——媒体中的一种不寻常的安排，作家通常对公司的资产负债表只有模糊的认识。

Puck’s tone is deliberately clubby. Part of its pitch is that its writers move in the same elevated spaces as the people whom they cover. Kelly dislikes some of the “wrist-slapping and rage in journalism” nowadays and seems put off by the effects of the democratizing forces of social media on the profession. (In one conversation, he told me that he thought sending Twitter D.M.s was “a little tacky.”) His site is meant to be more understanding of the complex problems that face the masters of the universe. Puck, Kelly said, has a “pro-success” attitude.

Puck 的语气是故意的。它的部分宣传是它的作者和他们所报道的人在同一个高处移动。凯利不喜欢如今“新闻界的一些拍手和愤怒”，似乎对社交媒体的民主化力量对该行业的影响感到厌恶。 （在一次谈话中，他告诉我他认为发送 Twitter D.M.s“有点俗气。”）他的网站旨在更好地了解宇宙主人面临的复杂问题。凯利说，帕克有一种“支持成功”的态度。

It ostensibly expects the same of its readers. Puck makes no attempt to conceal its yearning for a rarefied audience. When subscribing—a hundred dollars for basic yearly access, two hundred and fifty to be a member of the “Inner Circle,” which includes off-the-record conference calls with the writers themselves—you’re asked to identify your job level. C-suite, senior director, senior executive, and director are four of the seven Puck-sanctioned reader careers. I sheepishly checked “other.” Jen Psaki, Hank Paulson, Kara Swisher, and Sheryl Sandberg are all readers. One slide from the site’s pitch deck to potential advertisers features a pyramid under the banner “Puck’s audience is comprised of the most influential people in America.” The top of the pyramid is labelled Titans of Industry; the middle, Aspiring; and the bottom, Everyone Else.

它表面上期望它的读者也一样。 Puck 毫不掩饰它对稀有观众的渴望。订阅时——基本年度访问费用为 100 美元，成为“Inner Circle”成员的费用为 250 美元，其中包括与作家本人的非正式电话会议——你需要确定你的工作级别。 C-suite、高级主管、高级管理人员和主管是 Puck 认可的七个读者职业中的四个。我不好意思地勾选了“其他”。 Jen Psaki、Hank Paulson、Kara Swisher 和 Sheryl Sandberg 都是读者。从该网站的宣传板到潜在广告商的一张幻灯片在“帕克的观众由美国最有影响力的人组成”的横幅下展示了一个金字塔。金字塔的顶端被标记为工业巨头；中间，有抱负；和底部，其他人。

Among the site’s fixations so far have been the Warner Bros. Discovery C.E.O., David Zaslav (“Zaz” in Puck-speak; his domain is “Zazworld”), and headlines with “Tao” in them: “The Tao of Ari’s Abs”; “The Tao of Chuck Todd”; “The Tao of Gary”; “The Tao of Paramount.” “Ari” as in the Endeavor C.E.O., Ari Emanuel, and “Gary” as in the former Goldman Sachs president and C.O.O. and Trump economic adviser, Gary Cohn. The site’s top drivers of traffic—Matthew Belloni (who has the most subscribers), Dylan Byers, and Julia Ioffe—have all benefitted from major events that unfolded around the time of Puck’s launch. Belloni, a former entertainment lawyer and editor of the _Hollywood Reporter_, has focussed his efforts on the entertainment industry’s post-pandemic flux. (Twenty-five per cent of Puck’s audience is in the entertainment business, twenty per cent is in media, and ten per cent is in tech.) “People are anxiety-ridden,” Belloni told me. “They want to read about what’s going on.” Writing what Puck calls “Sun Valley—the e-mail list” is Byers, a former CNN reporter who has covered the concentric scandals that emanated from the departure of the network’s president, Jeff Zucker, and the merger of its parent company, WarnerMedia, with Discovery. (Kelly once called chatter about the cable-news network “a love language.”) Ioffe, a Moscow-born writer on Russian affairs, was hired to report on Washington, from the vantage point of a foreign correspondent. She has built up a large audience with her coverage of the war in Ukraine, writing about the mood and morale in Russia, Putin’s psychology, and the alliances and entanglements the war has brought. Her Puck readership is particularly connected, Ioffe said. “I would hear stuff about how people in the C.I.A. were reading me.”

到目前为止，该网站的关注者包括华纳兄弟探索频道的首席执行官 David Zaslav（帕克语中的“Zaz”；他的域名是“Zazworld”），以及带有“Tao”的标题：“The Tao of Ari's Abs” ; “查克·托德之道”； “加里之道”； “至高无上的道。” “Ari”代表 Endeavour C.E.O.、Ari Emanuel，“Gary”代表前高盛总裁兼 C.O.O.和特朗普的经济顾问加里科恩。该网站的主要流量推动者——Matthew Belloni（拥有最多订阅者）、Dylan Byers 和 Julia Ioffe——都受益于 Puck 推出前后发生的重大事件。 Belloni 是前娱乐业律师和 Hollywood Reporter 的编辑，他将精力集中在娱乐业的大流行后变化上。 （帕克 25% 的观众来自娱乐行业，20% 来自媒体，10% 来自科技。）“人们充满了焦虑，”贝洛尼告诉我。 “他们想了解正在发生的事情。”撰写帕克所谓的“太阳谷——电子邮件列表”的是拜尔斯，他是美国有线电视新闻网的前记者，曾报道过因该网络总裁杰夫扎克离职及其母公司华纳媒体合并而引发的同心丑闻，与发现。 （凯利曾将关于有线电视新闻网络的闲聊称为“一种爱的语言”。）约菲是一位出生于莫斯科的俄罗斯事务作家，受聘从外国记者的角度报道华盛顿。她对乌克兰战争的报道赢得了大批观众，她撰写了有关俄罗斯的情绪和士气、普京的心理以及战争带来的联盟和纠葛的文章。 Ioffe 说，她的 Puck 读者群特别有联系。 “我会听到有关 C.I.A. 的人如何。在读我。”

The Puck style is authoritative and knowing. Its writers regularly refer to the moguls they cover by their first names. Their dispatches often have bits of news, but they’re also distilling the yammering going on in their specific coverage worlds. A common Puck trope is to speak of one’s phone and e-mail blowing up with sources clamoring to talk. William D. Cohan, a former mergers-and-acquisition banker—who once wrote about the “private equity prom” he flew from his home in Nantucket to attend—unpacks Wall Street deals in prose laden with _EBITDA_, debt-restructuring, and pearls about how the activist investor Dan Loeb “lives large (but tastefully).” The site’s politics coverage often channels the perspective of a consultant or staffer class, chronicling who’s up, who’s down, and who’s the next big figure to snipe about. Puck aims to be chatty and confiding, the conspiratorial companion to the _Times’_ or the _Journal’s_ business section. In one edition of his own Saturday newsletter, Kelly wrote, “At Puck, we’re not shy about the fact that we often know the people we cover, and we happily eschew some of the stuffier conventions of journalism, like inserting banal and hollow on-the-record quotes just to prove we dropped a call, or marble-mouthed bothsidesism, or vacant euphemisms.”

帕克风格是权威和了解的。它的作者经常用他们的名字提到他们所涵盖的大亨。他们的新闻报道经常有一些新闻，但他们也在提炼他们特定报道领域中发生的抱怨。一个常见的 Puck 比喻是谈论一个人的电话和电子邮件，消息来源吵着要谈话。前并购银行家威廉·D·科汉 (William D. Cohan) 曾经写过他从楠塔基特 (Nantucket) 的家中飞来参加的“私募股权舞会”——用散文讲述了华尔街的交易，其中充斥着息税折旧摊销前利润、债务重组和珍珠关于激进投资者丹·勒布 (Dan Loeb) 如何“过着奢侈（但有品位）的生活”。该网站的政治报道通常会引导顾问或员工阶层的观点，记录谁在上升，谁在下降，以及谁是下一个要狙击的大人物。帕克的目标是健谈和倾诉，是《纽约时报》或《华尔街日报》商业版块的阴谋伴侣。在他自己的周六时事通讯的一个版本中，凯利写道，“在帕克，我们并不羞于承认我们经常认识我们报道的人，我们很高兴地避开了新闻业的一些沉闷的惯例，比如插入平庸和空洞的记录在案的引述只是为了证明我们放弃了一个电话，或者是口无遮拦的双方主义，或者是空洞的委婉语。”

The site often succeeds at capturing an insider’s perspective; some of the outlet’s subscribers told me that they can often guess the anonymous sourcing behind any given piece of coverage. “It’s a pretty sophisticated readership,” an entertainment executive told me. “Some people obviously are using them to deliver different messages, but that’s O.K.” He pointed to Byers’s coverage of Zucker’s firing from CNN. “I would just always chuckle because I could see who was speaking, but everybody kind of knows that. It’s almost kind of amusing to watch it play out.”

该网站经常成功地捕捉到内部人士的观点；该媒体的一些订户告诉我，他们经常可以猜出任何给定报道背后的匿名来源。 “这是一个相当老练的读者群，”一位娱乐业高管告诉我。 “有些人显然在用它们传递不同的信息，但这没关系。”他指出拜尔斯对 CNN 解雇祖克的报道。 “我总是会咯咯地笑，因为我可以看到谁在说话，但每个人都知道这一点。看着它上演几乎有点有趣。”

But Puck can also be guilty of overreach. Its promotional copy sometimes reads like they’re breaking the story of the moment—“[Bill Cohan reveals what Dan Loeb wants from Disney](https://puck.news/dan-loebs-chapek-punch-list)” or “[Matt Belloni reveals when the Disney board turned on Chapek](https://puck.news/the-iger-shocker/)”—when, in fact, they’re merely delivering what amounts to an explainer about it. “The Twitter saga is indubitably one of the stories of our time: a battle of egos, lawyers, dealmakers, accountants, rich hangers-on,” Kelly wrote in one Saturday newsletter. “It’s precisely the sort of tale you can only find at Puck.” Of course, the saga of Elon Musk and Twitter can be found in literally any major news outlet.

但 Puck 也可能犯了过度扩张的罪。它的宣传文案有时读起来好像他们正在打破当下的故事——“比尔科汉透露丹勒布想从迪士尼那里得到什么”或“马特贝洛尼透露迪士尼董事会何时转向查佩克”——而事实上，他们只是提供有关它的解释器。 “推特传奇无疑是我们这个时代的故事之一：一场自负、律师、交易撮合者、会计师、有钱人的斗争，”凯利在周六的一份时事通讯中写道。 “这正是你只能在 Puck 找到的那种故事。”当然，Elon Musk 和 Twitter 的故事几乎可以在任何主要新闻媒体中找到。

“I think they’ve done a very good job of carving out a voice that doesn’t exist anywhere else,” Felix Salmon, the chief financial correspondent at a competing site, Axios, said. “Puck is really tacking hard into the insidery thing: ‘We are going to give you all of those juicy, gossipy, inside details that you didn’t know that you wanted.’ ” The concern, he went on, is that the reporting doesn’t always live up to hype. “You realize once you subscribe, it’s a bit like going into a V.I.P. room at a club. You’re, like, ‘Wait, after all that effort I ended up in here?’ ”

“我认为他们在发出其他任何地方都不存在的声音方面做得非常好，”竞争网站 Axios 的首席财经记者菲利克斯萨尔蒙说。 “Puck 真的很努力地处理内部事务：‘我们将为您提供所有那些您不知道自己想要的多汁、八卦的内部细节。’”他继续说道，令人担忧的是，报告并不总是辜负炒作。 “一旦订阅，你就会意识到，这有点像进入 V.I.P.俱乐部的房间。你就像，‘等等，经过所有的努力，我最终还是来到了这里？’”

A decade ago, media startups single-mindedly chased clicks to drive advertising revenue. Puck is just one of a flotilla of new digital publications targeting specific subsets of readers—Punchbowl (Capitol Hill) and the Ankler (Hollywood) have adopted similar strategies. Puck stands out because it’s not squeamish in declaring its fixation on the rich and powerful. “Élite journalists are our influencers,” Kelly said. “And there is a chance to arbitrage the confluence of their influence and their opportunities.”

十年前，媒体初创公司一心一意地追逐点击以增加广告收入。 Puck 只是针对特定读者群的新型数字出版物中的一员——Punchbowl（国会山）和 Ankler（好莱坞）采用了类似的策略。 Puck 之所以脱颖而出，是因为它毫不吝啬地宣称自己对有钱有势的人很着迷。 “精英记者是我们的影响者，”凯利说。 “并且有机会套利他们的影响力和机会的汇合点。”

Kelly is forty, blue-eyed, and tan, with the compact frame of a suburban dad who never snacks from his kids’ plates. He lives in Montclair, New Jersey—“the idea that I live in New Jersey is still something I’m coming to terms with,” Kelly told me—and drives a Volvo. Many people who know him described him as impish or mischievous, with a sense of humor that went just up to the line and often over it. But Kelly was invariably disciplined during our conversations, even the off-the-record chats. One of Kelly’s skills is calibration, a former colleague told me. “He’s a very good salesman, and he knows who he’s selling to.” Another said, “He knows people. I think that’s part of his job—to know exactly how he needs to act.”

凯利 40 岁，蓝眼睛，皮肤黝黑，有着郊区父亲的紧凑身材，从不吃孩子盘子里的零食。他住在新泽西州的蒙特克莱尔——“我仍然接受住在新泽西的想法，”凯利告诉我——开着一辆沃尔沃。许多认识他的人都形容他顽皮或调皮，幽默感恰到好处，而且常常过分。但凯利在我们的谈话中总是受到纪律处分，即使是非正式的谈话。一位前同事告诉我，凯利的一项技能是校准。 “他是一个非常好的推销员，他知道他要卖给谁。”另一个说：“他认识人。我认为这是他工作的一部分——确切地知道他需要如何行动。”

The seed of what would become Puck was planted at a desk outside Graydon Carter’s office when Carter was the editor of _Vanity Fair_. Carter himself sat behind an immense, custom-made beechwood desk shaped like a semicircle—which would later be used in an episode of “[Succession](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/11/08/is-succession-the-best-sitcom-on-television).” Kelly, the son of the author John Kelly and Sheila Weller, a longtime _Vanity Fair_ contributor, had grown up on Jane Street, in the West Village, which then “ascribed to a set of values”—bohemian, individualistic, exclusive—“that I still hold on to,” Kelly said. In middle school, he started reading the New York _Observer_, and later in his teen-age years, _Spy_ magazine, the irreverent publication of culture, politics, and power that Carter co-founded in the mid-eighties. He went on to graduate from Fieldston, where he played football and baseball—“I wasn’t literary, I was a jock,” he told me—and Columbia University. “Every essay I wrote from seventh grade to my second year of college would go through a conceptual edit with my dad, and then my mother would sit at the computer with me and line-edit,” Kelly said. But he didn’t come from big-time money, at least compared with many of his Fieldston classmates. “I had a bit of Mr. Inside–Mr. Outside,” Kelly said. “I—at a very, very early age—normalized, like, ‘Oh, let me putter around my friend’s fourteen-bedroom Park Avenue apartment.’ ”

当卡特担任《名利场》的编辑时，他在格雷登·卡特办公室外的一张桌子上种下了后来成为帕克的种子。卡特自己坐在一张巨大的、定制的、形状像半圆形的山毛榉木桌子后面——这张桌子后来被用在了“继承”的一集中。凯利是作家约翰·凯利 (John Kelly) 和《名利场》(Vanity Fair) 的长期撰稿人希拉·韦勒 (Sheila Weller) 的儿子，在西村的简街长大，那里“被赋予了一套价值观”——放荡不羁、个人主义、排他性——“我仍然坚持，”凯利说。中学时，他开始阅读《纽约观察家报》，后来在他十几岁的时候，阅读了《间谍》杂志，这是卡特在 80 年代中期与他人共同创立的一本关于文化、政治和权力的不敬刊物。他继续从 Fieldston 毕业，在那里他踢足球和棒球——“我不是文学，我是一名运动员，”他告诉我——和哥伦比亚大学。 “从七年级到大学二年级，我写的每一篇文章都会和我爸爸一起进行概念编辑，然后我妈妈会和我一起坐在电脑前进行行编辑，”凯利说。但他并不是出身富豪，至少与他在菲尔斯顿的许多同学相比是这样。 “我有点像 Inside-Mr。在外面，”凯利说。 “我——在非常非常小的时候——正常化了，就像，‘哦，让我在我朋友位于公园大道的十四间卧室的公寓里闲逛。’”

Kelly became Carter’s assistant, in 2004, at the age of twenty-one, and eventually assumed a certain status at the magazine as Carter’s mini-me. Kelly described other employees’ view of him as “He may be a kid, but you have to give him what he’s asking for—he’s Graydon’s guy.” This dynamic did not always endear him to co-workers.

2004 年，21 岁的凯利成为卡特的助手，并最终在杂志社获得了一定的地位，成为卡特的迷你版。凯利将其他员工对他的看法描述为“他可能是个孩子，但你必须满足他的要求——他是格雷登的人。”这种动态并不总是让他受到同事的喜爱。

Kelly carried Carter’s briefcase; ran errands in Venice; attended lots of parties; took V.I.P. reservations for the Waverly Inn, Carter’s Greenwich Village restaurant; and generally soaked up what he calls “the magazine arts.” He and Carter clicked in a familiar way. One of Kelly’s former colleagues at _Vanity Fair_ said, “Graydon is like the prototypical boarding-school teacher who loves the rapscallion, the kid who stirs the shit.” The other former staffer said, “Especially as a man, working for a man, they had a real shorthand.” At a certain point, the former staffer went on, Kelly started to sound like Carter. “Some of the turns of phrases or the way Graydon would sign off his cards,” they said. “ ‘Hey, kiddo, good work.’ Like he was the boss.”

凯利提着卡特的公文包；在威尼斯跑腿；参加了很多聚会；拿了V.I.P.预订 Carter’s Greenwich Village 餐厅 Waverly Inn；并且通常沉浸在他所谓的“杂志艺术”中。他和卡特以一种熟悉的方式点击。凯利在《名利场》的一位前同事说：“格雷登就像典型的寄宿学校老师，喜欢捣蛋鬼，喜欢搅屎的孩子。”另一位前员工说，“特别是作为一个男人，为一个男人工作，他们有一个真正的速记。”在某个时刻，这位前职员继续说道，凯利开始听起来像卡特。 “一些短语的变化或格雷登在他的卡片上签名的方式，”他们说。 “‘嘿，孩子，干得好。’就像他是老板一样。”

A contributor photograph from the June, 2007, issue captures Kelly in that era, looking like the Chuck Bass character in “Gossip Girl” in a crew-neck sweater and collared shirt, the shadow of a smirk playing across his face. A brief bio notes his “lineage” as Weller’s son and adds, “He’s considered changing his name to ‘Graydon Carter’s office.’ ”

2007 年 6 月刊的一张照片捕捉到了那个时代的凯利，他穿着圆领毛衣和有领衬衫，看起来就像《绯闻女孩》中的查克·巴斯角色，脸上挂着假笑的影子。一份简短的简历记录了他作为 Weller 儿子的“血统”，并补充说，“他考虑将自己的名字改为‘Graydon Carter 的办公室’。”

In 2010, Kelly left _Vanity Fair_ for Bloomberg Businessweek, where he edited its life-style section. Carter was livid. Kelly recalls him saying, “ ‘You’ve got to be fucking kidding me. Why would you leave the Yankees to play for the Blue Jays?’ ” They didn’t speak for years. “In the small crucible of that world, it was stunning that I would leave—I was the Tom Hagen person in his life,” Kelly said, referring to the consigliere character in the “Godfather” movies, played by Robert Duvall. Kelly said that he’d made up his mind to depart after a 2009 _Vanity Fair_ staff retreat at the Carlyle Hotel, not long after the financial crash. The requirement had been to bring one big idea, and his, he said, was to “promote the print articles on the Internet.” The room seemed to hate it, and Kelly, who saw himself as more digitally oriented, soon realized that it was time to go.

2010 年，凯利离开《名利场》前往彭博商业周刊，担任其生活方式版块的编辑。卡特勃然大怒。凯利回忆他说：“‘你他妈的一定是在跟我开玩笑。你为什么要离开洋基队为蓝鸟队效力？’”他们多年没有说话。 “在那个世界的小熔炉里，我离开真是太棒了——我是汤姆·哈根生命中的那个人，”凯利说，他指的是罗伯特·杜瓦尔 (Robert Duvall) 饰演的《教父》电影中的参谋角色。凯利说，他在 2009 年金融危机后不久在凯雷酒店举行的名利场员工务虚会后就下定决心离开。要求是提出一个大创意，他说，他的要求是“在互联网上推广印刷文章”。这个房间似乎很讨厌它，而认为自己更倾向于数字化的凯利很快意识到是时候离开了。

After Bloomberg, he spent three years as an editor at the _Times Magazine_, where, amid the meetings and frenzied closes, Kelly had something of an epiphany: “Oh, my God, am I gonna do this every week for the rest of my life?” In 2015, he returned to _Vanity Fair_, where he took over the title’s digital-news vertical, later named the Hive. Some members of _Vanity Fair’s_ editorial staff who resented Kelly from his first stint at the magazine resisted his return, two of them said. Carter met with staffers to issue reassurances and days later announced Kelly’s hiring.

离开布隆伯格之后，他在时代杂志担任了三年的编辑，在会议和疯狂的闭幕式中，凯利突然顿悟：“哦，天哪，我会在余生中每周都这样做吗？ ？ 2015 年，他回到名利场，接管了标题的数字新闻垂直，后来命名为 Hive。其中两人表示，《名利场》的一些编辑人员从凯利第一次在该杂志工作就对他不满，他们拒绝让他回来。卡特与工作人员会面以做出保证，几天后宣布聘用凯利。

When Carter left _Vanity Fair_, in 2017, Kelly stayed on under the new editor, Radhika Jones. His ambition had started to grow. Kelly had heard that Adam Mendelsohn, a communications executive who helped advise LeBron James on the launch of his SpringHill production company, was scouting for potential media investments for TPG. Kelly decided to reach out to him. “I was the aggressor in that situation,” Kelly told me. They arranged to meet in Los Angeles. “We went to one of those overpriced sushi places in a strip mall and just really saw eye to eye about what was changing, and the opportunity in giving journalists tools they needed for this new distribution era,” Kelly said. Mendelsohn, who is now a member of Puck’s board of directors, introduced Kelly to James Coulter, the co-founder of TPG, a private-equity firm with a hundred and thirty-five billion dollars in assets. Around that time, the firm was exploring the idea of purchasing _Vanity Fair_ from Condé Nast or partnering with it on a digital venture. (Condé Nast, which also owns _The New Yorker_, _Vogue_, and many other titles, passed on those ideas.)

当卡特于 2017 年离开《名利场》时，凯利继续在新编辑拉迪卡·琼斯手下工作。他的野心开始膨胀。凯利听说 Adam Mendelsohn 是一位公关主管，他曾在勒布朗·詹姆斯 (LeBron James) 的 SpringHill 制作公司成立时为他提供建议，他正在为 TPG 寻找潜在的媒体投资。凯利决定联系他。 “在那种情况下，我是侵略者，”凯利告诉我。他们约好在洛杉矶见面。 “我们去了一个露天购物中心里价格过高的寿司店之一，真的看到了正在发生的变化，以及为记者提供他们在这个新的发行时代所需的工具的机会，”凯利说。 Mendelsohn 现在是 Puck 的董事会成员，他将 Kelly 介绍给了 TPG 的联合创始人 James Coulter，TPG 是一家拥有 1350 亿美元资产的私募股权公司。大约在那个时候，该公司正在探索从康泰纳仕手中收购《名利场》或与其合作开展数字业务的想法。 （同时拥有《纽约客》、《Vogue》和许多其他杂志的康泰纳仕集团继承了这些想法。）

By then, some inside Condé Nast recalled, Kelly seemed to regularly inflate the importance of his role. Anna Wintour, the editor of _Vogue_ and Condé Nast’s chief content officer, held periodic meetings for the company’s editors, across print and digital. A person outside _Vanity Fair_ who attended those meetings said, “My recollection is he would always introduce himself as, ‘I’m Jon Kelly, the editor of the Hive at _Vanity Fair_,” as if it were its own publication.

那时，康泰纳仕的一些内部人士回忆说，凯利似乎经常夸大自己角色的重要性。 Vogue 的编辑兼康泰纳仕的首席内容官 Anna Wintour 定期为公司的印刷和数字编辑举行会议。参加这些会议的名利场之外的一位人士说：“我的记忆是，他总是自我介绍，‘我是名利场 Hive 的编辑 Jon Kelly’，就好像它是自己的出版物一样。

Jones faced criticism during her first years at the magazine, including from inside the company. [_New York_ magazine](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/10/conde-nast-anna-wintour-roger-lynch.html) and the [_Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/13/business/media/conde-nast-racial.html) both reported that people on the business side at Condé Nast chafed at Jones’s covers, many of which featured people of color and up-and-coming, lesser-known stars. Kelly said that a senior Condé executive pressed him to approach Wintour for a meeting about the editor-in-chief job. In a surprise move, Wintour asked Jones to join them. The meeting was brief; the three editors talked about politics, not the position.

琼斯在该杂志的头几年面临批评，包括来自公司内部的批评。 《纽约》杂志和《泰晤士报》都报道说，康泰纳仕集团的业务人员对琼斯的封面感到不满，其中许多封面都是有色人种和崭露头角的鲜为人知的明星。凯利说，康泰的一位高级管理人员敦促他与温图尔就主编的工作进行会面。出乎意料的是，温图尔邀请琼斯加入他们。会议很简短。三位编辑谈的是政治，不是立场。

Kelly told me that, by the time of the meeting, he was already intent on leaving. He became an adviser to TPG, working with the company on media investments and acquiring what he called “a mid-career M.B.A.” (He sprinkles business terms into conversations with the zeal of a convert—“you know, we’re an A.R.P.U. business,” he told me at one point.) Kelly met two of his co-founders, Max Tcheyan and Joe Purzycki, formerly of The Athletic and Luminary, respectively, through the firm’s match-making. The C.O.O. and co-founder Liz Gough joined on from Condé Nast. TPG is now one of the funders of Puck, along with the investment arm of Standard Industries, “the world’s largest roofing and waterproofing company,” which employs a number of former _Vanity Fair_ staffers. “The vibe of the office feels like _Vanity Fair_,” Kelly told me, of Standard. “It’s beautiful; people are sharp and sophisticated. It’s just classy.”

凯利告诉我，在会议召开时，他已经打算离开了。他成为 TPG 的顾问，与该公司合作进行媒体投资，并获得了他所谓的“职业生涯中期 M.B.A”。 （他以皈依者的热情在谈话中加入商业术语——“你知道，我们是一家 A.R.P.U. 企业，”他有一次告诉我。）凯利会见了他的两位联合创始人，Max Tcheyan 和 Joe Purzycki，以前The Athletic 和 Luminary 分别通过公司的牵线搭桥。 C.O.O.和联合创始人 Liz Gough 从 Condé Nast 加入。 TPG 现在是 Puck 的资助者之一，同时也是标准工业的投资部门，“世界上最大的屋顶和防水公司”，它雇用了许多前名利场员工。 “办公室的氛围感觉就像名利场，”凯利告诉我，标准。 “真漂亮;人们敏锐而老练。这只是优雅。”

TPG and Standard also fund Carter’s “Air Mail”—a mix of culture writing, reported features, and high-end fashion and beauty coverage—though Carter and Kelly both went out of their way to quash the idea that Carter was responsible for getting Kelly in the door with TPG. Or that he shadow-edits Puck. Carter did come up with the site’s name, though. The Puck Building, which is now owned by the Kushner family’s company, is where Carter’s _Spy_ magazine was originally housed. And Puck’s automated e-mail persona, Fritz, was also the name of the Waverly Inn’s reservation bot.

TPG 和 Standard 还资助了卡特的“航空邮报”——融合了文化写作、专题报道、高端时尚和美容报道——尽管卡特和凯利都竭力驳斥卡特要为凯利负责的说法在TPG的门上。或者说他对 Puck 进行了影子编辑。不过，卡特确实想出了网站的名字。现在归库什纳家族公司所有的帕克大厦是卡特的间谍杂志最初的所在地。 Puck 的自动电子邮件角色 Fritz 也是 Waverly Inn 预订机器人的名字。

Carter and Kelly’s relationship is complex—a teetering mille-feuille of ego and affection. People pointed me to Kelly’s remarks at an editor’s memorial service in 2021 as an example of their dynamic. Carter couldn’t attend the service but enlisted Kelly to read something he’d written. “I wanted to say a few words myself,” Kelly says, in a video of the service that can be found online. “First, as always, Graydon.”

卡特和凯利的关系很复杂——自我和感情摇摇欲坠的千层酥。人们向我指出了凯利在 2021 年编辑追悼会上的讲话，以此作为他们动态的一个例子。卡特无法参加葬礼，但请凯利阅读他写的东西。 “我想自己说几句话，”凯利在一段可以在网上找到的服务视频中说。 “首先，一如既往，格雷登。”

Kelly appeared perturbed when I commented that his years at _Vanity Fair_ seemed to loom large. “Maybe more to you—I mean, I love _Vanity Fair_,” he said. “I wanted to do my own thing.” But when Kelly offered a vision for his career, he couldn’t help but mention Carter. “I always thought that I was trying to be an ersatz version of my media heroes,” he said, “like Graydon, Bill Simmons, and, no joke, Kris Jenner.” To Kelly, each of them has what he called an innate ability to identify talent and to “take advantage of their superpowers.”

当我评论说他在《名利场》的岁月似乎显得很重要时，凯利显得很不安。 “也许对你来说更重要——我的意思是，我喜欢名利场，”他说。 “我想做我自己的事。”但当凯利提出他的职业愿景时，他忍不住提到了卡特。 “我一直认为我正在努力成为我的媒体英雄的代用版本，”他说，“就像格雷登、比尔西蒙斯，还有，不是开玩笑，克里斯詹纳。”对凯利来说，他们每个人都有他所说的识别人才和“利用他们的超能力”的天生能力。

Every Saturday, Kelly publishes a newsletter called “The Backstory,” in which he waxes on about his conversations with a “real media player, one of those true battle axes who seem to have invisible fingerprints on almost everything”; an “informal lunch with a legendary editor . . . in the pedigree of Leo Lerman, Wallace \[sic\] Shawn, Graydon Carter, Sonny Mehta, Grace Mirabella, Bob Gottlieb, Anna Wintour, Art Cooper, and Tina Brown”; “kibitzing . . . with a legendary journalist in a green room at the One Hotel, overlooking the East River toward Manhattan, right in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge.” The writing isn’t just peppered with blind items; it ostentatiously name-drops as well. Tina Nguyen, a politics writer at Puck, said, “I’ve made fun of him for his newsletter style for years. It’s embarrassing.”

每个星期六，凯利都会发布一份名为“幕后故事”的时事通讯，在其中他会大谈自己与“真正的媒体播放器，真正的战斧之一，几乎在所有东西上都有看不见的指纹”； “与传奇编辑的非正式午餐”。 . .在 Leo Lerman、Wallace \[sic\] Shawn、Graydon Carter、Sonny Mehta、Grace Mirabella、Bob Gottlieb、Anna Wintour、Art Cooper 和 Tina Brown 的血统中； “kibitzing。 . .一位传奇记者在 One Hotel 的绿色房间里，俯瞰东河向曼哈顿的方向，就在布鲁克林大桥的阴影下。”文字不仅充满了盲目的东西；它也很炫耀地掉名字。帕克 (Puck) 的政治作家蒂娜·阮 (Tina Nguyen) 说：“多年来，我一直取笑他的时事通讯风格。这让人很难堪。”

Kelly’s current and former writers pretty much all expressed affection for him. “He seems timeless to me,” Cohan said. Byers told me that Kelly possesses the leadership qualities of the Axios co-founder Jim VandeHei and Zucker, the former CNN boss, particularly “making people feel really good and confident about themselves.” Part of his pitch to reporters was that they could write how they wanted to, or hadn’t been allowed to, at their previous employers. “I think Jon is interested in stories that are genuinely interesting,” the reporter Teddy Schleifer, who covers Silicon Valley billionaires for Puck, said. “As a consumer of news, so much stuff these days is just boring.” As an editor, Kelly can push limits. One reporter, who has worked with Kelly and likes him, told me that he was always pushing to publish, even if the reporter didn’t think that they had the on-the-record goods. “His real pitch is ‘what you really want to know is what people are going to tell you off the record.’ ” Tara Palmeri, who covers politics for Puck, said that Kelly’s mischievousness was one of the reasons she was eager to work with him. “I think he gets what gets attention and what gets people interested,” she said.

凯利的现任和前任作家几乎都表达了对他的喜爱。 “他对我来说似乎是永恒的，”科汉说。 Byers 告诉我，Kelly 拥有 Axios 联合创始人 Jim VandeHei 和前 CNN 老板 Zucker 的领导才能，尤其是“让人们对自己感觉良好和自信”。他向记者推销的部分内容是，他们可以写下他们在以前的雇主那里想要或不被允许的方式。 “我认为乔恩对真正有趣的故事感兴趣，”为帕克报道硅谷亿万富翁的记者泰迪施莱弗说。 “作为一个新闻消费者，现在这么多东西实在是太无聊了。”作为一名编辑，凯利可以挑战极限。一位曾与凯利共事并喜欢他的记者告诉我，他一直在推动出版，即使记者认为他们没有记录在案的商品。 “他真正的主旨是‘你真正想知道的是人们私下会告诉你什么。’”负责 Puck 政治报道的 Tara Palmeri 说，凯利的恶作剧是她渴望与之合作的原因之一他。 “我认为他得到了引起关注和人们感兴趣的东西，”她说。

Puck writers also receive superlative-laden billing in Kelly’s Saturday newsletter. Belloni is a “peerless Hollywood expert”; Byers is a “peerless media reporter” who moves the stock market; and “peerless” Ioffe writes with “characteristic perspicacity and wit.” Kelly devoted a whole newsletter to Palmeri’s arrival at the site. Some of the staff have, for one reason or another, had trouble fitting in elsewhere. Palmeri left Politico after clashing with her colleagues. Cohan, once a _Vanity Fair_ writer, said that, after Jones took over the magazine, his print stories started to be killed. “At the end of the day,” he said, “I’m just a late-middle-age white guy, so maybe I didn’t fit in anymore into the new gestalt of _Vanity Fair_.”

冰球作家还在凯利的周六时事通讯中收到最高级的账单。贝洛尼是“绝世好莱坞专家”；拜尔斯是一位撼动股市的“绝世媒体记者”； “无与伦比”的 Ioffe 以“特有的洞察力和机智”写作。凯利用一整篇时事通讯来报道帕尔梅里到达该网站的消息。由于某种原因，一些员工难以适应其他地方。 Palmeri 在与同事发生冲突后离开了 Politico。曾经是《名利场》作家的科汉说，在琼斯接手该杂志后，他的印刷故事开始被扼杀。 “归根结底，”他说，“我只是一个中年白人，所以也许我不再适合名利场的新格式塔。”

Nguyen, who previously worked at Politico and _Vanity Fair_, said she’s acutely aware that the world Puck covers is overwhelmingly white. (So is the staff; out of eleven writers, Nguyen and Baratunde Thurston, a cultural critic, are the only people of color.) But, she added, “my Vietnamese family members can sign up and read the exact same information that Warren Buffett is salivating over.” I asked Thurston about the site’s whiteness. “I’m not surprised by it, given what Puck is covering, the types of people who have been doing that coverage, and the types of people who can take a leap into a startup with the higher risk that that entails,” he said. “I hope you’re asking that of not just the founding partners but the founders.” I did. “We strive to be as diverse a company as we can, and it’s something we think about daily,” Kelly told me.

Nguyen 曾在 Politico 和 Vanity Fair 工作过，她说她敏锐地意识到 Puck 封面的世界绝大多数是白人。 （员工也是如此；在 11 位作家中，只有 Nguyen 和文化评论家 Baratunde Thurston 是有色人种。）但是，她补充说，“我的越南家庭成员可以注册并阅读与沃伦巴菲特完全相同的信息流口水了。”我向瑟斯顿询问了该网站的白度。 “我对此并不感到惊讶，考虑到 Puck 所报道的内容，一直在做这种报道的人的类型，以及可以冒着更高风险进入初创公司的人的类型，”他说. “我希望你问的不仅仅是创始合伙人，还有创始人。”我做到了。 “我们努力成为一家尽可能多元化的公司，这是我们每天都在思考的事情，”凯利告诉我。

Byers, who lives in L.A., met me for lunch in New York this fall. He wore black pants and a black shirt with a few buttons undone, and his curly hair was slicked back. He said he’d been nervous at the outset that no one would pick up his calls because Puck wasn’t a mainstream outlet. But that worry had been quickly allayed. “The attention on us from the people we write about is really big,” he said. “The lines of communication are far more open than they’ve ever been at any point in my career—which is really great.”

住在洛杉矶的拜尔斯今年秋天在纽约与我共进午餐。他穿着黑色裤子和黑色衬衫，几颗扣子没扣好，卷发梳在脑后。他说一开始他很紧张，因为 Puck 不是主流媒体，所以没有人会接他的电话。不过这种担心很快就被打消了。 “我们所写的人对我们的关注真的很大，”他说。 “沟通渠道比我职业生涯中的任何时候都更加开放——这真的很棒。”

Byers is a dogged reporter who is steeped in the business of media. He gets scoops—he broke the recent news that CNN would need to make brutal, hundred-million-dollar budget cuts. But several journalists I spoke with, none of whom wanted to be named, criticized him for, among other things, sometimes being a little too credulous of his sources and their agendas, a classic pitfall of access journalism. “Just Spoke to Sheryl…” was the headline on a June 1 [piece](https://puck.news/just-spoke-to-sheryl/) about Sheryl Sandberg’s seemingly sudden departure from Meta. “What I am told by Sandberg herself, as well as several other reliable sources inside Menlo Park, is that there’s no dramatic backstory,” Byers wrote. In the following days, the _Wall Street Journal_ [reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/meta-scrutinizing-sheryl-sandbergs-use-of-facebook-resources-over-several-years-11654882829) [that](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-sheryl-sandberg-quit-facebook-meta-11654215712) Sandberg had left amid an investigation into her use of company resources for personal matters. In October, 2021, Byers [cited](https://puck.news/could-disney-spin-off-espn/) two sources who said that the then Disney C.E.O., Bob Chapek, had asked associates to explore the “strategic rationale” for potentially spinning off ESPN from the company. The headline and framing—”Will Disney and ESPN Consciously Uncouple?”—made the move seem imminent, and the conversations serious. But what the piece ultimately described sounded like run-of-the-mill corporate brainstorming. If the sources were looking to trial-balloon their theory, it worked; Disney’s stock price went up by two per cent. The company pushed back on Byers’s reporting, and nine months later he [wrote](https://puck.news/fast-times-at-sun-valley-high/) that Chapek “has now abandoned the effort to spin off ESPN.” In November, 2021, Byers [wrote](https://puck.news/can-jake-tapper-get-9-p-m/) that Bob Iger would temporarily extend his tenure as chairman of the board at Disney. A month later, the company announced that he would leave at the planned time. Byers followed up with an explanation about why his sources had been right at the time but were not anymore. It seemed, more than anything, that Byers was angry that the episode had given “Disney P.R. full license to rain down invective on my integrity.”

Byers 是一位顽强的记者，专注于媒体业务。他得到了独家新闻——他爆料了最近的新闻，称 CNN 需要进行残酷的、数亿美元的预算削减。但与我交谈过的几位记者都批评他，除其他外，有时他对他的消息来源和他们的议程有点过于轻信，这是访问新闻的典型陷阱，他们中没有人愿意透露姓名。 “刚和 Sheryl 谈过……”是 6 月 1 日一篇关于 Sheryl Sandberg 似乎突然离开 Meta 的文章的标题。 “桑德伯格本人以及门洛帕克内部的其他几个可靠消息来源告诉我的是，没有戏剧性的背景故事，”拜尔斯写道。在接下来的几天里，《华尔街日报》报道称，桑德伯格在对她将公司资源用于个人事务的调查中离职。 2021 年 10 月，拜尔斯援引两位消息人士的话说，当时的迪士尼首席执行官鲍勃·查佩克 (Bob Chapek) 曾要求员工探讨可能从公司剥离 ESPN 的“战略依据”。标题和框架——“迪斯尼和 ESPN 会有意识地脱钩吗？”——让这一举动看起来迫在眉睫，谈话也很严肃。但这篇文章最终描述的内容听起来像是普通的企业头脑风暴。如果消息来源想试探他们的理论，那它就奏效了；迪士尼的股价上涨了 2%。该公司反驳了拜尔斯的报道，九个月后他写道，查佩克“现在已经放弃了剥离 ESPN 的努力。” 2021 年 11 月，拜尔斯写道，鲍勃·艾格将暂时延长他作为迪士尼董事会主席的任期。一个月后，公司宣布他将按计划离职。 拜尔斯接着解释了为什么他的消息来源在当时是正确的，但现在却不正确了。最重要的是，拜尔斯似乎很生气，因为这一集让“迪士尼公关部获得了对我的正直进行辱骂的充分许可。”

Byers told me he stands by his reporting, and Kelly defended him. “Dylan is the best media reporter in the business. These criticisms sound like sour grapes.”

拜尔斯告诉我他坚持他的报道，凯利为他辩护。 “迪伦是业内最好的媒体记者。这些批评听起来像是酸葡萄。”

Puck has acquired more than thirty thousand subscribers. Two-thirds of them are individuals or corporations and the other third are institutions, such as Princeton University. Puck’s goal is to upgrade its members from a basic subscription to one that includes off-the-record advisory calls with Puck writers for two hundred and fifty dollars a year. Belloni and Byers aren’t just reporters, Kelly told me—they’re “domain experts.” A truly engaged reader might pay to go to an off-the-record dinner, or attend a future Aspen- or Sun Valley-type event sponsored by Puck.

Puck 已获得超过三万名订阅者。其中三分之二是个人或公司，另外三分之一是机构，例如普林斯顿大学。 Puck 的目标是将其会员从基本订阅升级为包括与 Puck 作家的非正式咨询电话，每年收费 250 美元。贝洛尼和拜尔斯不仅仅是记者，凯利告诉我——他们是“领域专家”。一个真正参与的读者可能会花钱去参加一个非正式的晚宴，或者参加一个由帕克赞助的未来的阿斯彭或太阳谷类型的活动。

Puck, which raised seven million dollars from TPG and Standard Industries in its initial round of funding, is looking to close a Series B round by early next year. According to somebody close to it, Puck has been approached by about a dozen investors, and hopes to raise between fifteen million and twenty million dollars. The _Times_ [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/20/business/media/newsletters-bubble.html) that Puck is aiming for a valuation of at least seventy-five million dollars. The site plans to use the investment to expand its range of coverage, among other things. A Puck for the fashion industry is one potential spinoff. Puck’s success rests on readers’—and advertisers’—continued belief that they are part of some élite set. And their willingness to pay for a certain kind of information, the sort that might help a person sitting in an assistant’s desk, or in middle management, become conversant in the gossip of the C-suite. In that way, Puck is a sort of trade publication for a privileged class of strivers.

Puck 在首轮融资中从 TPG 和 Standard Industries 筹集了 700 万美元，希望在明年初完成 B 轮融资。据知情人士透露，已有十几位投资者接洽了 Puck，希望筹集 1500 万至 2000 万美元。据《泰晤士报》报道，Puck 的目标估值至少为 7500 万美元。该网站计划利用这笔投资扩大其覆盖范围等。时尚界的 Puck 是一个潜在的衍生产品。 Puck 的成功取决于读者和广告商的持续信念，即他们是某些精英群体的一部分。他们愿意为某种信息付费，这种信息可能会帮助坐在助理办公桌前或中层管理人员的人熟悉最高管理层的八卦。这样，Puck 是一种面向特权阶级奋斗者的商业出版物。

Kelly has spent so much of his life around staggering power and wealth, able to take advantage of it but not quite run his own fingers through it. Perhaps that is why being on the inside has taken on such importance in his life and in the publication he’s founded. “I feel like he personifies Puck,” Schleifer said.

凯利一生中的大部分时间都围绕着惊人的权力和财富，他能够利用它，但他自己的手指却没有完全掌握。也许这就是为什么在他的生活和他创立的出版物中，身处内部变得如此重要。 “我觉得他是帕克的化身，”施莱弗说。

On a recent afternoon, I connected with Graydon Carter on Zoom. (Our first meeting was postponed because of Queen Elizabeth II’s death; his wife’s father worked as Her Majesty’s deputy private secretary for years.) “Some of the essential elements of a good editor are, obviously, have familiarity with the language—but also knowledge, curiosity, contacts, and energy,” Carter said, his gossamer flip of hair backlit by a massive antique map of Paris. Carter guessed that Kelly was entering his prime. “I think the sweet spot for all that to be completely activated is between the age of forty and about fifty-five. After fifty-five, the energy slides, and before forty, the knowledge and the contacts are not complete.” By that estimate, at least, now’s the time for Jon Kelly to make his fortune. ♦

最近的一个下午，我在 Zoom 上与 Graydon Carter 取得了联系。 （由于伊丽莎白二世女王的去世，我们的第一次会面被推迟了；他妻子的父亲曾担任女王陛下的副私人秘书多年。） 、好奇心、人脉和活力，”卡特说，他轻飘飘的头发被一张巨大的巴黎古董地图背光照亮。卡特猜测，凯利正步入巅峰时期。 “我认为完全激活所有这些的最佳点是在四十到五十五岁之间。五十五岁以后精气流失，四十岁以前见识不全。”至少按照这个估计，现在是乔恩·凯利发家致富的时候了。 ♦
