I was devastated when Google Reader shut down. I loved it as much as I love Microsoft Excel, and for the same reason: it gave me a superpower. With Reader, I could discover and stay on top of the latest information across the internet, no matter how frequently or infrequently a person posted.

当 Google Reader 关闭时，我感到非常震惊。我喜欢它就像喜欢 Microsoft Excel 一样，出于同样的原因：它给了我超能力。使用 Reader，我可以发现并掌握互联网上的最新信息，无论一个人发布的频率有多高。

I’ve watched many beloved Google products get shut down: Wave, Inbox, My Maps, Stadia. [The list goes on and on](https://killedbygoogle.com/). It’s gotten bad enough that people widely believe the shutdowns [damage Google’s brand](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/04/googles-constant-product-shutdowns-are-damaging-its-brand/).

我看到许多心爱的 Google 产品被关闭：Wave、Inbox、My Maps、Stadia。清单不胜枚举。已经够糟糕的了，人们普遍认为关闭会损害谷歌的品牌。

So why do they keep doing it?  
那么他们为什么要继续这样做呢？  

Because Google has a company strategy, but they don’t make product strategies.

因为谷歌有公司战略，但他们不制定产品战略。

Based on my time at Google, and everything I’ve seen since, Google’s company strategy is “Hire all the smart people.” Hire all the smart people and let them build. Hire all the smart people so they can’t work at a competitor. Hire all the smart people even if we don’t have something important for them to work on.

根据我在谷歌的经历，以及我从那以后所看到的一切，谷歌的公司战略是“雇佣所有聪明人”。雇用所有聪明人，让他们建造。雇用所有聪明人，这样他们就不会在竞争对手那里工作。雇用所有聪明人，即使我们没有重要的事情让他们去做。

Google acts like a venture capitalist, investing in promising people with the expectation that most will fail. They invest broadly in search of the idea that will deliver 100x. Let 1000 flowers bloom, and see which are the best.

谷歌就像一个风险投资家，投资于有前途的人，并期望大多数人会失败。他们广泛投资于寻找能够实现 100 倍效果的想法。让1000朵花绽放，看看哪朵最好。

To support this company strategy, Google makes it really, _really_ easy for anyone to start up a new project. The culture of “20% time” gives people permission to work on ideas outside of their primary role. There’s only the lightest of reviews needed to launch a “1% experiment.” Micro-kitchens and fun activities encourage the socializing that brings ad-hoc teams together.

为了支持这一公司战略，谷歌让任何人都可以非常非常容易地启动一个新项目。 “20% 时间”的文化允许人们在他们的主要角色之外处理想法。启动“1% 实验”只需要最简单的评论。微型厨房和有趣的活动鼓励将临时团队聚集在一起的社交活动。

Google’s company strategy is closely tied to the lack of product strategy. To explain this, let me contrast with Microsoft.

谷歌的公司战略与产品战略的缺乏密切相关。为了解释这一点，让我与微软进行对比。

At Microsoft, product leaders had a strong conviction of what it would take to succeed.

在微软，产品负责人对成功的条件有着坚定的信念。

Steven Sinofsky was the VP in charge of the Office division at the time I was there. He wrote long strategy documents about what we were building, why, and how. The VP below him then created a strategy document that filled in the details for the Office Server Group. And the GPM below him then wrote a strategy document for SharePoint. By the time you got down to me, I was responsible for delivering a very constrained slice of the product. Each piece fit into the larger puzzle.

我在的时候，Steven Sinofsky 是负责办公室部门的副总裁。他写了很长的战略文件，说明我们正在建设什么、为什么以及如何建设。他手下的副总裁随后创建了一份战略文档，其中填写了 Office Server Group 的详细信息。然后他下面的 GPM 为 SharePoint 编写了一份战略文档。当你找到我时，我负责交付一个非常有限的产品部分。每一块都适合更大的拼图。

My work was pre-approved. There was space for me to plan what my teams worked on, but each item needed to tie into a pillar of the broader Office strategy. Everything I wanted to build was reviewed during an“adds/cuts” meeting before it got started.

我的工作是预先批准的。我有足够的空间来规划我的团队的工作，但每个项目都需要与更广泛的 Office 战略的支柱联系起来。在开始之前，我想要构建的所有内容都在“添加/削减”会议上进行了审查。

With all that up-front planning, the actual product decisions and working code were reviewed much less. Only the other PMs on my team reviewed my specs, and only me and the tester (also new grads usually) reviewed the working changes before they were added to the branch. For what it’s worth, I think this is why the quality of the details on Microsoft products is often lacking—a random PM made a decision and no one bothered to push back on it.

通过所有这些前期计划，实际产品决策和工作代码的审查要少得多。只有我团队中的其他 PM 审查了我的规范，只有我和测试人员（通常也是新毕业生）在将工作更改添加到分支之前审查了它们。就其价值而言，我认为这就是为什么 Microsoft 产品的细节质量经常缺乏的原因——一个随机的 PM 做出了一个决定，没有人费心去反对它。

Contrast that with Google.  
将其与谷歌进行对比。  

At Google, I never saw a strategy document. I went to every Friday all-hands, but I didn’t hear the leaders talk about a broad vision of what we needed to build. The people above me didn’t set direction and ask me to follow it.

在谷歌，我从未见过战略文件。我每个星期五都去参加全体会议，但我没有听到领导人谈论我们需要建立什么的广泛愿景。我上面的人没有设定方向并要求我遵循它。

Instead, leaders encouraged teams to generate their own ideas. The founders had ideas of their top priorities and worked with the relevant teams on those, but the list of the top company OKRs was a subset of all the OKRs, not a roll-up. Some people were not working on anything the company cared about strategically!

相反，领导者鼓励团队产生自己的想法。创始人对他们的首要任务有想法，并与相关团队合作，但顶级公司 OKR 的列表是所有 OKR 的子集，而不是汇总。有些人没有在公司战略上关心的任何事情上工作！

Microsoft would have shut all those other projects down. Google let them have a chance. But just a chance.

微软会关闭所有其他项目。谷歌让他们有机会。但只是一个机会。

These projects weren’t pre-approved. There was no guarantee that your work would launch. Google didn’t really care if they launched, even if your team had spent months on it. Each new feature, product, or change needed to prove itself.

这些项目没有预先批准。无法保证您的工作会启动。谷歌并不真正关心他们是否推出，即使你的团队已经花了几个月的时间。每个新功能、产品或更改都需要证明自己。

As an APM, I loved this. I told candidates that Google was a much better environment than Microsoft for smart and ambitious people, because there was space to make your ideas happen. At Microsoft, everything was so top down. Leaders had already decided what we needed to build, so I’d felt like I was swimming upstream to get my ideas heard.

作为 APM，我喜欢这个。我告诉求职者，对于聪明和有抱负的人来说，谷歌是一个比微软更好的环境，因为那里有实现你的想法的空间。在微软，一切都是自上而下的。领导们已经决定了我们需要构建什么，所以我觉得我正在逆流而上，让别人听到我的想法。

In retrospect, I don’t think my feelings matched reality. Yes, I’d felt like I was swimming upstream, but the big ideas I’d fought for (Firefox support, Wikis) actually launched. I cobbled them together whispering with engineers and relying on interns, but no one was mad when they found out. Google had the advantage that the culture supported pushing for new ideas, but at a cost.

回想起来，我认为我的感受与现实不符。是的，我感觉自己在逆流而上，但我为之奋斗的伟大想法（Firefox 支持、Wikis）实际上启动了。我通过与工程师窃窃私语并依靠实习生将它们拼凑在一起，但当他们发现时没有人生气。谷歌的优势在于其文化支持推动新想法，但要付出代价。

Google’s company strategy works, but I think it comes at the expense of the employees and users. It especially comes at a cost to medium-scale products.

谷歌的公司战略是有效的，但我认为这是以牺牲员工和用户为代价的。它尤其以中型产品为代价。

About two years into my time at Google, two engineers from the Trondheim, Norway office came to meet me. They’d spent the last few months trying to improve a particular type of query popular in Norway. Now they wanted my help launching it.

我在谷歌工作大约两年后，挪威特隆赫姆办事处的两名工程师来见我。在过去的几个月里，他们一直在努力改进在挪威流行的一种特定类型的查询。现在他们需要我的帮助来启动它。

It was immediately obvious to me that the idea was flawed. Their change didn’t make the search results better, and it unfairly promoted some sites over others. I checked with the engineering leadership and they agreed. Those engineers had been wasting their time.

我立即意识到这个想法是有缺陷的。他们的改变并没有使搜索结果更好，而且不公平地提升了一些网站。我咨询了工程领导，他们同意了。那些工程师一直在浪费时间。

I tried to figure out who was the right person to deliver the bad news. I was shocked to learn that it was me. I’d never heard from those engineers or anyone on their team before. The project had been started and worked on (I think even A/B tested), without any input from the people who would ultimately need to approve their change. A few months later, the entire Norway office was shut down.

我试图弄清楚谁是传达坏消息的合适人选。得知是我，我很震惊。我以前从未听过那些工程师或他们团队中任何人的消息。该项目已经开始并在进行中（我认为甚至进行了 A/B 测试），但没有来自最终需要批准其更改的人员的任何输入。几个月后，整个挪威办事处被关闭。

… ……

I was at Google when Google Plus started. Some APMs had convinced company leadership that we needed a Facebook competitor. The VP in charge of Google Plus hosted the Friday all-hands several times to get us all excited about what they were building. It was obvious to me and many others that there was no reason for people already on Facebook to switch from Facebook. Someone asked a direct question, but the VP deflected and talked about how easy it would be to group your friends with the Circles feature — which was not at all a reason to switch.

Google Plus 开始时我在谷歌工作。一些 APM 使公司领导层相信我们需要 Facebook 的竞争对手。负责 Google Plus 的副总裁多次主持了周五的全体会议，让我们都对他们正在建设的东西感到兴奋。对我和其他许多人来说，很明显，已经在 Facebook 上的人没有理由从 Facebook 切换。有人问了一个直接的问题，但副总裁转移话题并谈到用圈子功能将你的朋友分组是多么容易——这根本不是转换的理由。

It seemed like Google didn’t have the processes or experience to get the product strategy right. “Who are our potential users and what does it take to win them?” is product strategy 101. Maybe someone raised this question in an exec review, but it didn’t become a launch blocker. Google+ never took off, and was eventually shut down.

谷歌似乎没有制定正确产品战略的流程或经验。 “谁是我们的潜在用户，如何才能赢得他们？”是产品策略 101。也许有人在执行审查中提出了这个问题，但它并没有成为启动障碍。 Google+ 从未起飞，最终被关闭。

I think the lack of a product strategy is behind many of Google’s short-lived products. Projects like Google Wave, Google Inbox, or Stadia get the go-ahead without a deep, structured, well-reviewed plan for how they’re going to succeed and why they’re important. Some smart, ambitious person at the company spear-heads the project and pushes it through to launch. When the product isn’t a runaway success, Google cuts its losses and moves on to the next thing.

我认为缺乏产品战略是谷歌许多短命产品背后的原因。像 Google Wave、Google Inbox 或 Stadia 这样的项目在没有一个深入的、结构化的、经过充分审查的计划来说明它们将如何成功以及为什么它们很重要的情况下就获得了批准。公司里一些聪明、雄心勃勃的人带头领导这个项目，并推动它启动。当产品没有取得巨大成功时，谷歌就会减少损失并继续做下一件事。

If Google didn’t start with a conviction that they needed the product, it makes sense that they wouldn’t have the stamina to keep iterating and investing. Most other companies don’t have the money to build and launch products with such little conviction and oversight. Other companies need their products to succeed, so they try harder & smarter to make the products successful.

如果谷歌一开始并没有坚信他们需要该产品，那么他们就没有精力继续迭代和投资是有道理的。大多数其他公司没有足够的资金在如此缺乏信念和监督的情况下制造和推出产品。其他公司需要他们的产品取得成功，所以他们更加努力和聪明地使产品成功。

Why do I care? Google Reader was around long enough to drive Bloglines out of business. Google Inbox was around long enough to drive Mailbox out of business. I miss those products.

我为什么要关心？ Google Reader 存在的时间足以让 Bloglines 破产。 Google Inbox 存在的时间长到足以让 Mailbox 倒闭。我想念那些产品。

I usually avoid such pointed critiques, but I’m sharing my thoughts here because one of my key personal values is that I think people’s time and effort is precious.

我通常会避免这种尖锐的批评，但我在这里分享我的想法是因为我的一个重要个人价值观是我认为人们的时间和努力是宝贵的。

I was drawn to Asana because the world would be a better place if people spent less time on work-about-work and more time doing what they love.

我被 Asana 所吸引，因为如果人们花更少的时间在工作上，花更多的时间做他们喜欢做的事情，世界将会变得更美好。

I care about product strategy because the world would be a better place if people spend less time on failed projects and more time working on things that make a difference.

我关心产品战略，因为如果人们花更少的时间在失败的项目上，花更多的时间在能带来改变的事情上，世界将会变得更美好。

I hope that people who choose to work at Google can do so with their eyes open. I still think the company can be a wonderful place to work, but only if you’re okay with the risk that your product work might be wasted.

我希望选择在谷歌工作的人能够擦亮眼睛。我仍然认为公司可以成为一个很棒的工作场所，但前提是你可以接受你的产品工作可能被浪费的风险。

I’m sure some of my memories and analysis here is wrong. I’d love you to share your corrections, disagreements, memories, and analysis in the comments!

我敢肯定我这里的一些记忆和分析是错误的。我希望您能在评论中分享您的更正、分歧、回忆和分析！
