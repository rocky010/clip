[Ben Kuhn](https://www.benkuhn.net/) thinks dispensing life advice is underrated and that we should do it more. In that spirit, here's some of it.

[本·库恩 ( Ben Kuhn)](https://www.benkuhn.net/) 认为提供生活建议的做法被低估了，我们应该多做一些。 本着这种精神，这里有一些。

When making decisions we take a lot for granted. Most of this is fine, and it's not really feasible to avoid making assumptions completely. If you go out to buy bread, you're assuming the bakery you're going to is open, that they have the bread you want, and that you are not going to get murdered on the way there. You could, in principle, before taking any action, check on Google Maps that the bakery is open or call them to check if they have rye bread that day. But if you do this for every single thing you do in a day you won’t be able to get much done.

在做决定时，我们认为很多事情都是理所当然的。 这大部分都很好，完全避免做出假设并不是真正可行的。 如果你出去买面包，你会假设你要去的面包店是开着的，他们有你想要的面包，而且你不会在去那里的路上被谋杀。 原则上，在采取任何行动之前，您可以在谷歌地图上查看面包店是否营业，或者打电话给他们检查当天是否有黑麦面包。 但是，如果你对一天中所做的每一件事都这样做，你将无法完成很多事情。

Most life advice is very generic. If I just tell you to “stop assuming so much” it’s not clear what you should change about your life. I am not saying you have to be seeking perfect certainty in every situation; gathering information has costs. So what am I saying here? I could be saying that on the margin you should check your assumptions more often in general but this wouldn’t be quite right, because in many contexts the default assumptions we make are perfectly valid and do not need to be challenged all the time.

大多数人生建议都很笼统。 如果我只是告诉你“停止假设太多”，那么你并不清楚你应该改变你的生活。 我并不是说您必须在每种情况下都寻求绝对的确定性。 收集信息是有成本的。 那我在这里说什么？ 我可能会说，总体而言，您应该更频繁地检查您的假设，但这并不完全正确，因为在许多情况下，我们所做的默认假设是完全有效的，不需要一直受到挑战。

Instead, what I am saying is that for situations that you consider important to you (everything from relationships to employment), set some time aside to think about the assumptions you are making in that context. Then think about the cost to transform an assumption into a certainty. If it seems worth it, then do that.

相反，我要说的是，对于你认为对你来说很重要的情况（从人际关系到就业的一切），留出一些时间来思考你在这种情况下所做的假设。 然后考虑将假设转化为确定性的成本。 如果这看起来值得，那就去做吧。

But even saying this is not enough, so I will run you through a bunch of examples so you get an idea of exactly what I mean, hoping also that the examples will be memorable enough you will remember them when you are thinking about assumptions you are making. As Ben p[oints out](https://www.benkuhn.net/weeklyessays/), advice is easy to understand, but hard to implement. It's easy to understand why doing something may be useful to do, but then often we don't do as the advice says, despite rationally endorsing it.

但即使说这些还不够，所以我将通过一系列示例让您了解我的意思，同时希望这些示例足够令人难忘，您在考虑假设时会记住它们制造。 正如 Ben [指出的那样](https://www.benkuhn.net/weeklyessays/) ，建议很容易理解，但很难实施。 很容易理解为什么做某事可能是有用的，但尽管我们理性地支持建议，但我们常常没有按照建议去做。

I suspect this is because advice tends to be given in very generic terms: the advice-giver is already following the advice so they tell you what they do but they don’t give you a strong justification for why _you_ should do it, or how to get yourself to do it when you are getting started.

我怀疑这是因为建议往往以非常笼统的术语给出：提供建议的人已经在遵循建议，所以他们告诉你他们做了什么，但他们没有给你一个强有力的理由说明 _你_ 为什么应该这样做，或者如何做在你开始的时候让自己去做。

My first example is the one time when I _assumed_ that one can only hold one [O1 visa](https://nintil.com/us-immigration) at a time (I currently hold two). I was aware that one could _transfer_ visas to new employers and that it was possible to get hired by a company of one's creation, have that entity contract with various parties, and thus be able to work multiple jobs. No one I know has two O1 visas. I didn't even try to search whether this was possible online, despite the fact that there are various sources that will in fact tell you that it is possible to have multiple O1s. It was only when I was talking to someone about this when I was asked if I knew _for sure_ about this and I of course said no; then I was simply asked to go check. Thinking "sure, checking takes 5 seconds, even if the answer is going to be that you can't have concurrent O1 visas", I emailed my lawyer, getting shortly after confirmation that indeed in fact it's possible to have concurrent O1 visas. I then applied for, and successfully was granted, a second O1.

我的第一个例子是有一次我 _假设_ 一个人一次只能持有一个 [O1 签证](https://nintil.com/us-immigration) （我目前持有两个）。 我知道一个人可以 _将_ 签证转让给新的雇主，并且有可能被自己创建的公司雇用，让该实体与各方签订合同，从而能够从事多项工作。 我认识的人都没有两个 O1 签证。 我什至没有尝试在网上搜索这是否可能，尽管事实上有各种来源会告诉你有多个 O1 是可能的。 只有当我和某人谈论这件事时，当我被问到是否 _确定_ 知道这件事时，我当然说不知道； 然后我只是被要求去检查。 想着“当然，检查需要 5 秒，即使答案是你不能同时拥有 O1 签证”，我给我的律师发了电子邮件，在确认实际上确实可以同时拥有 O1 签证后不久。 然后我申请并成功获得了第二个 O1。

This may sound silly to you. In retrospect it does seem so to me. Checking whether one can have multiple concurrent O1s takes 5 seconds on Google (or asking a lawyer); the cost is low and the expected payoff (getting the visa) high. But to me this, at the time, surprising as it may seem, looked the same as "I know there is a bakery in that corner, no need to check the map", I was too overconfident in my guess.

这对你来说可能听起来很傻。 回想起来对我来说确实如此。 检查一个人是否可以有多个并发的O1在谷歌上需要5秒（或问律师）； 成本低，预期回报（获得签证）高。 但在当时的我看来，这似乎令人惊讶，就像“我知道那个角落里有一家面包店，不用看地图”一样，我的猜测过于自信了。

Another immigration-related example of this is applying for my _first_ O1: Having read the [list of requirements](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-2-part-m-chapter-4#3) I thought I would not be able to meet them. My friends told me that I would probably be able to, because the way in which the O1 criteria are examined is not as strict as what the language they are written in suggests: you have to be good, but not necessarily Nobel Prize-winning good. In this case "knowing" for sure if one can get a visa means applying for it (which costs money). However, a good proxy for this is, once again, talking to a lawyer. You might then assume that talking to a lawyer costs money, but now figuring this out is free: Just email a lawyer a question and see if they charge you for an answer (The answer is no, in general immigration lawyers don't charge for these first consultations with them).

另一个与移民相关的例子是申请我的 _第一个_ O1：阅读 [要求列表后，](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-2-part-m-chapter-4#3) 我认为我无法满足它们。 我的朋友告诉我，我可能可以，因为审查O1标准的方式并不像他们所写的语言所暗示的那样严格：你必须是优秀的，但不一定是诺贝尔奖得主. 在这种情况下，“知道”确定是否可以获得签证意味着申请它（这需要花钱）。 然而，一个很好的替代方法是再次与律师交谈。 然后你可能会认为与律师交谈要花钱，但现在弄清楚这个是免费的：只需给律师发邮件一个问题，看看他们是否会向你收取答复费用（答案是不收费，一般来说移民律师不收取费用）这些与他们的第一次磋商）。

When talking with Ben Kuhn about these examples, he pointed me to [one of his recurring pieces of advice](https://twitter.com/benskuhn/status/1321932187911028736) he gives during 1:1 to his reports: If someone _thinks_ someone else is annoyed at them for whatever reason, then they should go and talk to them instead of letting it go. It may be that a) It was all in their head (so they assumed wrongly, in which case any potential conflict is defused) or b) They were in fact annoyed at them (they assumed correctly! And now they can talk about why and how to fix that).

在与本·库恩 (Ben Kuhn) 谈论这些例子时，他向我指出了 [反复提出的一条建议](https://twitter.com/benskuhn/status/1321932187911028736) 他在 1:1 报告中 _：如果有人认为_ 其他人出于某种原因对他们感到恼火，那么他们应该去和他们谈谈他们而不是放手。 可能是 a) 这一切都在他们的脑海中（所以他们假设错误，在这种情况下，任何潜在的冲突都被化解了）或 b) 他们实际上对他们很生气（他们假设正确！现在他们可以谈论为什么和如何解决）。

When working on [](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://astera.org/rejuvenome/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1671040804463695&usg=AOvVaw2HLYNWuH7X209CiQhXmQZd)[Rejuvenome](https://astera.org/rejuvenome/), one key design decision we had to make was how many mice each cohort should have. This not only depends on statistical power, but also on how many cohorts are being run simultaneously, and what the mortality curves for the mice look like. The capacity of the room where the mice were was about 5000, so on paper the study should ramp up cohorts until the ceiling of 5000 was reached, and then enroll mice at a rate similar to the rate at which mice die. We had a plan and we roughly _assumed_ there would be enough space for that plan. As the time to order the mice came closer, I began thinking more about whether we really had enough space for all these mice. Eventually, I decided to write a simple simulation model, accounting for age-dependent mouse mortality, in Python and run it to see what the plan implied in terms of mice present in the cages at any given time. The result was that the rather ambitious design was unfeasible. If we also wanted to test enough cohorts to go through many interventions, we would need to either scale down or get a bigger room. This came as a surprise, but then the project was quickly redesigned to achieve most of what we wanted, by dropping a requirement (statistical power to detect small lifespan changes), which allowed us to have smaller cohorts, fitting all the mice in that given room. Fortunately we realized this early enough, but it should have been even earlier: the work required to write the model and play with various scenarios is perhaps one day of work, but the impact on everything from hiring to projected costs is substantial.

在研究 [](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://astera.org/rejuvenome/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1671040804463695&usg=AOvVaw2HLYNWuH7X209CiQhXmQZd)[Rejuvenome](https://astera.org/rejuvenome/) 时，我们必须做出的一个关键设计决定是每个队列应该有多少只小鼠。 这不仅取决于统计能力，还取决于同时运行的队列数量，以及小鼠的死亡率曲线是什么样的。 老鼠所在房间的容量约为 5000 只，因此从理论上讲，该研究应该增加队列，直到达到 5000 只的上限，然后以与老鼠死亡的速度相似的速度招募老鼠。 我们有一个计划，我们粗略 _地假设_ 该计划会有足够的空间。 随着订购老鼠的时间越来越近，我开始更多地考虑我们是否真的有足够的空间容纳所有这些老鼠。 最终，我决定用 Python 编写一个简单的模拟模型，考虑与年龄相关的小鼠死亡率，并运行它以查看该计划对任何给定时间笼子中出现的小鼠的暗示。 结果是，相当雄心勃勃的设计是不可行的。 如果我们还想测试足够多的队列以进行多次干预，我们将需要缩小规模或获得更大的房间。 这出人意料，但随后该项目被迅速重新设计以实现我们想要的大部分内容，通过放弃要求（检测微小寿命变化的统计能力），这使我们能够拥有更小的队列，使所有小鼠都能适应给定的条件房间。 幸运的是，我们很早就意识到这一点，但它应该更早：编写模型和玩各种场景所需的工作可能是一天的工作，但对从招聘到预计成本的一切影响都是巨大的。

Why did this happen? In retrospect it seems obvious: There were many things going on with the project, from figuring out the best way to process blood from mice to building data pipelines to get data from the instruments to a unified database. I didn't think enough about prioritization; what needed to be done today vs what could wait a bit longer, instead I just jumped into writing software because it's satisfying to do while thinking about prioritization work takes longer and it doesn't deliver the same dopamine hits that writing code delivers. Had I asked myself “Do I know for sure we can do what we are saying we are going to do?” I would have, in full honesty, said no. Then, when asked what can I do to make sure we can do the study I would have said "run a simulation and see what happens instead of guessing". Lastly, if asked “Is this a top priority? Are there more important things to do?” I would have realized this needed to be done as soon as possible.

为什么会这样？ 回想起来，这似乎是显而易见的：该项目进行了很多事情，从找出处理小鼠血液的最佳方法到构建数据管道以将数据从仪器获取到统一数据库。 我对优先顺序考虑得不够； 今天需要完成的事情与可以等待更长时间的事情，相反，我只是跳入编写软件，因为考虑优先级工作需要更长的时间并且它不会提供与编写代码所提供的相同的多巴胺命中率，所以这样做很令人满意。 我是否问过自己“我是否确定我们可以做到我们所说的我们将要做的事情？” 老实说，我会说不。 然后，当被问到我能做些什么来确保我们能够进行研究时，我会说“运行模拟，看看会发生什么，而不是猜测”。 最后，如果被问及“这是首要任务吗？ 还有更重要的事情要做吗？” 我会意识到这需要尽快完成。

Cold emailing is another case where assuming too much has costs. [Lots](https://colah.github.io/posts/2020-05-University/) has [been](https://guzey.com/personal/what-should-you-do-with-your-life/#cold-emails-and-twitter) written about why and how to cold email and getting over the reluctance to do it. Those experienced in a field, empirically, tend to enjoy talking about their work and helping newcomers. They don’t like feeling exploited. The desire to avoid bothering someone with an email is at the core of this, but rather than assume that a thoughtful, well crafted email bothers someone, check it: If you got the email you are about to send, would it bother you? Ask others that get cold emails, do they like to help others? The compiled knowledge of cold-emailers is that cold emailing works and that thoughtful cold emailing is well received, so stop assuming the contrary!

冷电子邮件是另一种假设过多会产生成本的情况。 [。](https://colah.github.io/posts/2020-05-University/) 了 [很多](https://guzey.com/personal/what-should-you-do-with-your-life/#cold-emails-and-twitter) 关于为什么以及如何发送冷电子邮件以及克服不愿意这样做的文章已经写 根据经验，那些在某个领域有经验的人往往喜欢谈论他们的工作并帮助新人。 他们不喜欢被剥削的感觉。 避免用电子邮件打扰某人的愿望是这一点的核心，但与其假设一封深思熟虑、精心制作的电子邮件会打扰某人，不如检查一下：如果您收到要发送的电子邮件，它会打扰您吗？ 问问那些收到冷邮件的人，他们喜欢帮助别人吗？ 冷电子邮件发送者的综合知识是冷电子邮件有效，深思熟虑的冷电子邮件很受欢迎，所以不要再假设相反了！

One last example comes from Tesla. There was a part in one of the cars that a team thought was there for safety reasons, and thus owned by a different team in charge of safety. Unbeknown to them, this second safety team believed the part was there to provide some other function, and was owned by the first team. As a result, the part was there for no reason. Eventually Elon just asked the teams about the part and got the part removed. In this particular case, it may have been cognitively taxing to check the ownership of every single part, so the solution is not for the engineers to have to make those checks all the time, rather one could have a well maintained database and processes to ensure every part has a reason to be there. As a general point, making awareness of relevant facts easier and cheaper makes it more likely that more assumptions will be checked and fewer mistakes made.

最后一个例子来自特斯拉。 出于安全原因，其中一辆车中有一个零件，因此由另一个负责安全的团队拥有。 他们不知道的是，这第二个安全团队认为该部件是用来提供其他功能的，并且由第一个团队拥有。 结果，该部分无缘无故地在那里。 最终 Elon 只是向团队询问了这个零件，然后就把这个零件拿走了。 在这种特殊情况下，检查每个零件的所有权可能在认知上很费力，因此解决方案不是让工程师必须一直进行这些检查，而是可以拥有一个维护良好的数据库和流程来确保每个部分都有存在的理由。 一般而言，让了解相关事实变得更容易、成本更低，就更有可能检查更多的假设并减少犯错的可能性。

Lastly, we can take the logic of this advice one step further: Sometimes we make mistakes because we assume too much. We can fix that by being more thoughtful about what we assume. But how do we do that? By thinking about _why_ we assume too much in some contexts. Some possible ideas to check:

最后，我们可以将这条建议的逻辑更进一步：有时我们犯错误是因为我们假设太多。 我们可以通过更深思熟虑我们的假设来解决这个问题。 但是我们该怎么做呢？ 通过思考 _为什么_ 我们在某些情况下假设太多。 一些可能的想法来检查：

-   Be more aware of why you are not checking a particular assumption. Checking an assumption might involve talking or emailing someone that for some reason one feels reluctant to. As a result we delude ourselves into thinking that the assumption is more solid than it is because in that case we don’t have to go check it. If this is the case, make it explicit, write “My project is in danger because I don’t want to send a brief email” and if it rings true, you may be able to send that email.
-   更清楚为什么不检查特定假设。 检查一个假设可能涉及与某人交谈或发送电子邮件，但由于某种原因人们不愿意这样做。 结果，我们自欺欺人地认为假设比实际情况更可靠，因为在那种情况下我们不必去检查它。 如果是这种情况，请明确说明，写下“我的项目处于危险之中，因为我不想发送简短的电子邮件”，如果它听起来是真的，您也许可以发送该电子邮件。
-   If something requires some effort or time to check, weigh explicitly this vs the potential downside of getting a decision wrong. Think whether there are simpler ways of checking.
-   如果某件事需要付出一些努力或时间来检查，请明确权衡这与做出错误决定的潜在负面影响。 想想是否有更简单的检查方法。
-   Request feedback from others. We can be blind to the fact we are making an assumption and it can be hard to notice what others can immediately see.
-   请求他人的反馈。 我们可能对我们正在做出假设的事实视而不见，并且很难注意到其他人可以立即看到的内容。
-   Commit to a habit of periodic review. We don’t set aside time to even go through what we are assuming in our various projects. This is, on paper, as easy as blocking off an hour on a given day and doing a review, but in practice it requires committing to a habit of periodic review.
-   养成定期回顾的习惯。 我们甚至没有留出时间来研究我们在各种项目中的假设。 从理论上讲，这就像在给定的一天抽出一个小时进行回顾一样简单，但在实践中，它需要养成定期回顾的习惯。

This latter point is the most important one. You can read this essay and nod throughout and then forget about it. Or you can pick some aspect of your life, book one hour in your calendar, and think about what assumptions you are making there. As I was writing this line I just did this. It’s just one hour! It could be today!

后一点是最重要的一点。 你可以读完这篇文章，通篇点头，然后忘记它。 或者你可以选择你生活的某个方面，在你的日历上预定一个小时，然后想想你在那里做了什么假设。 当我写这行时，我只是这样做了。 只有一个小时！ 可能是今天！
