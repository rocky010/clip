The change was gradual. At first, Riana Alexander was always tired. Then she began missing classes. She had been an honors student at her Arizona high school, just outside Phoenix. But last winter, after the isolation of remote learning, then the overload of a full-on return to school, her grades were slipping. She wasn’t eating a lot. She avoided friends.

变化是渐进的。 起初，Riana Alexander 总是很累。 然后她开始缺课。 她曾是亚利桑那州高中的优等生，就在凤凰城郊外。 但去年冬天，在远程学习被隔离，然后是全面返校的超负荷之后，她的成绩开始下滑。 她吃得不多。 她避开朋友。

Her worried mother searched for mental health treatment. Finally, in the spring, a three-day-a-week intensive program for depression helped the teenager steady herself and “want to get better,” Alexander said. Then, as she was finding her way, a girl at her school took her own life. Then a teen elsewhere in the district did the same. Then another.

她担心的母亲寻求心理健康治疗。 最后，在春天，每周三天的抑郁症强化训练帮助这名少年稳定了自己，并“想要变得更好，”亚历山大说。 然后，就在她找到自己的路时，她学校的一个女孩结束了自己的生命。 然后该地区其他地方的一名青少年也做了同样的事情。 然后另一个。

“It just broke my heart that there were three different people who were going through what I was, and they never got the chance to heal,” said Alexander, 17, now a high school senior.

“这让我很伤心，因为有三个不同的人正在经历我的经历，而他们从来没有机会治愈，”17 岁的亚历山大说，他现在是一名高中生。

After that devastating stretch in May, families and classmates in the Chandler Unified School District mourned the three 15-year-olds. They would enjoy no more summer vacations, no birthdays or graduations. The losses ignited a debate about what schools should be doing to support students in despair.

在 5 月那场毁灭性的灾难之后，钱德勒联合学区的家人和同学都为这三名 15 岁的孩子哀悼。 他们将不再享受暑假、生日或毕业典礼。 这些损失引发了一场关于学校应该做些什么来支持绝望学生的辩论。

Nationally, adolescent depression and anxiety — already at crisis levels before the pandemic — have surged amid the isolation, disruption and hardship of covid-19. Even as federal [coronavirus](https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_6) relief money has helped schools step up their efforts to aid students, they also have come up short. It’s unclear how much money is going to mental health, how long such efforts will last or if they truly reach those who struggle most.

在全国范围内，青少年的抑郁和焦虑——在大流行之前就已经处于危机水平——在 covid-19 的孤立、破坏和困难中激增。 尽管联邦 [冠状病毒](https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/?itid=lk_inline_manual_6) 救助资金帮助学校加大了对学生的援助力度，但它们也出现了短缺。 目前尚不清楚有多少资金用于心理健康，这些努力将持续多长时间，或者它们是否真正惠及那些最挣扎的人。

“The need is real, the need is dire,” said Alberto Carvalho, superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, who recalled hearing just that day from the district’s mental health partners that calls about suicidal thoughts had quadrupled. “We’re living through historically unprecedented times,” he said.

“需求是真实的，需求是可怕的，”洛杉矶联合学区的负责人阿尔贝托·卡瓦略 (Alberto Carvalho) 说，他回忆说，就在那天，学区的心理健康合作伙伴称，自杀念头翻了两番。 “我们正在经历历史上前所未有的时代，”他说。

More than 75 percent of schools surveyed in spring said their teachers and staff have voiced concerns about student depression, anxiety and trauma, according to [federal data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/05/31/schools-mental-health-covid-students/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8). Nearly as many schools cited a jump in the number of students seeking mental health services.

，在春季接受调查的学校中，超过 75% 的学校表示，他们的教师和教职员工表达了对学生抑郁、焦虑和创伤的担忧 [根据联邦数据](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/05/31/schools-mental-health-covid-students/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8) 。 几乎同样多的学校表示寻求心理健康服务的学生人数激增。

But mental health is not the only pandemic priority. Schools are spending vast sums of their coronavirus relief money on ventilation upgrades, expanded summer learning, after-school programs, tutors and academic specialists.

但心理健康并不是大流行病的唯一优先事项。 学校将大量冠状病毒救助资金用于通风升级、扩大暑期学习、课后计划、导师和学术专家。

The [federal spending plans](https://www.future-ed.org/financial-trends-in-local-schools-covid-aid-spending/) of 5,000 school districts nationally show that more than one-third intend to bring new mental health professionals into schools, and about 30 percent plan to fund social-emotional learning efforts, according to [an analysis by FutureEd](https://www.future-ed.org/local-covid-relief-spending/), a think tank at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.

全国 5,000 个学区的 [联邦支出计划](https://www.future-ed.org/financial-trends-in-local-schools-covid-aid-spending/) 表明，超过三分之一的学区打算将新的心理健康专业人员带入学校，约 30% 的学区计划资助社交情感学习工作 [FutureEd 的分析，](https://www.future-ed.org/local-covid-relief-spending/) 根据美国智库 乔治敦大学麦考特公共政策学院。

“This is an incredible increase in the amount of money being spent and the number of districts pursuing it,” Phyllis Jordan, associate director of FutureEd said. But it is still, advocates say, not nearly enough.

FutureEd 的副主任 Phyllis Jordan 说：“花费的金额和追求它的地区数量都出现了令人难以置信的增长。” 但支持者说，这还远远不够。

> “We simply don’t have enough people in our profession to meet the need.”

In many areas, even when money is in hand, hiring is not easy. As this school year opened, nearly 20 percent of schools reported vacancies in mental health positions, according to [federal data](https://ies.ed.gov/schoolsurvey/spp/). Schools often said they employed too few staff to manage the caseload but also complained about difficulties finding licensed providers, the data showed.

在许多地区，即使手头有钱，招聘也不容易。 ，随着本学年的开始，近 20% 的学校报告了心理健康职位的空缺 [根据联邦数据](https://ies.ed.gov/schoolsurvey/spp/) 。 数据显示，学校经常表示他们雇用的员工太少无法处理案件，但也抱怨难以找到有执照的供应商。

“We simply don’t have enough people in our profession to meet the need,” said Kelsey Theis, president of the Texas Association of School Psychologists. When families seek private therapists, “sometimes there’s a wait list of months and months before they get help,” she said.

“我们这个行业根本没有足够的人来满足需求，”德州学校心理学家协会主席凯尔西·泰斯 (Kelsey Theis) 说。 当家庭寻求私人治疗师时，“有时他们要等上好几个月才能得到帮助，”她说。

In Maine, waiting lists grew so long last year that school counselor Tara Kierstead began looking out of state for therapists who had openings — a solution that was not practical for many families.

在缅因州，等候名单去年变得如此之长，以至于学校辅导员塔拉·基尔斯特德 (Tara Kierstead) 开始到州外寻找有空缺的治疗师——这种解决方案对许多家庭来说并不实用。

“It was the hardest I’ve ever had to work to get resources to people,” Kierstead said. “I know some kids who were never seen.”

“这是我为人们获取资源所做的最艰苦的工作，”Kierstead 说。 “我认识一些从未见过的孩子。”

Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy called out the “devastating” effects of the pandemic on youth mental health in a public advisory last December. Earlier that year, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the Children’s Hospital Association [together declared “a national state of emergency” in children’s mental health](https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/17718?autologincheck=redirected?nfToken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000). They pointed out that young people of color were especially affected and linked the struggle for racial justice to the worsening crisis.

外科医生 Vivek H. Murthy 在去年 12 月的一次公共咨询中指出了这种流行病对青年心理健康的“毁灭性”影响。 那年早些时候，美国儿科学会、美国儿童和青少年精神病学学会和儿童医院协会 [共同宣布儿童心理健康“全国进入紧急状态”](https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/17718?autologincheck=redirected?nfToken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000) 。 他们指出，有色人种的年轻人尤其受到影响，并将争取种族正义的斗争与日益恶化的危机联系起来。

A year later, this October, [they sounded the alarm again](https://www.aap.org/en/advocacy/child-and-adolescent-healthy-mental-development/aap-aacap-cha-declaration-of-a-national-emergency-in-child-and-adolescent-mental-health/). Things are not getting better.

一年后的今年10月， [他们再次敲响了警钟](https://www.aap.org/en/advocacy/child-and-adolescent-healthy-mental-development/aap-aacap-cha-declaration-of-a-national-emergency-in-child-and-adolescent-mental-health/) 。 事情并没有好转。

不断加深的危机

Not long after the pandemic started, researchers began to document [declines in child and adolescent mental health](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7108e2.htm). The numbers are stark.

大流行开始后不久，研究人员开始记录 [儿童和青少年心理健康状况的下降](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7108e2.htm) 。 数字很明显。

Hospital emergency room visits spiked for suspected suicide attempts among girls ages 12 to 17, [according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7024e1.htm). From February to March 2021, the number jumped by 51 percent compared with the same period during 2019. For boys, the increase was 4 percent. Early research from [MIT suggested](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/newsroom/news/042722-COVID-adolescent-suicide) the suicide rate for people aged 10 to 19 increased in 2020, compared with before the pandemic. More recently, CDC provisional data for 2021 showed an increase in the national rate from 2020 to 2021[, especially for people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/09/29/suicide-increase-2021/?itid=lk_inline_manual_23) ages 15 to 24.

12 至 17 岁的女孩因疑似自杀未遂而去医院急诊室就诊的人数激增 [根据疾病控制和预防中心的数据，](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7024e1.htm) 。 从 2021 年 2 月到 2021 年 3 月，这一数字与 2019 年同期相比增长了 51%。对于男孩来说，增幅为 4%。 的早期研究 [麻省理工学院](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/newsroom/news/042722-COVID-adolescent-suicide) 表明，与大流行之前相比，2020 年 10 至 19 岁人群的自杀率有所上升。 最近，CDC 2021 年的临时数据显示，从 2020 年到 2021 年，全国的患病率有所上升 [，尤其是](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/09/29/suicide-increase-2021/?itid=lk_inline_manual_23) 15 至 24 岁的人群。

In other research, the CDC found nearly 45 percent of high school students were so persistently sad or hopeless in 2021 they were unable to engage in regular activities. Almost 1 in 5 seriously considered suicide, and 9 percent of the teenagers surveyed by the CDC tried to take their lives during the previous 12 months. A substantially larger percentage of gay, lesbian, bisexual, other and questioning students reported a suicide attempt.

在其他研究中，疾病预防控制中心发现近 45% 的高中生在 2021 年持续感到悲伤或绝望，以至于无法进行常规活动。 近五分之一的人认真考虑过自杀，CDC 调查的青少年中有 9% 在过去 12 个月内曾尝试结束自己的生命。 相当大比例的男同性恋、女同性恋、双性恋、 其他 和有疑问的学生报告了自杀未遂。

Family upheaval, meanwhile, was widespread, particularly in the early pandemic: [Nearly 30 percent of students](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/su/su7103a5.htm?s_cid=su7103a5_w) said an adult in their home had lost a job, and 24 percent said they went hungry for a lack of food.

与此同时，家庭动荡也很普遍，尤其是在大流行初期： [近 30% 的学生](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/su/su7103a5.htm?s_cid=su7103a5_w) 说他们家里的一个成年人失业了，24% 的学生说他们因缺乏食物而挨饿。

There are no directly comparable pre-pandemic studies, but Kathleen Ethier, the CDC’s director of the division of adolescent and school health, said student well-being is significantly better for [teens who report feeling connected](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0331-youth-mental-health-covid-19.html) to their schools — a problem for a population that, nationwide, was kept out of them for so long.

没有直接可比的大流行前研究，但 CDC 青少年和学校健康司司长 Kathleen Ethier 表示，对于 [那些报告感觉与](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0331-youth-mental-health-covid-19.html) 学校有联系的青少年来说，学生的幸福感要好得多——这对一个人口来说是个问题, 在全国范围内，被排除在他们之外这么久。

“There is 20 years of research showing that it not only has an impact on how young people do while they’re adolescents, but it has 20-year impacts on all kinds of measures of health,” including emotional well-being, suicidality and substance use, she said.

“20 年的研究表明，它不仅对青少年时期的行为有影响，而且对各种健康指标也有 20 年的影响，”包括情绪健康、自杀倾向和物质使用，她说。

It also left many children grieving. More [than 230,000 U.S. students](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/orphanhood_calculator/#/country/United%20States%20of%20America) under 18 are believed to be mourning the ultimate loss: the death of [a parent or primary caregiver](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/09/06/covid-deaths-orphans-worldwide/?itid=lk_inline_manual_29) in a pandemic-related loss, according to research [by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p1007-covid-19-orphaned-children.html), Imperial College London, Harvard University, Oxford University and the University of Cape Town. In the United States, children of color were hit the hardest, [another study found](https://www.covidcollaborative.us/initiatives/hidden-pain). It estimated that the loss for Black and Hispanic children was nearly twice the rate for White children.

这也让许多孩子感到悲痛。 超过 [230,000 名](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/orphanhood_calculator/#/country/United%20States%20of%20America) 18 岁以下的美国学生正在哀悼最终的损失： [的研究，父母或主要照顾者](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/09/06/covid-deaths-orphans-worldwide/?itid=lk_inline_manual_29) 在与大流行相关的损失中 [根据疾病预防控制中心](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p1007-covid-19-orphaned-children.html) 、伦敦帝国理工学院、哈佛大学、牛津大学和大学 死亡开普敦。 ，在美国，有色人种儿童受到的打击最为严重 [另一项研究发现](https://www.covidcollaborative.us/initiatives/hidden-pain) 。 据估计，黑人和西班牙裔儿童的损失率几乎是白人儿童的两倍。

Too much need, too little help

需要太多，帮助太少

In Maryland, Julia Horton, 16, recalls that, as her struggles worsened last year, she fell asleep in class a lot and did not turn in work; her grades dropped. Looking back, she said, “it is very obvious it was a cry for help.” Some teachers were compassionate, but others less so. “A lot of teachers talk about understanding mental illness, but they don’t act upon it,” she said.

在马里兰州，16 岁的朱莉娅·霍顿 (Julia Horton) 回忆说，随着去年她的病情恶化，她经常在课堂上睡着，也没有去上班； 她的成绩下降了。 回想起来，她说，“很明显那是求救声。” 有些老师很有同情心，有些则不那么富有同情心。 “很多老师都在谈论了解精神疾病，但他们并没有付诸行动，”她说。

Her school in suburban Montgomery County had two mental health professionals within its wellness center, county officials said, but Horton — like many students — had no idea. She talked to a counselor she liked about getting more time for assignments but it did not help. Her mother ultimately found her an excellent therapist to help Horton with her depression and anxiety, but she wonders about other teens who may not be as fortunate.

县官员说，她所在的学校位于蒙哥马利县郊区 ，其健康中心内有两名心理健康专家，但霍顿和许多学生一样，对此一无所知。 她和一位她喜欢的辅导员谈过要为作业争取更多时间，但没有帮助。 她的母亲最终为她找到了一位出色的治疗师，可以帮助霍顿缓解她的抑郁和焦虑，但她想知道其他可能没有这么幸运的青少年。

Montgomery County school officials said they inform students about mental health services through community messages, their website, student forums and advisory period lessons — though school board member Lynne Harris said messaging should be more robust and focused on platforms students use most.

蒙哥马利县学校官员表示，他们通过社区信息、网站、学生论坛和咨询期课程向学生宣传心理健康服务——尽管学校董事会成员琳恩·哈里斯 (Lynne Harris) 表示，信息传递应该更加强大，并专注于学生最常使用的平台。

In Philadelphia, Mikayla Jones, then 15, took care of her father in spring 2020 when he caught covid-19 and she had little contact with teachers and friends during remote learning. She wanted to talk to a therapist, but her mother couldn’t find one with an opening and she’d never heard of any mental health specialist at school. “I feel like this should not be something that’s possible,” she said. Now a 17-year-old senior, Jones is starting a club to advocate for mental health support across Philadelphia’s schools. “All youth deserve someone to be there for them.”

在费城，当时 15 岁的米凯拉·琼斯在 2020 年春天照顾她的父亲，当时他感染了 covid-19，在远程学习期间她几乎没有与老师和朋友联系。 她想找一位治疗师谈谈，但她的母亲找不到合适的人选，而且她在学校也从未听说过任何心理健康专家。 “我觉得这不应该是可能的，”她说。 琼斯现在是一名 17 岁的高年级学生，他正在创办一个俱乐部，倡导在费城的学校中提供心理健康支持。 “所有的年轻人都应该有人在他们身边。”

Philadelphia officials said counselors were meeting with students virtually or in person during the pandemic to assess their needs and help decide next steps. Still, the high school senior never found a therapist. The first meeting of her mental health support club will be later this month.

费城官员表示，在大流行期间，辅导员通过虚拟方式或亲自与学生会面，以评估他们的需求并帮助决定下一步行动。 尽管如此，这位高中生从未找到治疗师。 她的心理健康支持俱乐部的第一次会议将于本月晚些时候举行。

Told about the school system’s comment, the teenager said: “If the school does not communicate the availability of counselors, and their role as counselor has been repeatedly labeled as ‘college counselor,’ then how will we know that they are there as a mental health resource?”

谈到学校系统的评论，这名少年说：“如果学校不传达辅导员的可用性，并且他们作为辅导员的角色一再被贴上‘大学辅导员’的标签，那么我们怎么知道他们在那里作为心理咨询师健康资源？”

Shortages of mental health professionals have been [the norm in schools](https://www.nasponline.org/about-school-psychology/state-shortages-data-dashboard). Professional organizations recommend one school psychologist per 500 students, but the national average is [one per 1,160 students](https://www.nasponline.org/about-school-psychology/state-shortages-data-dashboard), with some states approaching one per 5,000. Similarly, the recommended [ratio of one school counselor per 250](https://www.schoolcounselor.org/getmedia/238f136e-ec52-4bf2-94b6-f24c39447022/Ratios-20-21-Alpha.pdf) students is not widespread. The national average: one per 415 students.

已 [精神卫生专业人员短缺在学校](https://www.nasponline.org/about-school-psychology/state-shortages-data-dashboard) 成为常态。 专业组织建议每 500 名学生一名学校心理学家，但全国平均水平是 [每 1,160 名学生一名](https://www.nasponline.org/about-school-psychology/state-shortages-data-dashboard) ，有些州接近每 5,000 名学生一名。 同样， [配备一名学校辅导员的建议比例](https://www.schoolcounselor.org/getmedia/238f136e-ec52-4bf2-94b6-f24c39447022/Ratios-20-21-Alpha.pdf) 每 250名学生 并不普遍。 全国平均水平：每 415 名学生一人。

[National research from 2019](https://edtrust.org/resource/school-counselors-matter/) showed that students of color have not received equal access to school counselors. At that time, 38 states were shortchanging students of color, students from low-income families or both, according to [the study](https://edtrust.org/resource/school-counselors-matter/) done by the Education Trust.

[2019 年的国家研究](https://edtrust.org/resource/school-counselors-matter/) 表明，有色人种学生没有平等获得学校辅导员的机会。 ，当时有 38 个州在欺骗有色人种学生、低收入家庭学生或两者兼而有之。 [的研究](https://edtrust.org/resource/school-counselors-matter/) 根据Education Trust 所做

As the pandemic has persisted, students have spoken out — in [Nebraska](https://omaha.com/news/local/education/losing-too-many-youth-mental-health-suicide-prevention-summit-draws-300-students/article_268afe90-53b9-11ed-a7c6-dfbba8ef9a0e.html), Arizona, [Connecticut](https://www.newhavenindependent.org/article/new_haven_students_walk_out) and Washington.

随着大流行的持续， [内布拉斯加州](https://omaha.com/news/local/education/losing-too-many-youth-mental-health-suicide-prevention-summit-draws-300-students/article_268afe90-53b9-11ed-a7c6-dfbba8ef9a0e.html) 、亚利桑那州、 [康涅狄格州](https://www.newhavenindependent.org/article/new_haven_students_walk_out) 和华盛顿的学生们纷纷发声。

In Seattle, students who formed the Seattle Student Union to promote racial justice decided this year to push for mental health support in schools. Chetan Soni, a 17-year-old who co-founded the union, said there are too few mental health professionals to meet rising student needs. The district told him it doesn’t have the money, he said.

在西雅图，成立西雅图学生会以促进种族公正的学生今年决定在学校推动心理健康支持。 该工会的联合创始人、17 岁的 Chetan Soni 说，精神卫生专业人员太少，无法满足学生不断增长的需求。 他说，学区告诉他没有钱。

Seattle teachers, who went on strike in September, included a call for more mental health support for students as one of their bargaining points. The strike settlement included part-time social workers at most schools — a sign of progress, Soni said, but not enough to help all. “Students are suffering from the pandemic and so many other things too,” he said.

9 月举行罢工的西雅图教师将呼吁为学生提供更多心理健康支持作为他们的谈判要点之一。 罢工协议包括大多数学校的兼职社会工作者——这是进步的迹象，索尼说，但还不足以帮助所有人。 “学生们正遭受着大流行病和许多其他事情的折磨，”他说。

His school, Lincoln High, is fortunate in having a school-based health clinic, run by Neighborcare Health. But just one therapist works there, said Rachel Gordon, the company’s school-based mental health clinical manager. Nearly all therapists based at Seattle’s schools have full caseloads and wait lists, Gordon said. Many run group therapy sessions as a way to serve more students. “We’ve seen increases in anxiety, disordered eating, suicidal ideation, OCD and many other mental health challenges,” she said.

他的学校 Lincoln High 幸运地拥有一家由 Neighborcare Health 运营的校内健康诊所。 但只有一名治疗师在那里工作，该公司的学校心理健康临床经理雷切尔戈登说。 戈登说，西雅图学校几乎所有的治疗师都有满满的病例和等候名单。 许多举办团体治疗会议是为了服务更多学生。 “我们已经看到焦虑、饮食失调、自杀意念、强迫症和许多其他心理健康挑战的增加，”她说。

In rural Montana, the squeeze was different: Altacare, a for-profit provider, decided to halt services in the state this year amid recruitment difficulties and funding issues. Districts scrambled to cover for the loss, but many could not, and state officials were limited in what they could do. “Unfortunately, they were serving a lot of the very small rural schools that were already struggling,” said Mary Windecker, executive director of the nonprofit Behavioral Health Alliance of Montana.

在蒙大拿州的农村地区，压力有所不同：营利性提供商 Altacare 今年因招聘困难和资金问题决定停止在该州提供服务。 各地区争先恐后地弥补损失，但许多地区无能为力，州政府官员能做的也很有限。 “不幸的是，他们为许多已经在苦苦挣扎的非常小的农村学校提供服务，”蒙大拿州非营利行为健康联盟的执行董事玛丽温德克说。

The shortages meant that Montana kids who needed residential care, for the most serious mental illnesses, were mostly being sent to other states, she said. “Not because we don’t have beds for those children but because we don’t have people to staff those kids,” she said. “Imagine a six-year-old with a serious emotional disturbance being sent as far away as Georgia. That’s happening.”

她说，短缺意味着蒙大拿州因患有最严重的 精神疾病而需要寄宿照料的孩子大多被送往其他州。 “不是因为我们没有床位给那些孩子，而是因为我们没有人照顾这些孩子，”她说。 “想象一下，一个患有严重情绪障碍的 6 岁儿童被送到远在格鲁吉亚的地方。 这正在发生。”

One result of all these deficiencies: More students are acting out. Last school year, [nearly 40 percent of schools nationally reported](https://ies.ed.gov/schoolsurvey/spp/) increases in physical attacks or fights, and roughly 60 percent reported more disruptions in class because of student misconduct, according to federal data. [Las Vegas officials reported several alarming attacks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/05/21/school-violence-las-vegas-teachers/?itid=lk_inline_manual_47) on teachers.

争先恐后的解决方案

School administrators across the country are clear-eyed about students’ worsening mental health, many of them strategizing about school initiatives that might help.

全国各地的学校管理人员对学生日益恶化的心理健康状况一清二楚，他们中的许多人都在制定可能有所帮助的学校举措。

“We know that when kids are mentally well, they’re much more likely to attend school and do well in school,” said Sharon Hoover, co-director of the National Center for School Mental Health.

“我们知道，当孩子精神健康时，他们就更有可能上学并在学校表现良好，”国家学校心理健康中心联合主任莎伦胡佛说。

In Maryland’s Montgomery County, the state’s largest school system has expanded [school-based wellness centers](https://mcpsmd.new.swagit.com/videos/180121) that provide mental health services: Five are open, a sixth will debut in January and 19 others are being phased in.

在马里兰州的蒙哥马利县，该州最大的学校系统扩大 [了提供心理健康服务的校本健康中心](https://mcpsmd.new.swagit.com/videos/180121) ：五个开放，第六个将于 1 月首次亮相，另外 19 个正在分阶段投入使用。

In Georgia, [Hawaii](https://www.govtech.com/education/k-12/hawaii-k-12-schools-to-implement-telehealth-statewide) and a host of other states, schools rely on telehealth services to help meet the gap. [They often involve contractors](https://medcitynews.com/2022/10/hazel-health-raises-51-5m-to-scale-school-based-telehealth/) — such as [Hazel Health](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hazel-health-accelerates-growth-to-over-3-000-schools-in-14-states-secures-series-c1-funding-301660664.html) — that respond to referrals from teachers, school counselors or parents; services are often covered through government funding or payer reimbursements.

在 佐治亚州、 [夏威夷州](https://www.govtech.com/education/k-12/hawaii-k-12-schools-to-implement-telehealth-statewide) 和许多其他州，学校依靠远程医疗服务来帮助弥补差距。 [它们通常涉及承包商](https://medcitynews.com/2022/10/hazel-health-raises-51-5m-to-scale-school-based-telehealth/) ——例如 [Hazel Health——](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hazel-health-accelerates-growth-to-over-3-000-schools-in-14-states-secures-series-c1-funding-301660664.html) 响应教师、学校辅导员或家长的推荐； 服务通常 通过政府资助或付款人报销来支付。

Some school systems have adopted [student mental health “check-ins”](https://www.kut.org/education/2022-09-02/as-school-starts-teachers-add-a-mental-health-check-in-to-their-lesson-plans) to get a quick read on student well-being. Others created calming rooms for students or found ways to build mindfulness, yoga or meditation into student life.

一些学校系统已经采用 [学生心理健康“登记”](https://www.kut.org/education/2022-09-02/as-school-starts-teachers-add-a-mental-health-check-in-to-their-lesson-plans) 来快速了解学生的健康状况。 其他人为学生创造了平静的房间，或者找到了将正念、瑜伽或冥想融入学生生活的方法。

A growing number of schools now offer therapy. Many have forged partnerships with community providers who treat students in person on campus. Health or wellness centers that are located inside of schools numbered roughly 3,000 before the pandemic.

现在越来越多的学校提供治疗。 许多人与社区提供者建立了合作伙伴关系，这些提供者亲自在校园内接待学生。 在大流行之前，位于学校内的健康或保健中心大约有 3,000 个。

“School-based health centers fill a void, particularly in low-income communities,” said Robert Boyd, chief executive at the nonprofit School-Based Health Alliance. “In rural communities, sometimes it’s the only provider around.”

“校本健康中心填补了空白，尤其是在低收入社区，”非营利性校本健康联盟的首席执行官罗伯特博伊德说。 “在农村社区，有时它是唯一的供应商。”

More broadly, school systems are expanding [social-emotional learning](https://omaha.com/news/local/education/nebraska-schools-using-federal-covid-relief-to-invest-in-social-emotional-learning/article_643c14a2-3845-11ed-a884-7f1ff60baac6.html) intended to help students understand and regulate their emotions, develop positive relationships and face challenges. These lessons may be embedded in classes (say, a discussion of empathy related to characters in a novel) or they may come directly through an activity about, for instance, decision-making. In some parts of the country, social-emotional teaching is [tangled up in the culture wars](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/03/28/social-emotional-learning-critical-race-theory/?itid=lk_inline_manual_61), particularly when material deals with gender and racial equity.

更广泛地说，学校系统正在扩大 [社交情感学习](https://omaha.com/news/local/education/nebraska-schools-using-federal-covid-relief-to-invest-in-social-emotional-learning/article_643c14a2-3845-11ed-a884-7f1ff60baac6.html) ，旨在帮助学生理解和调节他们的情绪，发展积极的关系 并面对挑战。 这些课程可能嵌入课堂（例如，讨论与小说中的人物相关的同理心），或者它们可能直接来自有关决策的活动。 在该国的某些地区，社会情感教学 [与文化战争纠缠在一起](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/03/28/social-emotional-learning-critical-race-theory/?itid=lk_inline_manual_61) ，特别是当材料涉及性别和种族平等时。

In California’s Natomas School District, Superintendent Chris Evans brought in an administrator with mental health expertise seven years before the pandemic. Each school already had a psychologist. But as the pandemic began, social workers were hired for each school, too — a decision that no one regretted. “About one in every two of our students,” Evans said, “accessed some form of mental health resource.” Suicide assessments more than doubled last year, to 191, compared with 71 before the pandemic.

在加利福尼亚州的纳托马斯学区，学监克里斯·埃文斯 (Chris Evans) 在大流行发生七年前就聘请了一位具有心理健康专业知识的管理人员。 每所学校都已经有一名心理学家。 但随着大流行开始，每所学校也聘请了社会工作者—— 这一决定没有人后悔。 “大约每两个学生中就有一个，”埃文斯说，“获得了某种形式的心理健康资源。” 与大流行前的 71 相比，去年的自杀评估增加了一倍多，达到 191。

A big worry in many areas is what happens when federal aid runs out. The school board in Natomas voted this spring to retain the new hires even after the money is gone, Evans said.

许多地区的一个大问题是当联邦援助用完时会发生什么。 埃文斯说，今年春天，纳托马斯的学校董事会投票决定，即使在钱花光后也能保留新员工。

Other efforts flowed from legislation. At least 12 states have adopted some form of “mental health days,” which excuse student absences for mental health purposes. In Illinois, [students are now allowed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/parenting/2022/09/30/school-mental-health-day-advice/?itid=lk_inline_manual_65) five days per year under a new measure approved by the [legislature](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=1577&GAID=16&DocTypeID=SB&SessionID=110&GA=102).

其他努力源于立法。 至少有 12 个州采用了某种形式的“心理健康日”，为学生的心理健康目的免除缺勤。 在伊利诺伊州， [批准的一项新措施，学生现在](https://www.washingtonpost.com/parenting/2022/09/30/school-mental-health-day-advice/?itid=lk_inline_manual_65) 每年可以有五天的 [根据立法机关](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocNum=1577&GAID=16&DocTypeID=SB&SessionID=110&GA=102) 学习时间。

Critics see the excused days off as counterproductive for students who have already missed too much school, but supporters say the laws recognize the stressful reality of many students’ lives and elevate the stature of mental health so that it is comparable to physical health.

批评者认为请假对已经缺课太多的学生来说适得其反，但支持者表示，法律承认许多学生生活压力大的现实，并提升心理健康的地位，使其与身体健康相当。

Twenty states also require mental health education in schools — which Barb Solish, director of youth and young adult initiatives with the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said will reduce stigma and increase literacy so students recognize symptoms and learn how to get help for themselves or their friends.

20 个州还要求在学校开展心理健康教育——全国心理疾病联盟青年和青年倡议主任 Barb Solish 表示，这将减少耻辱感并提高识字率，以便学生识别症状并学习如何为自己或他们的孩子寻求帮助朋友们。

Mental health in schools is expected to get a big boost, too, Solish said, from the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, [which allots more than $1 billion over five years](https://www.nami.org/Press-Media/Press-Releases/2022/NAMI-Statement-on-Mental-Health-Investments-in-Bipartisan-Senate-Legislation#:~:text=%E2%80%9CNAMI%20applauds%20the%20work%20of,health%20care%20across%20the%20country.) to support school-based mental health services. More than $500 million is slated for a grant program to hire and retain providers in schools, and another $500 million is for building a pipeline of future professionals.

索利什说，随着两党安全社区法案的通过，预计学校的心理健康也会得到很大的推动，该法案 [在五年内拨款超过 10 亿美元](https://www.nami.org/Press-Media/Press-Releases/2022/NAMI-Statement-on-Mental-Health-Investments-in-Bipartisan-Senate-Legislation#:~:text=%E2%80%9CNAMI%20applauds%20the%20work%20of,health%20care%20across%20the%20country.) 用于支持学校心理健康服务。 超过 5 亿美元将用于聘用和留住学校供应商的拨款计划，另外 5 亿美元将用于培养未来的专业人员。

号召做更多

Riana Alexander, right, speaks next to Elle Mramor. “Mental health is hard,” Alexander said told those gathered. “It’s hard to talk about it, it’s hard to struggle with it, it’s hard to open up about it.” (Caitlin O’Hara for The Washington Post)

Riana Alexander and other students in Chandler, Ariz., showed up at school board meetings for several months, distressed about the string of suicides that left three 15-year-olds dead. At a [meeting in June](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMeSsS45sac), many of them acknowledged their own mental health difficulties as they pressed the school district to do more.

亚利桑那州钱德勒的 Riana Alexander 和其他学生出现了几个月的学校董事会会议，对导致三名 15 岁青少年死亡的一系列自杀事件感到痛心。 在 [6 月的一次会议上](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMeSsS45sac) ，他们中的许多人在敦促学区做更多事情时承认了自己的心理健康问题。

The [father of a teen who took his life joined them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMeSsS45sac), his voice breaking in grief. “I don’t have the answers,” he said. He vowed to work with the students as they seek change and called them brave.

一个自杀的少年的 [父亲加入了他们](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMeSsS45sac) 的行列，他的声音因悲伤而破碎。 “我没有答案，”他说。 他发誓要在学生们寻求改变时与他们一起工作，并称他们为勇敢者。

Then his voice stiffened.

然后他的声音僵硬了。

“It’s a shame they have to come in here and ask for this,” he said.

“很遗憾他们必须来这里要求这个，”他说。

Two months later, another teenager took her life. She was 16. School had been open less than three weeks.

两个月后，另一个少年夺走了她的生命。 她当时 16 岁。学校开学还不到三个星期。

Sofia Borczon, 15, an organizer with Arizona Students for Mental Health, said she has struggled with her mental health for four years. “This is a crisis. Kids are dying — and they have been for years,” she said. (Caitlin O’Hara for The Washington Post)

“This is a crisis,” Sofia Borczon, a 10th-grader, told the board at another meeting. She’d had mental health struggles for four years, she said, and never felt there were necessary resources. “Kids are dying — and they have been for years.”

“这是一场危机，”十年级学生 Sofia Borczon 在另一次会议上告诉董事会。 她说，她已经有四年的心理健康斗争，并且从未觉得有必要的资源。 “孩子们正在死去——而且他们已经死了很多年。”

She and others — part of Arizona Students for Mental Health, which was founded by Alexander — asked for mental health “first-aid training,” so that everyone would know more about how to help kids in need, and for “student action boards” to elevate mental health concerns at schools. They wanted to lead a town hall meeting, so their peers could be heard too.

她和其他人——由亚历山大创立的亚利桑那心理健康学生组织的成员——要求进行心理健康“急救培训”，以便每个人都能更多地了解如何帮助有需要的孩子，以及“学生行动委员会”提高学校的心理健康问题。 他们想主持一次市政厅会议，这样他们的同龄人也能听到他们的声音。

Chandler officials told The Washington Post the requests either take time to implement or might conflict with best practices. Eventually, Chandler’s prevention coordinator started to meet with the students, and the school system held a mental health [event in October](https://www.cusd80.com/site/Default.aspx?PageID=6390&PageType=17&DomainID=913&ModuleInstanceID=6869&EventDateID=798645), with speakers and resource information.

钱德勒官员告诉《华盛顿邮报》，这些要求要么需要时间来实施，要么可能与最佳做法相冲突。 最终，钱德勒的预防协调员开始与学生会面，学校系统 [在 10 月举行了一场心理健康活动](https://www.cusd80.com/site/Default.aspx?PageID=6390&PageType=17&DomainID=913&ModuleInstanceID=6869&EventDateID=798645) ，有演讲者和资源信息。

Chandler schools spokeswoman Stephanie Ingersoll said the district has suicide prevention training for all teachers and staff, going beyond what is required by the state. At a meeting in August, the school system outlined a list of other initiatives. The district plans to begin teen mental health first aid training, but only for students 15 and older who have parental consent, Ingersoll said, and offers mental health first aid for staff within its training department. “We hope there is an understanding that implementing anything new takes time,” she said in an email.

钱德勒学校女发言人斯蒂芬妮·英格索尔表示，该学区对所有教职工进行了自杀预防培训，这超出了该州的要求。 在 8 月的一次会议上，学校系统概述了一系列其他举措。 Ingersoll 说，该地区计划开始青少年心理健康急救培训，但仅限于 15 岁及以上且获得父母同意的学生，并为其培训部门的工作人员提供心理健康急救。 “我们希望大家理解，实施任何新事物都需要时间，”她在一封电子邮件中说。

Alexander said the school system’s recent efforts are a step forward, but lack urgency and are not enough. She and others testified before a state committee on teen mental health.

亚历山大说，学校系统最近的努力是向前迈出的一步，但缺乏紧迫感，而且还不够。 她和其他人在州青少年心理健康委员会作证。

In September, the students gathered with classmates for a Saturday evening vigil to remember students who died recently by suicide and those who preceded them. It was World Suicide Prevention Day — a month after the most recent Chandler student took her life.

9 月，学生们与同学们聚集在一起参加周六晚上的守夜活动，以纪念最近死于自杀的学生和先于他们的学生。 那天是世界预防自杀日——最近一名钱德勒学生结束了她的生命一个月后。

“Mental health is hard,” Alexander told those gathered. “It’s hard to talk about it, it’s hard to struggle with it, it’s hard to open up about it. But struggling in silence isn’t the way and it’s not the answer. There are people out there who have gone through or are currently going through exactly what you are. There are people out there who love you and there are people out there who care about you.”

“心理健康很难，”亚历山大告诉聚集的人。 “很难谈论它，很难与之抗争，很难敞开心扉。 但默默地挣扎不是办法，也不是答案。 有些人已经或正在经历你的真实经历。 那里有爱你的人，也有关心你的人。”
