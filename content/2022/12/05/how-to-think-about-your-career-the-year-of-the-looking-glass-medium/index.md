## 如何思考你的职业生涯

If you had asked 22-year-old me what my “career aspirations” were, I would have looked at you blankly and then casually changed the subject to what programs you’d recommend to model cute 3D bunnies for a video game, or whether the writers of [_Alias_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_%28TV_series%29) would be so devious as to ship Sydney Bristow and Sark.

如果你问 22 岁的我我的“职业抱负”是什么，我会茫然地看着你，然后随意地把话题转到你推荐什么程序来为电子游戏制作可爱的 3D 兔子模型，或者是否 的作者 [_Alias_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_%28TV_series%29) 会如此狡猾，以至于运送 Sydney Bristow 和 Sark。

It’s not that I didn’t think about my career at all. I was ambitious — I wanted to be a part of something big. I wanted to be able to support myself financially and not worry my parents (as this was a high bar set at doctor, aka the “stablest of all professions,” I suspect they still secretly worry about this.) I wanted the kind of job where I wouldn’t be watching the clock every hour, daydreaming like [Rebecca Black about Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0).

这并不是说我根本没有考虑过我的职业生涯。 我雄心勃勃——我想成为大事的一部分。 我希望能够在经济上养活自己而不用担心我的父母（因为这是医生的高门槛，也就是“所有职业中最稳定的”，我怀疑他们仍然暗中担心这个。）我想要那种工作在那里我不会每小时都看时钟，像 [Rebecca Black 一样在星期五](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0) 做白日梦。

But beyond that, the specifics of “thinking about my career” was a giant grey cloud to me. It felt almost icky to be too career-oriented, like if you were, you were that kind of self-absorbed person constantly trying to game the system by sugar-coating the things you said to your bosses. Besides, at 22, I had taken my first job at a start-up where we were moving way too fast to sit down and idly contemplate the skills we hoped to learn. Who needs career conversations when you’re busy changing the world?

但除此之外，“思考我的职业生涯”的细节对我来说是一个巨大的乌云。 太以职业为导向几乎让人感到恶心，如果你是，你就是那种自我吸收的人，不断地试图通过给你对老板说的话涂糖衣来玩弄这个系统。 此外，在 22 岁时，我在一家初创公司找到了第一份工作，我们的发展速度太快了，无法坐下来无所事事地思考我们希望学习的技能。 当您忙于改变世界时，谁需要职业对话？

Here’s the thing though: your career, like your life, moves forward whether you think about it or not. If you don’t think about it, then you’re putting faith in the winds. Maybe you’ll end up somewhere you’ve always wanted to go. Maybe not. Why take that chance when you can captain your own sails?

事情是这样的：不管你想不想，你的事业就像你的生活一样向前发展。 如果您不考虑它，那么您就是在相信风。 也许你最终会到达你一直想去的地方。 也许不吧。 当您可以自己航行时，为什么要抓住这个机会呢？

Here’s what I wish I had known about getting a handle on my career earlier in life:

以下是我希望我在早年掌握我的职业生涯时就知道的事情：

## Your career is defined by your skills and how you’ve used them, not by any external measure of your progress.

## 你的职业是由你的技能和你如何使用它们来定义的，而不是由你进步的任何外部衡量标准来定义的。

It’s common to think of your career as your level within the company, or how much money you make, or your title, or whether you were included in some prestigious group (a meeting of importance, an exclusive conference, a list of N under N, an award recipient, etc.)

人们通常认为你的职业是你在公司的级别，或者你赚了多少钱，或者你的头衔，或者你是否被包括在某个有声望的团体中（重要的会议，独家会议，N 下的 N 的列表、获奖者等）

Often, I hear people say things like, “I’m interested in advancing my career. What do I need to do to get promoted?”

我经常听到人们说这样的话，“我有兴趣提升我的职业生涯。 我需要做什么才能升职？”

This is a perfectly valid question to ask, but I suspect what lurks beneath the question is the assumption that _advancing one’s career_ = _getting a promotion_. I contest this quite heavily. In my opinion, it’s like equating _being a good friend_ with _getting invited to friend’s wedding_.

这是一个完全正确的问题，但我怀疑这个问题背后隐藏的是 _推进一个人的职业生涯_ \= _获得晋升_ 的假设。 我非常反对这一点。 在我看来，这就像把 _成为好朋友_ 等同于 _被邀请参加朋友的婚礼_ 。

Certainly, the people who attend someone’s wedding are likely to be good friends. But you wouldn’t think that optimizing for getting an invitation to a wedding is the right way to go about being a good friend. In fact, it’s entirely the other way around. If you focus 100% on being a great friend to someone, even if you never once thought about being invited to their wedding, guess what. You’re probably going to get that fancy envelope in the mail.

当然，参加某人婚礼的人很可能是好朋友。 但是你不会认为优化获得婚礼邀请是成为好朋友的正确方式。 事实上，情况完全相反。 如果你 100% 专注于成为某人的好朋友，即使你从未想过被邀请参加他们的婚礼，你猜怎么着。 您可能会在邮件中收到那个精美的信封。

The same is true regarding your career. If you focus exclusively on improving your skills and your impact to your organization (or to the world at large), the promotions, raises and accolades tend to come as a byproduct.

你的职业也是如此。 如果你只专注于提高你的技能和你对你的组织（或整个世界）的影响，那么晋升、加薪和荣誉往往会作为副产品出现。

The reverse isn’t true. As an extreme analogy, you might have a terrible boss who tells you the way to get a promotion is to shut your mouth, fetch her coffee every morning, and do any busywork she assigns you. Now, maybe you check off these boxes and get a promotion. Cool. But would doing this actually help you in the long run? Would doing this teach you new skills and make you a more attractive hire for some other company down the line? Probably not. Maybe what happens is that you rise in the ranks of that company only to have it go bankrupt later on. (Hey, this isn’t unreasonable given the organization seems to possess questionable management practices). Post-bankruptcy, you realize you don’t have many marketable skills in this rapidly-changing economy, so it’s hard to get a job at a similar comfort level to what you had. Life sucks. You get bitter.

反之则不然。 举个极端的比喻，你可能有一个糟糕的老板，他告诉你获得晋升的方法就是闭上嘴，每天早上给她拿咖啡，然后做她分配给你的任何忙碌的工作。 现在，也许您勾选了这些方框并获得了晋升。 凉爽的。 但从长远来看，这样做真的对你有帮助吗？ 这样做会教给你新技能并让你成为其他公司更有吸引力的雇员吗？ 可能不是。 也许发生的事情是你在那家公司的职位上升只是为了让它后来破产。 （嘿，鉴于该组织似乎拥有可疑的管理实践，这并非不合理）。 破产后，您意识到在这个瞬息万变的经济环境中，您没有太多适销对路的技能，因此很难找到一份与您所拥有的舒适水平相似的工作。 生活糟透了。 你变得苦涩。

So don’t ask “What does it take to get a promotion?” Ask instead: “How can I be doing more to help make our customers (or would-be customers) happy?” Ask “What skills should I be developing to help me increase my impact?”

所以不要问“升职需要什么？” 而是问：“我怎样才能做更多的事情来帮助我们的客户（或潜在客户）开心？” 问“我应该培养哪些技能来帮助我增加影响力？”

Even if your current company has a broken promotion system, even if your company collapses tomorrow due to the winds of ill fortune, even if every external measure you hold yourself to — title, salary, affiliation, awards — goes out the window, your skills are forever. Nobody can take those away from you. No matter where you journey, your skills and your past experiences go along for the ride. This is why you shouldn’t worry too much if your career doesn’t follow some up-and-up external ladder structure. Are there instances where a new role with a pay cut and a title downgrade might unlock a treasure trove of new learnings and opportunities? Of course. Might you be better off in 10 years if you take a smaller position at a faster-growing company? [Just ask Sheryl Sandberg](http://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2013/03/14/why-a-career-jungle-gym-is-better-than-a-career-ladder/#ea1e02195bdb).

即使你现在的公司有一个破烂的晋升系统，即使你的公司明天因厄运而倒闭，即使你坚持自己的每一项外部衡量标准——头衔、薪水、从属关系、奖励——都失效了，你的技能是永远的。 没有人能把这些从你身边夺走。 无论您在哪里旅行，您的技能和过去的经验都会伴随您前进。 这就是为什么如果您的职业生涯不遵循某种向上向上的外部阶梯结构，您不必太担心。 是否存在减薪和降级的新角色可能会解锁新知识和机会的宝库？ 当然。 如果你在一家发展更快的公司担任较小的职位，你是否会在 10 年后过得更好？ [问问谢丽尔·桑德伯格 (Sheryl Sandberg) 就知道了](http://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2013/03/14/why-a-career-jungle-gym-is-better-than-a-career-ladder/#ea1e02195bdb) 。

Careers are long, so invest into them where it counts.

职业生涯很长，所以在重要的地方投资。

## **Treat your manager as a coach, not as a judge.**

## **把你的经理当作教练，而不是法官。**

For most of my career, I had the mental model that my manager, like my teachers and professors of the past, was someone in a position of authority who took note of what I did and passed judgement on it. They determined whether I was or wasn’t doing well, what I needed more critical feedback on, and what letter grade or assessment I deserved.

在我职业生涯的大部分时间里，我的心智模型是我的经理，就像我过去的老师和教授一样，是一个处于权威地位的人，他会注意到我的所作所为并对其做出判断。 他们确定我做得好还是不好，我需要更多批评性反馈，以及我应得的字母等级或评估。

As such, my modus operandi for interacting with my manager could be summarized in one neat statement: _don’t come across as an idiot_.

因此，我与经理互动的作案手法可以用一句话概括： _不要给人留下白痴的印象_ 。

This meant that I’d try and act as if I had my shit together in front of him or her. I’d exude confidence and optimism, even when I wasn’t feeling it. I’d say “Oh, I’ve got it under control,” when they asked if I needed help with anything. There was no clearer evidence of personal failure than if my manager had to get involved in something I was responsible for. I read it as a neon sign brightly flashing _Warning:_ _employee not competent enough to take care of this task on her own._

这意味着我会尝试在他或她面前表现得好像我的狗屎一样。 我会散发出自信和乐观，即使我没有感觉到。 当他们问我是否需要任何帮助时，我会说“哦，我已经控制住了”。 没有比我的经理不得不参与我负责的事情更清楚的个人失败证据了。 我把它读作一个霓虹灯闪烁的 _警告：_ _员工没有足够的能力独自完成这项任务。_

It wasn’t until I had managed for many years myself that this mindset began to change.

直到我自己管理了很多年，这种心态才开始改变。

Look, your manager’s job (assuming she is a good manager) is to help you and the rest of your team get better results. From this perspective, it is completely logical that she should be invested in your career. When you do better, then by extension, she does better. Hence, your manager is someone who is on your side, who wants you to succeed, and who is willing to spend a good deal of time and energy to help you do that.

你看，你的经理的工作（假设她是一位优秀的经理）是帮助你和你团队的其他成员取得更好的结果。 从这个角度来看，她应该投资于你的事业是完全合乎逻辑的。 当你做得更好时，推而广之，她也会做得更好。 因此，你的经理是站在你这边的人，他希望你成功，并且愿意花费大量时间和精力来帮助你做到这一点。

Can you imagine a star athlete trying to hide their weaknesses in front of their coach? Would you tell your personal trainer, “Oh, I’m pretty fit, I’ve got it under control” when she asks you how she can help you achieve a better workout? Of course not. That is not how a coaching relationship works.

你能想象一个明星运动员试图在教练面前隐藏自己的弱点吗？ 当你的私人教练问你如何帮助你更好地锻炼时，你会告诉她“哦，我很健康，我已经控制住了”吗？ 当然不是。 这不是教练关系的运作方式。

It’s precisely because I didn’t see my manager as a coach that I missed out on years of asking for and receiving training and feedback that would have helped me become better faster. Yes, of course, your manager still plays the role of judge. Yes, she can (and should) fire you if you can’t do the job, or do nothing but play Pokemon Go all day. But assuming you’re not unqualified or lazy or an asshole (and trust me, if you were, you’d know quite quickly), then your manager would like nothing better than for your career to be on a rocket-ship trajectory to the moon.

正是因为我没有将我的经理视为教练，所以我错过了多年寻求和接受培训和反馈的机会，这些培训和反馈可以帮助我更快地变得更好。 是的，当然，你的经理仍然扮演着法官的角色。 是的，如果你不能胜任这份工作，她可以（也应该）解雇你，或者除了整天玩 Pokemon Go 什么都不做。 但假设你不是不合格、懒惰或混蛋（相信我，如果你是，你很快就会知道），那么你的经理最希望你的职业生涯像火箭一样飞速发展月亮。

You don’t just need coaching when you’re struggling. I’m willing to bet that everyone who’ll take home gold at Rio will have a coach. A majority of them will probably credit good coaching as a critical factor in getting them to where they are.

当你挣扎时，你不仅需要指导。 我敢打赌，每个在里约热内卢夺得金牌的人都会有一位教练。 他们中的大多数人可能会认为良好的指导是让他们达到目标的关键因素。

The more honest you can be with your manager about your aspirations, your motivations, and where you’d like their help to improve, the faster you’ll move.

你对你的经理越诚实，说明你的抱负、你的动机，以及你希望他们帮助改进的地方，你就会移动得越快。

## Create a mental image of yourself mastering the skills you most want to master, and believe that that is in your future.

## 想象自己掌握了最想掌握的技能，并相信那是你的未来。

A few years back, [I wrote about a little book that caught my eye at Safeway](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/the-secret-of-the-chicken-and-the-egg-206b7f1ce83b#.yix2h0shv), an obnoxious little thing with faux wax seal, quill-pen script, the ancient parchment paper glowing as if with magical beams. The book loudly proclaimed: _Get whatever you want. Discover the secret to life_.

几年前， [我写了一本在 Safeway 引起我注意的小书，这是](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/the-secret-of-the-chicken-and-the-egg-206b7f1ce83b#.yix2h0shv) 一本令人讨厌的小东西，上面有人造蜡封、鹅毛笔字、古老的羊皮纸，仿佛散发着神奇的光芒。 书中大声宣告： _要什么就拿什么。 发现生活的秘密_ 。

Spoiler warning ahead, but this is what the _secret to getting whatever you want_ turned out to be: if you believe it can happen, it will happen.

前方剧透警告，但这就是 _得到你想要的东西的秘诀_ ：如果你相信它会发生，它就会发生。

(I know, I know. I too was hoping it would be something more along the lines of _Burn a sprig of Douglas Fir at 11:23pm on the eve of the New Moon and bow three times to a fat armadillo_.)

（我知道，我知道。我也希望 _在新月前夕的晚上 11 点 23 分燃烧一根道格拉斯冷杉的小枝，并向一只肥胖的犰狳鞠躬三次_ 。）

As trivial as the new-age tidbit of _if you can believe it can happen, it will happen_ sounds, there is [research that shows if you can create a clear visualization of yourself achieving the outcome you want, you prime yourself to act in a way that is consistent with what you imagine](https://hbr.org/2014/03/to-reach-your-goals-make-a-mental-movie/).

就像新时代的花絮一样微不足道， _如果你能相信它会发生，它就会发生_ 听起来，有 [研究表明，如果你能清晰地想象自己实现你想要的结果，你就会让自己做好准备以某种方式行事那和你想象的是一致的](https://hbr.org/2014/03/to-reach-your-goals-make-a-mental-movie/) 。

Many years ago, when I was frustrated by all the things I struggled with and felt unequipped or scared to do in my job, I started a list of what I wished a future me would one day be able to waltz in and easily accomplish. This list is titled _One Day, I will…_

很多年前，当我对自己为之奋斗的所有事情感到沮丧，感到自己没有能力或害怕在工作中去做时，我开始列出我希望未来有一天能够轻松完成华尔兹的事情。 这份清单的标题是 _有一天，我会……_

Now, maybe seven or eight years later, this list is still up-to-date. I’ve added additional items throughout the years, but the more incredible thing is how I’ve been able to check things off. The skills that once seemed a distant dream when I was 25 or 26 now feel like second nature. And these proof points give me confidence that all the new items I am still adding will also happen. In 5 or so years, I’ll look back feeling great about having mastered those skills as well.

现在，也许七八年后，这份名单仍然是最新的。 这些年来我添加了额外的项目，但更令人难以置信的是我如何能够核对这些项目。 在我 25 或 26 岁时，这些技能曾经似乎是一个遥不可及的梦想，现在感觉像是第二天性。 这些证明点让我相信我仍在添加的所有新项目也会发生。 在 5 年左右的时间里，当我回首过去时，我会为自己也掌握了这些技能而感到高兴。

Going back to this list a few times a year gives me a deep sense of motivation and comfort. These things I can clearly visualize are totally doable. So do them I will.

每年几次回到这份清单给了我一种深深的动力和安慰。 这些我能清楚地想象出来的东西是完全可行的。 我也会的。

If you’re curious what my list looks like, here is a snippet of items checked off through the years, and items that I am still working on:

如果你好奇我的清单是什么样子的，这里有一些多年来核对过的项目，以及我仍在研究的项目：

_One Day, I will…_

_总有一天我会…_

…

…

✓ Not feel intimidated when I interview someone because I’m worried about what they think of me as an interviewer.

✓ 当我采访某人时不要感到害怕，因为我担心他们对我作为采访者的看法。

✓ Not be nervous about a public speaking event in the days before it happens.

## You own your career, and you have more of an ability to shape it than anybody else.

## 你拥有自己的事业，而且你比任何人都更有能力塑造它。

This is the last takeaway because no matter how many people are on the sidelines helping you, ignoring you, or working against you, your career — like your life — is _your_ responsibility. Don’t blame your manager, your significant other, your friends, or your company if you don’t have the career that you want. All of these things are in your power to affect or change.

这是最后要点，因为无论有多少人站在场边帮助你、忽视你或反对你，你的事业——就像你的生活一样——都是 _你的_ 责任。 如果你没有自己想要的职业，不要责怪你的经理、你的另一半、你的朋友或你的公司。 所有这些事情都在你的影响或改变的力量之内。

If you find it hard to wake up excited about going to work in the mornings, ask yourself why.

如果您发现早上起床后很难对去上班感到兴奋，问问自己为什么。

If you look back on your last six months and you can’t point to anything that’s been hard for you, question whether you are challenging yourself enough.

如果回顾过去六个月，你无法指出任何对你来说很艰难的事情，请质疑你是否足够挑战自己。

If you find yourself constantly looking for other people to tell you how awesome you’re doing, consider if you’re shortchanging your own growth and development.

如果您发现自己一直在寻找其他人来告诉您自己做得多么出色，请考虑一下您是否在牺牲自己的成长和发展。

If your manager is not giving you the support or coaching you’d like, tell her how you’d like to be supported or coached.

如果您的经理没有给您提供您想要的支持或指导，请告诉她您希望如何获得支持或指导。

If working at your current company is not aligned with your long-term goals or values, consider making a move.

如果在当前公司工作不符合您的长期目标或价值观，请考虑跳槽。

If you’ve never thought about where you’d like to be in three years, sit down and think about it.

如果你从来没有想过三年后你想去哪里，坐下来想一想。

No matter which way the wind blows, I hope you make it to beautiful shores.
