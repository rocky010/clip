Some people hear colors. Some taste sounds. A few, like me, can taste everything around us. The condition of synesthesia—experiencing one or multiple senses through another sense—offers a world informed by the intersection of our experiences rather than the boundaries between them, a world that exists between sense and sensation.

有些人听到颜色。 一些味道的声音。 像我这样的少数人可以品尝我们周围的一切。 联觉的条件——通过另一种感觉体验一种或多种感觉——提供了一个由我们经验的交集而不是它们之间的界限所告知的世界，一个存在于感觉和感觉之间的世界。

In my world, I experience flavors on my palate unique to each thing I see. Imagine you’re on Glenwood Avenue in East Atlanta Village. Here are a few of the flavors I experience: The road itself “tastes” kind of like blueberry Pop Rocks, while the light poles are almost like smooth, cool black licorice. Each building has its own flavor, some informed by the color of the facade—Argosy’s, with its dark-stained wood, is caramelly. Learning about synesthesia, and talking with synesthete friends, has revealed that my experience is part of a long history—and a reminder that we know less about our senses than we think we do.

在我的世界里，我的味觉对我所看到的每一件事都是独一无二的。 想象一下，您在东亚特兰大村的格伦伍德大道上。 以下是我体验到的一些味道：道路本身“尝起来”有点像蓝莓流行摇滚，而灯杆几乎像光滑、凉爽的黑色甘草。 每座建筑都有自己的风格，其中一些可以从立面的颜色中看出——Argosy 的木头是深色的，呈焦糖色。 了解联觉并与有联觉的朋友交谈，揭示了我的经历是一段悠久历史的一部分——并提醒我们，我们对自己的感官的了解比我们认为的要少。

The first known writing about synesthesia symptoms dates to the 1770s and the German poet and philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder, who described people experiencing the “obscure feeling” of sound in color, or chromesthesia. More consistent study picks up in the 1860s, when French physiologist Alfred Vulpian coined the word synesthesia, though he used it to refer to something else: coughing and sneezing triggered by touch and light. In 1873, Fidelis Alois Nussbaumer—apparently unfamiliar with Herder’s work—considered himself the first person in history to experience the condition, which he called phonopsie (phonopsia), for töne-sehen (seeing sounds). Later on, the word Vulpian created would be matched to the symptoms Nussbaumer described.

关于联觉症状的第一篇已知著作可追溯到 1770 年代，德国诗人兼哲学家约翰·戈特弗里德·赫尔德 (Johann Gottfried Herder) 描述了人们经历颜色声音或色觉的“模糊感觉”。 更一致的研究出现在 1860 年代，当时法国生理学家阿尔弗雷德·沃尔皮安 (Alfred Vulpian) 创造了联觉这个词，尽管他用它来指代其他事物：触摸和光线引发的咳嗽和打喷嚏。 1873 年，菲德利斯·阿洛伊斯·努斯鲍默（Fidelis Alois Nussbaumer）——显然不熟悉赫尔德的工作——认为自己是历史上第一个经历这种情况的人，他将其称为 phonopsie（phonopsia），意为 töne-sehen（看到声音）。 后来，Vulpian 创造的这个词将与 Nussbaumer 描述的症状相匹配。

In 1881, two Swiss medical students documented six different kinds of synesthesia, including the first I’ve found of gustatory synesthesia, which they describe as “color sensations for gustation perceptions.” Researchers then (and today) primarily focused on people who hear colors; until the turn of the 20th century, audition colorée was used to describe every form of synesthesia. The condition fell out of scholarly favor by midcentury but resurged in the 1970s, and, in the decades that followed, research has shown that synesthetes’ experiences are consistent across time and measurable in the brain.

1881 年，两名瑞士医学生记录了六种不同的联觉，包括我发现的第一种味觉联觉，他们将其描述为“味觉知觉的颜色感觉”。 当时（和今天）的研究人员主要关注能听到颜色的人； 直到 20 世纪之交，audiment colorée 才被用来描述各种形式的联觉。 到本世纪中叶，这种情况不再受到学术界的青睐，但在 1970 年代又重新流行起来，而且在随后的几十年里，研究表明，联觉者的经历在不同时间都是一致的，并且在大脑中是可以测量的。

Nowhere in the historical record have I found synesthesia to be stigmatized in the way many “disorders” have been. Instead of being looked on as a threat, synesthetes have, for the most part, been regarded as a curiosity, perhaps even as people whose lives have a bit more magic. Most describe their synesthesia as a gift: It’s like having a bonus sense, like a secret track on an album that only had a few copies made. For me as a food writer and all-around food enthusiast, that means an extra-rich soundtrack for my culinary adventures: I can cook flavors unique to my own experience and share them with others.

在历史记录中，我从未发现联觉会像许多“疾病”那样受到污名化。 在大多数情况下，联觉者并没有被视为威胁，而是被视为一种好奇心，甚至可能被视为生活更有魔力的人。 大多数人将他们的联觉描述为一种天赋：这就像拥有一种额外的感觉，就像一张只制作了几张的专辑中的秘密曲目。 作为一名美食作家和全能美食爱好者，对于我来说，这意味着我的烹饪冒险有一个额外丰富的配乐：我可以根据自己的经验烹制独特的风味，并与他人分享。

Each person’s experience of a place or object may be different, because synesthetic “tastes” seem to be deeply rooted within each of our personal experiences. These differences can be amplified by the layers of flavor in a given environment: While individual objects have their own flavor, these come together into an overall experience, just as individual ingredients come together in a meal. The secret track becomes your secret track: a special part of the world that no one else tastes or feels in exactly the same way. It’s beautiful, confusing, exhausting, and wonderful all at once. As a historian, it makes me wonder how many other cooks have been equally informed by the flavors around them that only they can perceive. Did they share my equal parts frustration and joy with this disconnect? Are there whispers of their culinary exploits, the flavors of their extra sense(s), still to be found in food we eat today?

每个人对一个地方或物体的体验可能不同，因为联觉“品味”似乎深深植根于我们每个人的个人体验中。 这些差异可以通过给定环境中的味道层次来放大：虽然单个物体有自己的味道，但它们汇集在一起形成整体体验，就像单独的成分在一顿饭中汇集在一起一样。 秘密轨道成为您的秘密轨道：世界上一个特殊的部分，没有其他人以完全相同的方式品尝或感受。 它既美丽，令人困惑，令人筋疲力尽，又美妙。 作为一名历史学家，这让我想知道有多少其他厨师同样了解他们周围只有他们才能感知的风味。 他们是否因这种脱节而分享我的沮丧和快乐？ 在我们今天吃的食物中，是否仍有关于他们的烹饪技巧、他们超凡感官的味道的传闻？

I love to try to turn the world around me into edible experiments based on texture, color, shape—and, of course, taste. Sometimes, this offers a pleasant sensory surprise (like a vanilla-rhubarb sauerkraut I made), but sometimes, a flavor as it exists in my mind is a far cry from the actual flavor combination itself (see, for example: chocolate cake with raw tomatoes).

我喜欢尝试根据质地、颜色、形状，当然还有味道，将我周围的世界变成可食用的实验品。 有时，这会带来令人愉悦的感官惊喜（就像我制作的香草大黄酸菜），但有时，我脑海中存在的一种味道与实际的味道组合本身相去甚远（例如，参见：生巧克力蛋糕番茄）。

Perhaps the easiest way to start is just to take a moment before eating to imagine what each food might taste like based on its color, texture, and so on. Then, focus on a nonfood object in your environment. Define its characteristics: What is its color? Shape? Size? What other foods can you think of that share those characteristics? Let’s say the object is a wooden cutting board. Maybe it’s the color of butterscotch or caramel, and might even be a similar shape, like the soft rectangles of a chewy candy. Is the surface hard and smooth, like a table, or soft and warm, like a fleece jacket? Is it warm or cool to the touch? The texture of the wood can help us imagine if we might associate it with a hard caramel candy or a soft and chewy one—or something warm, like caramel sauce. I’ve noticed that regular meditation and mindfulness practice helps, too, perhaps because I’m more tuned in to my surroundings and my connection to them.

任何人都可以稍微尝尝这个世界的味道。也许最简单的开始方法是在吃之前花点时间，根据每种食物的颜色、质地等来想象它的味道。然后，专注于您环境中的非食品对象。定义它的特点：它的颜色是什么？形状？尺寸？你能想到哪些其他具有这些特征的食物？假设这个物体是一块木制切割板。也许它是奶油威士忌或焦糖的颜色，甚至可能是类似的形状，比如耐嚼糖果的柔软矩形。表面是坚硬光滑，像桌子，还是柔软温暖，像羊毛夹克？摸起来是暖和还是凉？木材的质地可以帮助我们想象我们是否可以将其与硬焦糖糖果或柔软耐嚼的糖果或温暖的东西（如焦糖酱）联系起来。我注意到定期冥想和正念练习也有帮助，也许是因为我更关注周围的环境以及我与它们的联系。

I’ve tried this out with a few nonsynesthete friends, and they’ve come up with some surprising and nuanced results. One friend noted they had seen, but never really observed, their table before. The scratches and dents, the smooth finish, the warmth of the wood, all ultimately helped her formulate a bread pudding, the crunch of the top of the dessert contrasting with the warmth and softness underneath. Did she experience synesthesia through making this bread pudding? No. But did sitting down at her table, and drawing a connection between place and taste, help her appreciate the world around her in new ways? Almost certainly.

我和几个非联觉的朋友试过这个，他们得出了一些令人惊讶和微妙的结果。 一位朋友说他们以前见过但从未真正观察过他们的桌子。 划痕和凹痕、光滑的表面、木头的温暖，所有这些最终都帮助她制作了面包布丁，甜点顶部的嘎吱声与下面的温暖和柔软形成鲜明对比。 她是不是因为做这个面包布丁而产生了通感？ 不，但是坐在她的餐桌旁，在地点和品味之间建立联系，是否帮助她以新的方式欣赏周围的世界？ 几乎肯定。
