Picture this: it’s a work day at an enterprise payments processing company, and there is a critical data engineering task that needs to be completed. In this case, I’m the data engineer who needs to finish the task, but I am missing information necessary for my data model to be finished. I heard the information in a meeting. It was discussed in the daily standup. I have some vague typed notes, but I can’t recall the technical details I need to finish my work. No one is available to answer my question. It’s then that it hits me: I should have written down notes by hand during the meeting. 

想象一下：这是一家企业支付处理公司的工作日，需要完成一项关键的数据工程任务。 在这种情况下，我是需要完成任务的数据工程师，但我缺少完成数据模型所需的信息。 我在一次会议上听到了这个信息。 它在每日站会中进行了讨论。 我有一些模糊的打字笔记，但我不记得完成工作所需的技术细节。 没有人可以回答我的问题。 就在那时我突然想到：我应该在会议期间手写笔记。

Writing notes by hand would have given me several different tangible resources that could help me find the critical missing information: a stronger memory of the meeting I was in, the gaps in the details of the discussion that occurred, and the notes themselves that would help me trigger a stronger recall of the events just by reviewing them on paper. Detailed typed notes would not help my recall and retention of the information in the meetings in the same way that notes written by hand would, though they would have been helpful.

手写笔记会给我几种不同的有形资源，可以帮助我找到关键的缺失信息：对我参加的会议的更深刻的记忆，发生的讨论细节中的差距，以及有助于我的笔记本身我只是通过在纸上回顾事件来触发对事件的更强烈的回忆。 详细的打字笔记不会像手写笔记那样帮助我回忆和保留会议中的信息，尽管它们会有所帮助。

It’s hard to keep documentation accurate for a whole organization or even a team with day-to-day process, programming, business, and client changes at the micro and macro levels. But as individuals who consume new information on a minute-by-minute basis, we can learn what we need to with more information retention, cognitive recall, stronger reading comprehension, and a tactile, visual memory of the information we consumed just by hand writing our notes. Writing by hand still remains the most powerful way to learn and retain information. 

很难在微观和宏观层面为整个组织甚至团队保持文档的准确性，包括日常流程、编程、业务和客户变更。 但作为每分钟都在消耗新信息的个人，我们可以通过更多的信息保留、认知回忆、更强的阅读理解以及对我们仅通过手写消耗的信息的触觉、视觉记忆来学习我们需要的东西我们的笔记。 手写仍然是学习和保留信息最有效的方式。

## Writing by hand creates stronger reading comprehension

## 手写可以提高阅读理解力

It would come as no surprise to most people that human beings are visual learners. This applies even to writing, though at first written words and visual learning may seem different. When a person thinks of “visual learning”, what may be pictured are videos, images, and other forms of graphic information and media. Yet letters and words are visual representations of a mutually-agreed upon social communication form: written language. 

对于大多数人来说，人类是视觉学习者并不奇怪。 这甚至适用于写作，尽管起初书面文字和视觉学习可能看起来不同。 当一个人想到“视觉学习”时，可能想象的是视频、图像和其他形式的图形信息和媒体。 然而，字母和单词是共同商定的社会交流形式的视觉表现：书面语言。

When a young human is learning to read, they must first learn to recognize the different shapes called “letters” that belong to their native alphabet. A letter means nothing to a person who does not know what sound or function that letter is supposed to represent in language. So as human beings, before we learn what a word is, we first must learn that the graphical representation of a letter means something. We must also learn the differences between individual letters as well as variations in the shapes, sizes, and styles of those letters. 

当一个年轻人学习阅读时，他们必须首先学会识别属于他们母语字母表的称为“字母”的不同形状。 对于不知道该字母在语言中应该代表什么声音或功能的人来说，一个字母毫无意义。 所以作为人类，在我们了解一个词是什么之前，我们首先必须了解一个字母的图形表示是什么意思。 我们还必须了解各个字母之间的差异以及这些字母的形状、大小和样式的变化。

In [a 2012 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211949312000038) published in _Trends in Neuroscience and Education_, researchers Karin James and Laura Engelhardt observed of pre-literate children, “When children begin to print, their motor output (of a letter) does not conform to prototypical lettering: each output (which is also the perceptual input) can be said to be noisy relative to the model.” Despite the fact that the children’s recreation of a letter was messy compared to the letter model, their  brains still accurately recognized that the letter they drew was the same one they attempted to copy. As James and Engelhardt said, the children recognized these letters “presumably because the children themselves created them.” This is visual learning and acumen: the children needed to learn what an individual letter looked like in its various “noisy” and exemplary forms in order to identify and comprehend that letter in the future, regardless of its representation. 

在 [2012 年](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211949312000038) 发表于 _Trends in Neuroscience and Education_ 的一项研究中，研究人员 Karin James 和 Laura Engelhardt 观察了未识字儿童，“当儿童开始打印时，他们的（字母的）运动输出不符合原型字母：每个输出（这也是感知输入）可以说相对于模型来说是嘈杂的。” 尽管与字母模型相比，孩子们对字母的再创造是混乱的，但他们的大脑仍然准确地识别出他们画的字母与他们试图复制的字母相同。 正如詹姆斯和恩格尔哈特所说，孩子们认出了这些字母“大概是因为孩子们自己创造了它们”。 这是视觉学习和敏锐度：孩子们需要了解单个字母在各种“嘈杂”和示范形式下的样子，以便在未来识别和理解该字母，无论其表示形式如何。

Handwriting is a unique expression of each person who learns to write; they represent letters and words as a written output of what they perceive those letters to be. James and Engelhardt showed in their study that this repetitive, creative handwriting also creates stronger reading comprehension and maturity of language recognition. “The most novel result of our ROI analysis,” say James and Engelhardt, “is that visual processing of letters is affected by specific motor experience—the act of printing a letter”. 

手写是每个学习写字的人的独特表现； 他们将字母和单词表示为他们认为这些字母是什么的书面输出。 James 和 Engelhardt 在他们的研究中表明，这种重复的、有创意的手写也能提高阅读理解力和语言识别的成熟度。 “我们 ROI 分析的最新颖的结果，”James 和 Engelhardt 说，“是字母的视觉处理受到特定运动体验的影响——打印字母的行为”。

## Writing by hand creates a tactile information recall

## 手写会产生触觉信息回忆

One of the most important parts of learning new information is the ability to retain it and recall it later when it is relevant. Writing by hand on paper creates a tactile, personalized experience each time a person takes notes. The complex experience of hand writing on paper contains a multitude of variable elements: the creativity of an individual’s written representation of language, the texture of the paper itself, the fine motor skills needed to translate thoughts into written language, the engagement of the physical senses, and even the reading comprehension strength that we learned of earlierAll of these complexities create a stronger memory of the information that is taken in during the note taking. 

学习新信息最重要的部分之一是能够记住它并在相关时回忆起它。 每次人们做笔记时，在纸上手写都会产生触觉、个性化的体验。 在纸上手写的复杂体验包含多种可变因素：个人书面表达语言的创造力、纸张本身的质地、将思想转化为书面语言所需的精细运动技能、身体感官的参与，甚至是我们之前学到的阅读理解强度，所有这些复杂性都会让我们在做笔记时对所吸收的信息产生更强的记忆力。

There have been a few scientific studies done on the subject of information processing through digital note taking and notes taken by hand. [A recent study led by neuroscientist Professor Kuniyoshi Sakai](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210319080820.htm) at the University of Tokyo published in March 2021 showed that subjects who recorded calendar event information on paper showed more brain activity than subjects who recorded the same information onto a smartphone when they attempted to recall details about that calendar information later. And they recalled/entered the information 25% faster when writing it by hand. 

已经有一些关于通过数字笔记和手写笔记进行信息处理的科学研究。 [2021 年 3 月发表的一项由东京大学神经科学家酒井邦义教授领导的最新研究](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210319080820.htm) 表明，在纸上记录日历事件信息的受试者在试图回忆相关细节时比在智能手机上记录相同信息的受试者表现出更多的大脑活动日历信息稍后。 当他们手写时，他们回忆/输入信息的速度提高了 25%。

Professor Sakai suggests that analog and paper learning experiences cannot be mimicked by the uniform ways in which digital devices represent information. “Digital tools have uniform scrolling up and down and standardized arrangement of text and picture size, like on a webpage. But if you remember a physical textbook printed on paper, you can close your eyes and visualize the photo one-third of the way down on the left-side page, as well as the notes you added in the bottom margin,” says the neuroscientist. That stronger tactile memory is easier for the brain to recall later on even when the paper isn’t present later; so is the information the brain associates with that learning experience.   

酒井教授建议，数字设备表示信息的统一方式无法模仿模拟和纸上学习体验。 “数字工具有统一的上下滚动和标准化的文本和图片大小排列，就像在网页上一样。 但是，如果你记得一本印在纸上的物理教科书，你可以闭上眼睛，想象一下左侧页面向下三分之一处的照片，以及你在底部空白处添加的注释，”这位神经科学家说. 更强的触觉记忆更容易让大脑在以后回忆起来，即使后来没有纸。 大脑与学习经历相关联的信息也是如此。

## Typing doesn’t have the same cognitive effects

## 打字没有相同的认知效果

We know that typing does not engage the brain with the same level of cognitive interaction as handwriting for various reasons. This has been a hot topic in the early education sphere around the world for over a decade as typed notes and digital notepads become more and more popular in classrooms. In fact, replacing handwriting with typing notes [could be detrimental to early literacy skills](https://pld-literacy.org/the-importance-of-teaching-handwriting-for-cognitive-development/) because it lacks the creativity necessary for strong reading comprehension and faster note-taking. 

我们知道，由于各种原因，打字不会让大脑参与与手写相同水平的认知互动。 十多年来，随着打字笔记和数字记事本在课堂上越来越流行，这一直是全球早期教育领域的热门话题。 事实上，用打字笔记代替手写 [可能不利于早期识字技能](https://pld-literacy.org/the-importance-of-teaching-handwriting-for-cognitive-development/) ，因为它缺乏强大的阅读理解能力和更快的记笔记能力所必需的创造力。

In a study from the Developmental Neuroscience Laboratory at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology , [Professor Audrey van der Meer confirms](https://bigthink.com/the-present/handwriting-memory/) that a keystroke on a keyboard lacks the creativity of handwriting and won’t challenge memory the way that writing by hand does. Two professors from University of Umeå, Sweden  [champion writing by hand for students](https://www.cambridge.org/elt/blog/2019/12/19/writing-cognitive-process/) as a cognitive process necessary for the best learning experience: “Think of writing as learning an instrument: separate skills…need to be practiced in order for the player to become independent of the mechanics and allow for full expression of…the meaning.” 

在挪威科技大学发展神经科学实验室的一项研究中， [Audrey van der Meer 教授证实](https://bigthink.com/the-present/handwriting-memory/) ，键盘上的击键缺乏手写的创造力，不会像手写那样挑战记忆力。 瑞典于默奥大学的两位教授 [支持学生手写写作，](https://www.cambridge.org/elt/blog/2019/12/19/writing-cognitive-process/) 认为这是获得最佳学习体验所必需的认知过程：“将写作视为学习一种工具：不同的技能……需要练习才能让玩家独立于机制并允许充分表达……意义。”

Although typing notes can be useful and even faster for some note-takers, ultimately it does not have the cognitive, tactile, memory, or visual cognitive effects that people can get when they write by hand. Typing notes can be good, but it won’t make it easier to remember what was said later on. 

虽然打字笔记对一些记笔记的人来说很有用，甚至更快，但最终它不具备人们手写时所能获得的认知、触觉、记忆或视觉认知效果。 打字笔记可能很好，但它不会让你更容易记住后面所说的内容。

## Proceed with caution

## 谨慎行事

Perhaps you’re like me and you already take notes by hand sometimes. I hope you’ve been writing down the parts of this blog that you want to remember if that’s the case! If not and you also like to type sometimes like me, be nice to your hands as you begin your handwritten note journey again. Be prepared to feel challenged physically and mentally as you develop a new practice. Spend some money on a notebook you like, with paper that feels good against the rough scratch or smooth roll of your favorite pen. Those tactile moments will live in your mind when you want the information again later. 

也许你和我一样，有时已经用手记笔记了。 如果是这样的话，我希望你已经记下了这篇博客中你想记住的部分！ 如果不是，并且您有时也像我一样喜欢打字，请在您再次开始手写笔记之旅时善待您的双手。 准备好在进行新练习时感到身体和精神上的挑战。 花点钱买一个你喜欢的笔记本，用感觉很好的纸来防止你最喜欢的钢笔的粗糙划痕或光滑的滚动。 当您稍后再次需要这些信息时，那些触觉时刻将留在您的脑海中。

Writing by hand remains the best way to take in new information. It helps with reading comprehension, creativity, memory, and information retention in ways that are unmatched by other learning tools. Your writing, your shorthand, and your notes that look incomprehensible to others are a special part of your processing that help you learn in your way. So go ahead and get writing. By hand, of course. 

手写仍然是获取新信息的最佳方式。 它以其他学习工具无法比拟的方式帮助阅读理解、创造力、记忆力和信息保留。 你的写作、速记和别人看起来难以理解的笔记是你处理过程中的一个特殊部分，可以帮助你以自己的方式学习。 所以继续写吧。 当然是用手。
