The brains of adolescents who were assessed after the pandemic shutdowns ended appeared several years older than those of teens who were assessed before the pandemic. Until now, such accelerated changes in “brain age” have only been seen in children experiencing chronic adversity, such as neglect and family dysfunction.

在流感大流行结束后接受评估的青少年的大脑比流感大流行之前接受评估的青少年的大脑要老几岁。到目前为止，这种“大脑年龄”的加速变化只出现在经历慢性逆境的儿童身上，如被忽视和家庭功能障碍。

A new study from Stanford University suggests that pandemic-related stressors have physically altered adolescents’ brains, making their brain structures appear several years older than the brains of comparable peers before the pandemic. The study was [published](https://www.bpsgos.org/article/S2667-1743(22)00142-2/fulltext) on Dec. 1, 2022, in _Biological Psychiatry: Global Open Science_.

斯坦福大学的一项新研究表明，与大流行相关的压力源已经从物理上改变了青少年的大脑，使他们的大脑结构看起来比大流行之前的同龄人的大脑老好几岁。 该研究于 [2022 年 12 月 1 日发表](https://www.bpsgos.org/article/S2667-1743(22)00142-2/fulltext) 在《 _生物精神病学：全球开放科学》_ 上。

In 2020 alone, reports of anxiety and depression in adults rose by more than 25 percent compared to previous years. The new findings indicate that the neurological and mental health effects of the pandemic on adolescents may have been [even worse](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0331-youth-mental-health-covid-19.html).

仅在 2020 年，成年人焦虑和抑郁的报告就比往年增加了 25% 以上。 新发现表明，大流行对青少年的神经和心理健康影响可能 [更为严重](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0331-youth-mental-health-covid-19.html) 。

“We already know from global research that the pandemic has adversely affected mental health in youth, but we didn’t know what, if anything, it was doing physically to their brains,” said [Ian Gotlib](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ian-gotlib), the Marjorie Mhoon Fair Professor of Psychology in the [School of Humanities & Sciences](https://humsci.stanford.edu/), who is the first author on the paper.

“我们已经从全球研究中得知，这种流行病对年轻人的心理健康产生了不利影响，但我们不知道它对他们的大脑造成了什么影响，如果有的话，”伊恩戈特利布说 [，](https://profiles.stanford.edu/ian-gotlib) 他是 Marjorie Mhoon Fair 的心理学教授。人文 [科学学院](https://humsci.stanford.edu/) ，论文第一作者。

Changes in brain structure occur naturally as we age, Gotlib notes. During puberty and early teenage years, kids’ bodies experience increased growth in both the hippocampus and the amygdala, areas of the brain that respectively control access to certain memories and help to modulate emotions. At the same time, tissues in the cortex, an area involved in executive functioning, become thinner.

Gotlib 指出，随着年龄的增长，大脑结构会自然发生变化。 在青春期和青少年早期，孩子的身体在海马体和杏仁核中都经历了增长，这两个大脑区域分别控制对某些记忆的访问并帮助调节情绪。 与此同时，皮层中的组织（一个涉及执行功能的区域）变得更薄。

By comparing MRI scans from a cohort of 163 children taken before and during the pandemic, Gotlib’s study showed that this developmental process sped up in adolescents as they experienced the COVID-19 lockdowns. Until now, he says, these sorts of accelerated changes in “brain age” have appeared only in children who have experienced chronic adversity, whether from violence, neglect, family dysfunction, or a combination of multiple factors.

通过比较 163 名儿童在大流行之前和期间进行的 MRI 扫描，Gotlib 的研究表明，青少年在经历 COVID-19 封锁后，这一发育过程加快了。 他说，直到现在，这种“脑龄”的加速变化只出现在经历过长期逆境的儿童身上，无论是来自暴力、忽视、家庭功能障碍，还是多种因素的结合。

Although those experiences are linked to poor mental health outcomes later in life, it’s unclear whether the changes in brain structure that the Stanford team observed are linked to changes in mental health, Gotlib noted.

Gotlib 指出，尽管这些经历与晚年心理健康状况不佳有关，但尚不清楚斯坦福团队观察到的大脑结构变化是否与心理健康变化有关。

“It’s also not clear if the changes are permanent,” said Gotlib, who is also the director of the Stanford Neurodevelopment, Affect, and Psychopathology (SNAP) Laboratory at Stanford University. “Will their chronological age eventually catch up to their ‘brain age’? If their brain remains permanently older than their chronological age, it’s unclear what the outcomes will be in the future. For a 70- or 80-year-old, you’d expect some cognitive and memory problems based on changes in the brain, but what does it mean for a 16-year-old if their brains are aging prematurely?”

“还不清楚这些变化是否是永久性的，”同时担任斯坦福大学斯坦福神经发育、情感和精神病理学 (SNAP) 实验室主任的 Gotlib 说。 “他们的实足年龄最终会赶上他们的‘大脑年龄’吗？ 如果他们的大脑永远比他们的实足年龄老，那么未来的结果会怎样就不得而知了。 对于一个 70 岁或 80 岁的人来说，你会因为大脑的变化而出现一些认知和记忆问题，但如果他们的大脑过早老化，这对一个 16 岁的人来说意味着什么？”

Originally, Gotlib explained, his study was not designed to look at the impact of COVID-19 on brain structure. Before the pandemic, his lab had recruited a cohort of children and adolescents from around the San Francisco Bay Area to participate in a long-term study on depression during puberty – but when the pandemic hit, he could not conduct regularly-scheduled MRI scans on those youth.

Gotlib 解释说，最初他的研究并不是为了研究 COVID-19 对大脑结构的影响。 在大流行之前，他的实验室从旧金山湾区周围招募了一批儿童和青少年，参与一项关于青春期抑郁症的长期研究——但当大流行来袭时，他无法对孩子进行定期的核磁共振扫描。那些青春。

“Then, nine months later, we had a hard restart,” Gotlib said.

“然后，九个月后，我们进行了艰难的重启，”Gotlib 说。

Once Gotlib could continue brain scans from his cohort, the study was a year behind schedule. Under normal circumstances, it would be possible to statistically correct for the delay while analyzing the study’s data – but the pandemic was far from a normal event. “That technique only works if you assume the brains of 16-year-olds today are the same as the brains of 16-year-olds before the pandemic with respect to cortical thickness and hippocampal and amygdala volume,” Gotlib said. “After looking at our data, we realized that they’re not. Compared to adolescents assessed before the pandemic, adolescents assessed after the pandemic shutdowns not only had more severe internalizing mental health problems, but also had reduced cortical thickness, larger hippocampal and amygdala volume, and more advanced brain age.”

一旦 Gotlib 可以继续对他的队列进行脑部扫描，这项研究就比计划晚了一年。 在正常情况下，可以在分析研究数据的同时对延迟进行统计校正——但大流行远非正常事件。 “只有当你假设今天 16 岁的大脑在皮质厚度、海马体和杏仁核体积方面与大流行前的 16 岁大脑相同时，这项技术才有效，”Gotlib 说。 “在查看了我们的数据之后，我们意识到它们并非如此。 与大流行前评估的青少年相比，大流行关闭后评估的青少年不仅有更严重的内化心理健康问题，而且皮质厚度减少，海马和杏仁核体积更大，大脑年龄更高。”

These findings could have major implications for other longitudinal studies that have spanned the pandemic. If kids who experienced the pandemic show accelerated development in their brains, scientists will have to account for that abnormal rate of growth in any future research involving this generation.

这些发现可能对跨越大流行的其他纵向研究产生重大影响。 如果经历过大流行的孩子大脑发育加快，科学家们将不得不在未来涉及这一代人的任何研究中考虑到这种异常的增长速度。

“The pandemic is a global phenomenon – there’s no one who hasn’t experienced it,” said Gotlib. “There’s no real control group.”

“大流行是一种全球现象——没有人没有经历过，”戈特利布说。 “没有真正的对照组。”

These findings might also have serious consequences for an entire generation of adolescents later in life, added co-author Jonas Miller, who was a postdoctoral fellow in Gotlib’s lab during the study and is now an assistant professor of psychological sciences at the University of Connecticut.

这些发现也可能对整整一代青少年的晚年产生严重后果，共同作者乔纳斯米勒补充说，他在研究期间是戈特利实验室的博士后研究员，现在是康涅狄格大学心理科学助理教授。

“Adolescence is already a period of rapid reorganization in the brain, and it’s already linked to increased rates of mental health problems, depression, and risk-taking behavior,” Miller said. “Now you have this global event that’s happening, where everyone is experiencing some kind of adversity in the form of disruption to their daily routines – so it might be the case that the brains of kids who are 16 or 17 today are not comparable to those of their counterparts just a few years ago.”

“青春期已经是大脑快速重组的时期，它已经与精神健康问题、抑郁和冒险行为的发生率增加有关，”米勒说。 “现在你有这个正在发生的全球事件，每个人都在经历某种形式的逆境，形式是他们的日常生活被打乱——所以今天 16 岁或 17 岁的孩子的大脑可能无法与那些人相比他们的同行就在几年前。”

In the future, Gotlib plans to continue following the same cohort of kids through later adolescence and young adulthood, tracking whether the COVID pandemic has changed the trajectory of their brain development over the long term. He also plans to track the mental health of these teens and will compare the brain structure of those who were infected with the virus with those who weren’t, with the goal of identifying any subtle differences that may have occurred.

未来，Gotlib 计划在青春期后期和成年早期继续跟踪同一群孩子，追踪 COVID 大流行是否长期改变了他们大脑发育的轨迹。 他还计划跟踪这些青少年的心理健康状况，并将感染病毒的人和未感染病毒的人的大脑结构进行比较，目的是找出可能发生的任何细微差异。
