My work at OpenAI reminds me every day about the magnitude of the socioeconomic change that is coming sooner than most people believe. Software that can think and learn will do more and more of the work that people now do. Even more power will shift from labor to capital. If public policy doesn’t adapt accordingly, most people will end up worse off than they are today.

我在OpenAI的工作每天都在提醒我，即将到来的社会经济变革的规模比大多数人认为的要快。可以思考和学习的软件将完成越来越多的人们现在所做的工作。更多的权力将从劳动力转移到资本。如果公共政策不做出相应调整，大多数人最终的境况将比现在更糟。

We need to design a system that embraces this technological future and taxes the assets that will make up most of the value in that world–companies and land–in order to fairly distribute some of the coming wealth. Doing so can make the society of the future much less divisive and enable everyone to participate in its gains.

我们需要设计一个拥抱这一技术未来的体系，并对将构成这个世界大部分价值的资产--公司和土地--征税，以便公平地分配即将到来的一些财富。这样做可以使未来社会的分裂程度大大减少，并使每个人都能分享其收益。

In the next five years, computer programs that can think will read legal documents and give medical advice. In the next decade, they will do assembly-line work and maybe even become companions. And in the decades after that, they will do almost everything, including making new scientific discoveries that will expand our concept of “everything.”

在接下来的五年里，能够思考的计算机程序将阅读法律文件并提供医疗建议。在接下来的十年里，他们将从事流水线工作，甚至可能成为伴侣。在那之后的几十年里，他们将做几乎所有的事情，包括做出新的科学发现，扩大我们对“一切”的概念。

This technological revolution is unstoppable. And a recursive loop of innovation, as these smart machines themselves help us make smarter machines, will accelerate the revolution’s pace. Three crucial consequences follow:

这场技术革命势不可挡。随着这些智能机器本身帮助我们制造更智能的机器，一个递归的创新循环将加快革命的步伐。以下是三个关键的后果：

1.  This revolution will create phenomenal wealth. The price of many kinds of labor (which drives the costs of goods and services) will fall toward zero once sufficiently powerful AI “joins the workforce.”
    
    这场革命将创造惊人的财富。一旦足够强大的人工智能加入劳动力大军，许多种类的劳动力(推动商品和服务成本)的价格将降至零。
    
2.  The world will change so rapidly and drastically that an equally drastic change in policy will be needed to distribute this wealth and enable more people to pursue the life they want.
    
    世界将发生如此迅速和剧烈的变化，需要在政策上做出同样剧烈的改变，以分配这些财富，使更多的人能够追求他们想要的生活。
    
3.  If we get both of these right, we can improve the standard of living for people more than we ever have before.
    
    如果我们都做对了这两件事，我们就可以比以往任何时候都更好地提高人民的生活水平。
    

Because we are at the beginning of this tectonic shift, we have a rare opportunity to pivot toward the future. That pivot can’t simply address current social and political problems; it must be designed for the radically different society of the near future. Policy plans that don’t account for this imminent transformation will fail for the same reason that the organizing principles of pre-agrarian or feudal societies would fail today.

因为我们正处于这一结构性转变的开始，我们有一个难得的机会来转向未来。这种转向不能简单地解决当前的社会和政治问题；它必须为不久的将来截然不同的社会而设计。没有考虑到这种迫在眉睫的转变的政策计划将失败，原因与前农业社会或封建社会的组织原则今天将失败一样。

What follows is a description of what’s coming and a plan for how to navigate this new landscape.

以下是对即将发生的事情的描述，以及如何驾驭这一新格局的计划。

## Part 1 The AI Revolution  
## 第一部分 人工智能革命  

On a zoomed-out time scale, technological progress follows an exponential curve. Compare how the world looked 15 years ago (no smartphones, really), 150 years ago (no combustion engine, no home electricity), 1,500 years ago (no industrial machines), and 15,000 years ago (no agriculture).

在缩小的时间尺度上，技术进步遵循指数曲线。比较一下15年前(真的没有智能手机)、150年前(没有内燃机，没有家庭用电)、1500年前(没有工业机器)和15,000年前(没有农业)的世界。

The coming change will center around the most impressive of our capabilities: the phenomenal ability to think, create, understand, and reason. To the three great technological revolutions–the agricultural, the industrial, and the computational–we will add a fourth: the AI revolution. This revolution will generate enough wealth for everyone to have what they need, if we as a society manage it responsibly.

即将到来的变化将围绕着我们最令人印象深刻的能力：思考、创造、理解和推理的非凡能力。在三大技术革命-农业、工业和计算机--的基础上，我们将增加第四场：人工智能革命。如果我们作为一个社会负责任地管理，这场革命将产生足够的财富，让每个人都能拥有他们需要的东西。

The technological progress we make in the next 100 years will be far larger than all we’ve made since we first controlled fire and invented the wheel. We have already built AI systems that can learn and do useful things. They are still primitive, but the trendlines are clear.

在接下来的100年里，我们取得的技术进步将远远超过自我们第一次控制火和发明轮子以来取得的所有进步。我们已经建立了可以学习和做有用事情的人工智能系统。它们仍然是原始的，但趋势线是明确的。

## Part 2  Moore's Law for Everything  

## 第二部分 摩尔定律适用于一切事物  

Broadly speaking, there are two paths to affording a good life: an individual acquires more money (which makes that person wealthier), or prices fall (which makes everyone wealthier). Wealth is buying power: how much we can get with the resources we have.

从广义上讲，有两种途径可以让人们过上好日子：一个人获得更多的钱(这会让他变得更富有)，或者价格下跌(这会让所有人都变得更富有)。财富就是购买力：我们能用我们拥有的资源得到多少。

The best way to increase societal wealth is to decrease the cost of goods, from food to video games. Technology will rapidly drive that decline in many categories. Consider the example of semiconductors and Moore’s Law: for decades, chips became twice as powerful for the same price about every two years.

增加社会财富的最好方法是降低从食品到电子游戏的商品成本。技术将在许多类别中迅速推动这一下降。以半导体和摩尔定律为例：在几十年的时间里，大约每两年，同样的价格，芯片的性能就会翻一番。

In the last couple of decades, costs in the US for TVs, computers, and entertainment have dropped. But other costs have risen significantly, most notably those for housing, healthcare, and higher education. Redistribution of wealth alone won’t work if these costs continue to soar.

在过去的几十年里，美国电视、电脑和娱乐的成本有所下降。但其他成本也大幅上升，最明显的是住房、医疗保健和高等教育成本。如果这些成本继续飙升，单靠财富再分配是行不通的。

AI will lower the cost of goods and services, because labor is the driving cost at many levels of the supply chain. If robots can build a house on land you already own from natural resources mined and refined onsite, using solar power, the cost of building that house is close to the cost to rent the robots. And if those robots are made by other robots, the cost to rent them will be much less than it was when humans made them.

人工智能将降低商品和服务的成本，因为劳动力是供应链许多层面的驱动成本。如果机器人可以利用太阳能在你已经拥有的土地上建造一座房子，利用现场开采和提炼的自然资源，那么建造这座房子的成本就接近租用机器人的成本。如果这些机器人是由其他机器人制造的，那么租用它们的成本将比人类制造它们时要低得多。

Similarly, we can imagine AI doctors that can diagnose health problems better than any human, and AI teachers that can diagnose and explain exactly what a student doesn’t understand.

同样，我们可以想象，人工智能医生比任何人都能更好地诊断健康问题，人工智能教师可以准确诊断和解释学生不理解的东西。

“Moore’s Law for everything” should be the rallying cry of a generation whose members can’t afford what they want. It sounds utopian, but it’s something technology can deliver (and in some cases already has). Imagine a world where, for decades, everything–housing, education, food, clothing, etc.–became half as expensive every two years.

“摩尔定律适用于一切”应该是这一代人的战斗口号，他们的成员买不起他们想要的东西。这听起来像乌托邦，但这是技术可以提供的东西(在某些情况下已经做到了)。想象一下，在几十年的时间里，住房、教育、食品、服装等一切东西的价格每两年就会下降一半。

We will discover new jobs–we always do after a technological revolution–and because of the abundance on the other side, we will have incredible freedom to be creative about what they are.

我们将发现新的工作--我们总是在技术革命之后这样做--由于另一边的丰富，我们将拥有令人难以置信的自由，可以对它们进行创造性的创造。

## Part 3 Capitalism for Everyone  
## 第三部分 人人都有资本主义  

A stable economic system requires two components: growth and inclusivity. Economic growth matters because most people want their lives to improve every year. In a zero-sum world, one with no or very little growth, democracy can become antagonistic as people seek to vote money away from each other. What follows from that antagonism is distrust and polarization. In a high-growth world the dogfights can be far fewer, because it’s much easier for everyone to win.

一个稳定的经济体系需要两个组成部分：增长和包容性。经济增长之所以重要，是因为大多数人希望自己的生活一年比一年好。在一个零和世界，一个没有或几乎没有增长的世界里，民主可能会变得敌对，因为人们试图投票把钱从对方手中夺走。随之而来的是不信任和两极分化。在一个高增长的世界里，斗狗可能会少得多，因为这对每个人来说都更容易获胜。

Economic inclusivity means everyone having a reasonable opportunity to get the resources they need to live the life they want. Economic inclusivity matters because it’s fair, produces a stable society, and can create the largest slices of pie for the most people. As a side benefit, it produces more growth.

经济包容性意味着每个人都有合理的机会获得他们所需的资源，以过上他们想要的生活。经济包容性之所以重要，是因为它是公平的，可以产生一个稳定的社会，可以为大多数人创造最大的一块馅饼。作为一个附带好处，它带来了更多的增长。

Capitalism is a powerful engine of economic growth because it rewards people for investing in assets that generate value over time, which is an effective incentive system for creating and distributing technological gains. But the price of progress in capitalism is inequality.

资本主义是经济增长的强大引擎，因为它奖励投资于随着时间推移产生价值的资产的人，这是创造和分配技术收益的有效激励制度。但资本主义进步的代价是不平等。

Some inequality is ok–in fact, it’s critical, as shown by all systems that have tried to be perfectly equal–but a society that does not offer sufficient equality of opportunity for everyone to advance is not a society that will last.

一些不平等是可以的--事实上，正如所有试图完全平等的制度所表明的那样，这是至关重要的--但一个没有为每个人提供足够的机会平等来推动进步的社会，就不是一个能够持续下去的社会。

The traditional way to address inequality has been by progressively taxing income. For a variety of reasons, that hasn’t worked very well. It will work much, much worse in the future. While people will still have jobs, many of those jobs won’t be ones that create a lot of economic value in the way we think of value today. As AI produces most of the world’s basic goods and services, people will be freed up to spend more time with people they care about, care for people, appreciate art and nature, or work toward social good.

解决不平等问题的传统方法是逐步对收入征税。由于各种原因，这种做法效果不是很好。在未来，它的效果会差得多。虽然人们仍然会有工作，但其中许多工作不会像我们今天认为的那样创造大量的经济价值。随着人工智能生产世界上大多数基本商品和服务，人们将获得解放，可以花更多的时间与他们关心的人在一起，关心人们，欣赏艺术和自然，或致力于社会公益。

We should therefore focus on taxing capital rather than labor, and we should use these taxes as an opportunity to directly distribute ownership and wealth to citizens. In other words, the best way to improve capitalism is to enable everyone to benefit from it directly as an equity owner. This is not a new idea, but it will be newly feasible as AI grows more powerful, because there will be dramatically more wealth to go around. The two dominant sources of wealth will be 1) companies, particularly ones that make use of AI, and 2) land, which has a fixed supply.

因此，我们应该把重点放在对资本而不是对劳动力征税上，并应利用这些税收作为机会，将所有权和财富直接分配给公民。换句话说，改善资本主义的最佳方式是让每个人都能作为股权所有者直接从中受益。这并不是一个新想法，但随着人工智能变得更加强大，它将变得新的可行，因为将有更多的财富可供分配。财富的两个主要来源将是1)公司，特别是那些使用人工智能的公司，以及2)有固定供应的土地。

There are many ways to implement these two taxes, and many thoughts about what to do with them. Over a long period of time, perhaps most other taxes could be eliminated. What follows is an idea in the spirit of a conversation starter.

有许多方法来实施这两种税收，以及许多关于如何处理它们的想法。在很长一段时间内，也许大多数其他税收都可以取消。以下是一个发自对话启动者精神的想法。

We could do something called the American Equity Fund. The American Equity Fund would be capitalized by taxing companies above a certain valuation 2.5% of their market value each year, payable in shares transferred to the fund, and by taxing 2.5% of the value of all privately-held land, payable in dollars.

我们可以做一个叫做“美国股票基金”的项目。美国股票基金的资本化方式是，每年对估值超过其市值2.5%的公司征税，以转让给该基金的股票形式支付，并对所有私人持有的土地价值的2.5%征税，以美元支付。

All citizens over 18 would get an annual distribution, in dollars and company shares, into their accounts. People would be entrusted to use the money however they needed or wanted—for better education, healthcare, housing, starting a company, whatever. Rising costs in government-funded industries would face real pressure as more people chose their own services in a competitive marketplace.

所有18岁以上的公民都将获得以美元和公司股票形式的年度分配到他们的账户中。人们将被委托以他们需要或想要的方式使用资金--用于更好的教育、医疗保健、住房、创办公司等等。随着越来越多的人在竞争激烈的市场中选择自己的服务，政府资助行业不断上升的成本将面临真正的压力。

As long as the country keeps doing better, every citizen would get more money from the Fund every year (on average; there will still be economic cycles). Every citizen would therefore increasingly partake of the freedoms, powers, autonomies, and opportunities that come with economic self-determination. Poverty would be greatly reduced and many more people would have a shot at the life they want.

只要国家继续做得更好，每个公民每年都会从基金中获得更多的钱(平均而言，仍然会有经济周期)。因此，每个公民都将越来越多地分享经济自决带来的自由、权力、自治和机会。贫困将大大减少，更多的人将有机会过上他们想要的生活。

A tax payable in company shares will align incentives between companies, investors, and citizens, whereas a tax on profits does not–incentives are superpowers, and this is a critical difference. Corporate profits can be disguised or deferred or offshored, and are often disconnected from share price. But everyone who owns a share in Amazon wants the share price to rise. As people’s individual assets rise in tandem with the country’s, they have a literal stake in seeing their country do well.

公司股票的应税将使公司、投资者和公民之间的激励相一致，而对利润税则不会--激励是超能力，这是一个关键的区别。公司利润可以被掩盖、递延或转移到海外，而且往往与股价脱节。但每个持有亚马逊股份的人都希望股价上涨。随着人们的个人资产与国家的资产同步增长，他们看到自己的国家表现良好对他们有实际的利害关系。

Henry George, an American political economist, proposed the idea of a land-value tax in the late 1800s. The concept is widely supported by economists. The value of land appreciates because of the work society does around it: the network effects of the companies operating around a piece of land, the public transportation that makes it accessible, and the nearby restaurants, coffeeshops, and access to nature that makes it desirable. Because the landowner didn’t do all that work, it’s fair for that value to be shared with the larger society that did.

19世纪末，美国政治经济学家亨利·乔治提出了征收地价税的想法。这一概念得到了经济学家的广泛支持。土地的价值增值是因为社会在它周围所做的工作：围绕一块土地运营的公司的网络效应，使它变得容易到达的公共交通，以及附近的餐馆、咖啡馆，以及使它变得令人向往的对自然的访问。因为土地所有者没有做所有的工作，所以与做了这些工作的更大的社会分享这些价值是公平的。

If everyone owns a slice of American value creation, everyone will want America to do better: collective equity in innovation and in the success of the country will align our incentives. The new social contract will be a floor for everyone in exchange for a ceiling for no one, and a shared belief that technology can and must deliver a virtuous circle of societal wealth. (We will continue to need strong leadership from our government to make sure that the desire for stock prices to go up remains balanced with protecting the environment, human rights, etc.)

如果每个人都拥有美国价值创造的一部分，每个人都会希望美国做得更好：创新和国家成功的集体公平将与我们的激励措施保持一致。新的社会契约将是每个人的底线，以换取没有人的上限，以及一种共同的信念，即技术能够而且必须带来社会财富的良性循环。(我们将继续需要我们的政府强有力的领导，以确保股价上涨的愿望与保护环境、人权等保持平衡。)

In a world where everyone benefits from capitalism as an owner, the collective focus will be on making the world “more good” instead of “less bad.” These approaches are more different than they seem, and society does much better when it focuses on the former. Simply put, more good means optimizing for making the pie as large as possible, and less bad means dividing the pie up as fairly as possible. Both can increase people’s standard of living once, but continuous growth only happens when the pie grows.

在一个每个人都作为所有者从资本主义中受益的世界里，集体的重点将是让世界变得更好，而不是让世界变得更坏。这些方法比它们看起来的更不同，当社会专注于前者时，社会会做得更好。简单地说，更好的意味着优化使馅饼尽可能大，而更少的坏意味着尽可能公平地分配馅饼。两者都可以一次性提高人们的生活水平，但只有当蛋糕变大时，才能实现持续增长。

## Part 4 Implementation and Troubleshooting  
## 第四部分 实施和故障排除  

The amount of wealth available to capitalize the American Equity Fund would be significant. There is about $50 trillion worth of value, as measured by market capitalization, in US companies alone. Assume that, as it has on average over the past century, this will at least double over the next decade.

可用于将美国股票基金资本化的财富数量将是巨大的。以市值衡量，仅在美国公司就有大约50万亿美元的价值。假设，就像过去一个世纪的平均情况一样，未来10年，这一数字将至少翻一番。

There is also about $30 trillion worth of privately-held land in the US (not counting improvements on top of the land). Assume that this value will roughly double, too, over the next decade–this is somewhat faster than the historical rate, but as the world really starts to understand the shifts AI will cause, the value of land, as one of the few truly finite assets, should increase at a faster rate.

美国还有价值约30万亿美元的私人拥有的土地(不包括土地上的改善)。假设这一价值在未来十年也将大致翻一番--这略快于历史速度，但随着世界真正开始理解人工智能将导致的转变，作为为数不多的真正有限的资产之一，土地的价值应该会以更快的速度增长。

Of course, if we increase the tax burden on holding land, its value will diminish relative to other investment assets, which is a good thing for society because it makes a fundamental resource more accessible and encourages investment instead of speculation. The value of companies will diminish in the short-term, too, though they will continue to perform quite well over time.

当然，如果我们增加对持有土地的税收负担，其价值相对于其他投资资产将会减少，这对社会来说是一件好事，因为它使基本资源更容易获得，并鼓励投资而不是投机。公司的价值在短期内也将缩水，尽管随着时间的推移，它们将继续表现得相当好。

It’s a reasonable assumption that such a tax causes a drop in value of land and corporate assets of 15% (which only will take a few years to recover!).

合理的假设是，这样的税收会导致土地和企业资产价值下降15%(这只需要几年的时间就能恢复！)

Under the above set of assumptions (current values, future growth, and the reduction in value from the new tax), a decade from now each of the 250 million adults in America would get about $13,500 every year. That dividend could be much higher if AI accelerates growth, but even if it’s not, $13,500 will have much greater purchasing power than it does now because technology will have greatly reduced the cost of goods and services. And that effective purchasing power will go up dramatically every year.

根据上述一系列假设(当前价值、未来增长和新税带来的价值减少)，十年后，美国2.5亿成年人每人每年将获得约13,500美元。如果人工智能加速增长，这一红利可能会高得多，但即使不是这样，13,500美元也将拥有比现在更大的购买力，因为技术将大大降低商品和服务的成本。而这种有效购买力每年都会大幅上升。

It would be easiest for companies to pay the tax each year by issuing new shares representing 2.5% of their value. There would obviously be an incentive for companies to escape the American Equity Fund tax by off-shoring themselves, but a simple test involving a percentage of revenue derived from America could address this concern. A larger problem with this idea is the incentive for companies to return value to shareholders instead of reinvesting it in growth.

对于公司来说，每年通过发行相当于其价值2.5%的新股来缴纳税款将是最容易的。显然，企业有动机通过将自己外包出去来逃避美国股票基金税，但一项涉及一定比例来自美国的收入的简单测试可以解决这一担忧。这一想法的一个更大问题是，公司有动机将价值返还给股东，而不是将价值再投资于增长。

If we tax only public companies, there would also be an incentive for companies to stay private. For private companies that have annual revenue in excess of $1 billion, we could let their tax in equity accrue for a certain (limited) number of years until they go public. If they remain private for a long time, we could let them settle the tax in cash.

如果我们只对上市公司征税，也会激励公司保持私有。对于年收入超过10亿美元的私营公司，我们可以让他们的股权税在一定(有限的)年限内累加，直到它们上市。如果他们长期保持私人身份，我们可以让他们以现金支付税款。

We’d need to design the system to prevent people from consistently voting themselves more money. A constitutional amendment delineating the allowable ranges of the tax would be a strong safeguard. It is important that the tax not be so large that it stifles growth–for example, the tax on companies must be much smaller than their average growth rate.

我们需要设计这个系统，以防止人们不断地投票给自己更多的钱。一项划定税收允许范围的宪法修正案将是一个强有力的保障。重要的是，税收不能太高，以至于扼杀增长--例如，对企业征收的税收必须远远低于它们的平均增长率。

We’d also need a robust system for quantifying the actual value of land. One way would be with a corps of powerful federal assessors. Another would be to let local governments do the assessing, as they now do to determine property taxes. They would continue to receive local taxes using the same assessed value. However, if a certain percentage of sales in a jurisdiction in any given year falls too far above or below the local government’s estimate of the property’s values, then all the other properties in their jurisdiction would be reassessed up or down.

我们还需要一个强大的系统来量化土地的实际价值。一种方法是与一群强大的联邦陪审员合作。另一种办法是让地方政府进行评估，就像他们现在确定房产税一样。他们将继续使用相同的评估价值获得地方税。然而，如果某一司法管辖区某一年的销售额的某个百分比远远高于或低于当地政府对该房产价值的估计，那么该司法管辖区内的所有其他房产都将被重新评估。

The theoretically optimal system would be to tax the value of the land only, and not the improvements built on top of it. In practice, this value may turn out to be too difficult to assess, so we may need to tax the value of the land and the improvements on it (at a lower rate, as the combined value would be higher).

理论上最优的制度将是只对土地的价值征税，而不是对在其基础上建造的改善措施征税。实际上，这一价值可能难以评估，因此我们可能需要对土地及其改善工程的价值征税(税率较低，因为合并后的价值会更高)。

Finally, we couldn’t let people borrow against, sell, or otherwise pledge their future Fund distributions, or we won’t really solve the problem of fairly distributing wealth over time. The government can simply make such transactions unenforceable.

最后，我们不能让人们以未来的基金分配为抵押、出售或以其他方式质押，否则我们不会真正解决随着时间的推移公平分配财富的问题。政府可以干脆让这类交易无法执行。

## Part 5 Shifting to the New System  
## 第五部分 向新系统过渡  

A great future isn’t complicated: we need technology to create more wealth, and policy to fairly distribute it. Everything necessary will be cheap, and everyone will have enough money to be able to afford it. As this system will be enormously popular, policymakers who embrace it early will be rewarded: they will themselves become enormously popular.

一个伟大的未来并不复杂：我们需要技术来创造更多的财富，需要政策来公平分配财富。所有必需品都很便宜，每个人都有足够的钱买得起。由于这一体系将非常受欢迎，及早接受它的政策制定者将获得回报：他们自己也将变得非常受欢迎。

In the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt was able to enact a huge social safety net that no one would have thought possible five years earlier. We are in a similar moment now. So a movement that is both pro-business and pro-people will unite a remarkably broad constituency.

在大萧条时期，富兰克林·罗斯福制定了一个巨大的社会保障网络，这在五年前是没有人会想到的。我们现在正处于一个类似的时刻。因此，一场既支持商业又支持人民的运动将团结非常广泛的选民。

A politically feasible way to launch the American Equity Fund, and one that would reduce the transitional shock, would be with legislation that transitions us gradually to the 2.5% rates. The full 2.5% rate would only take hold once GDP increases by 50% from the time the law is passed. Starting with small distributions soon will be both motivating and helpful in getting people comfortable with a new future. Achieving 50% GDP growth sounds like it would take a long time (it took 13 years for the economy to grow 50% to its 2019 level). But once AI starts to arrive, growth will be extremely rapid. Down the line, we will probably be able to reduce a lot of other taxes as we tax these two fundamental asset classes.

推出美国股票基金的一种政治上可行的方式，也是一种可以减少过渡冲击的方式，就是立法逐步过渡到2.5%的利率。只有当GDP从该法律通过之日起增长50%时，2.5%的完整税率才会生效。很快从小的发行版开始，将会激励和帮助人们适应一个新的未来。实现50%的GDP增长听起来需要很长时间(经济增长50%到2019年的水平花了13年时间)。但一旦人工智能开始到来，增长将极其迅速。随着我们对这两个基本资产类别征税，我们很可能能够减少许多其他税收。

The changes coming are unstoppable. If we embrace them and plan for them, we can use them to create a much fairer, happier, and more prosperous society. The future can be almost unimaginably great.

即将到来的变化是不可阻挡的。如果我们拥抱它们并为它们做好规划，我们就可以用它们来创造一个更公平、更幸福、更繁荣的社会。未来可能几乎是难以想象的美好。
