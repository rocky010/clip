The company said the price was determined with consideration of the “clinical, societal, economic, and innovative value represented by this novel gene therapy.” Earlier last month, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a Boston-based nonprofit research institute that estimates the value of drugs and other medical services, said Hemgenix would be fairly priced at [upward of $2.9 million](https://icer.org/news-insights/press-releases/icer-publishes-evidence-report-on-gene-therapies-for-hemophilia-a-and-b/).

该公司表示，价格是在考虑“这种新型基因疗法所代表的临床、社会、经济和创新价值”的情况下确定的。 上个月早些时候，总部位于波士顿的非营利性研究机构临床和经济评论研究所估计药物和其他医疗服务的价值，称 Hemgenix [的合理定价将超过 290 万美元](https://icer.org/news-insights/press-releases/icer-publishes-evidence-report-on-gene-therapies-for-hemophilia-a-and-b/) 。

But Michael Gusmano, professor of health policy at Lehigh University and a research scholar at the Hastings Center, an independent bioethics research institute in Garrison, New York, says the price of Hemgenix and other gene therapies shouldn’t be considered a bargain. “It assumes that the price of current treatments are appropriate,” he says. “We have a system in which prices are completely out of line internationally,” noting that the US, unlike other economically developed countries, does not regulate or negotiate the prices of new drugs when they come onto the market.

但利哈伊大学卫生政策教授、纽约加里森独立生物伦理学研究所黑斯廷斯中心的研究学者迈克尔古斯马诺表示，Hemgenix 和其他基因疗法的价格不应被视为便宜货。 “它假设当前治疗的价格是合适的，”他说。 “我们有一个价格完全不符合国际标准的体系，”他指出，与其他经济发达国家不同，美国在新药上市时不会对其价格进行监管或协商。

While most patients never pay the full cost of drugs out of pocket, people who are uninsured and those with high-deductive plans may have trouble accessing these therapies. CSL Behring says it plans to offer discounts, and other makers of gene therapies have also set up patient assistance programs.  

虽然大多数患者从未自掏腰包支付全部药物费用，但没有保险的人和拥有高扣除计划的人可能难以获得这些疗法。 CSL Behring 表示，它计划提供折扣，其他基因疗法制造商也设立了患者援助计划。

In its statement to WIRED, CSL Behring said the overall effect on the health care system will be small, since hemophilia B is a rare disease affecting only about 6,000 individuals in the US. Only adults are eligible to receive Hemgenix, making the pool of potential patients even smaller. 

CSL Behring 在给《连线》杂志的声明中表示，对医疗保健系统的总体影响将很小，因为血友病 B 是一种罕见疾病，在美国仅影响约 6,000 人。 只有成年人才有资格接受 Hemgenix，这使得潜在患者群体更小。

Paulk says gene therapies are so expensive because they’re complex and costly to manufacture. “This isn’t a small molecule drug like Tylenol,” she says. “These are very different from your classic drugs you take in pill form. Those types of drugs can often be manufactured by robots, there can often be millions of doses made a day, and the process can be farmed out to third parties once you’ve got that chemical synthesis set.”

保尔克说，基因疗法之所以如此昂贵，是因为它们制造起来既复杂又昂贵。 “这不是像泰诺那样的小分子药物，”她说。 “这些与您以药丸形式服用的经典药物非常不同。 这些类型的药物通常可以由机器人制造，通常一天可以生产数百万剂，一旦你有了化学合成装置，这个过程就可以外包给第三方。”

Gene therapies are made by inactivating viruses and using them as delivery devices to shuttle therapeutic genes to patients’ cells. These viruses are grown in huge stainless steel vats and later purified and tested to make sure they’re safe and function properly. All in all, it can take 10 months or longer to make enough doses for patients in a clinical trial. 

基因疗法是通过灭活病毒并使用它们作为传递装置将治疗基因穿梭到患者细胞中来进行的。 这些病毒在巨大的不锈钢大桶中生长，然后经过纯化和测试以确保它们安全且功能正常。 总而言之，在临床试验中为患者制备足够剂量可能需要 10 个月或更长时间。

Even though these treatments have been in development for several decades, gene therapy is still very new to the market. Paulk thinks the cost of manufacturing will go down—and subsequently, so will the price of gene therapy—as companies get more experienced in making them at scale. “We will absolutely get better at this,” she says, but it could take five to 10 years for that to happen. 

尽管这些疗法已经发展了几十年，但基因疗法对市场来说仍然是一个新事物。 保尔克认为，随着公司在大规模生产方面获得更多经验，制造成本将会下降，随后基因疗法的价格也会下降。 “我们绝对会在这方面做得更好，”她说，但这可能需要 5 到 10 年的时间才能实现。

With hundreds of gene therapies in the pipeline and some of them likely to be approved in the coming years, that could mean more multimillion-dollar treatments coming onto the market. Companies are banking on these therapies working long-term, but there’s still uncertainty about how long their effects will last. Clinical trials have followed patients for years, not decades.

数百种基因疗法正在酝酿之中，其中一些可能会在未来几年获得批准，这可能意味着更多价值数百万美元的疗法将进入市场。 公司寄希望于这些疗法能长期发挥作用，但它们的效果能持续多久仍不确定。 临床试验跟踪患者多年，而不是几十年。

If they don’t last as long as hoped, Gusmano wonders what that will mean for pricing. And even if they do, he says, million-dollar price tags aren’t sustainable in the long run. “There’s no question that these gene therapies are going to be expensive,” Gusmano says. “The question is: At what level will payers start pushing back and simply refuse to cover them?”

如果它们没有像希望的那样持久，古斯马诺想知道这对定价意味着什么。 他说，即使他们这样做了，从长远来看，百万美元的价格标签也不可持续。 “毫无疑问，这些基因疗法将非常昂贵，”Gusmano 说。 “问题是：付款人会在什么水平上开始退缩并干脆拒绝承保？”
