## 一个

All around us, friendships old and new are coming to grief over politics. What is the cause of this? Part of the problem relates to how we practice politics today: we have become more warlike and tribal. Another part of the problem stems from our contemporary understanding of friendship. Genuine friendship places weighty demands on us, and most of us prefer relationships that are quicker and easier, and thus less enduring.

在我们周围，新旧友谊都因政治而破裂。 这是什么原因？ 部分问题与我们今天如何实践政治有关：我们变得更加好战和部落化。 问题的另一部分源于我们当代对友谊的理解。 真正的友谊对我们提出了沉重的要求，我们中的大多数人更喜欢更快速、更容易、因此更不持久的关系。

Politics and friendship are deeply connected. As strange as it sounds, how we understand _what_ _politics is_ has an effect on the kinds of friendships we are likely to enjoy. And, conversely, how we understand friendship will affect our practice of politics.

政治和友谊是紧密相连的。 听起来很奇怪，我们如何理解 _什么_ _政治是_ 会影响我们可能享受的友谊种类。 反过来，我们如何理解友谊会影响我们的政治实践。

What exactly is the connection between politics and friendship, and how should we assess the relative value of each when they come into conflict?

政治和友谊到底是什么关系，当它们发生冲突时，我们应该如何评估两者的相对价值？

The ancients had an important distinction between types of goods. Some goods are merely instrumental to other goods. Think of a doctor’s visit. Seeing the doctor is good, but not good in itself. Rather, it is good in relation to health.

古人对商品的种类有一个重要的区分。 有些商品仅对其他商品有用。 想想医生的访问。 看医生固然好，但本身并不好。 相反，它对健康有益。

But other goods are intrinsic, because their value lies entirely in themselves. Think of play, aesthetic delight, love, divine worship, and knowledge. These goods, especially when practiced in the company of others, bring meaning to life. They simply are what we mean by happiness—what the Greeks called _eudaimonia_. A life without these goods would be meaningless. Indeed, if one’s life were entirely focused on instrumental goods—moneymaking, the pursuit of fame, honour, tackling our to-do list, self-improvement, and social progress—without being grounded in intrinsic goods, we would be like chains suspended in midair. All our activities would constitute so many “links,” valuable for what they lead to; but the chain itself would go nowhere. This is precisely what Nietzsche meant by nihilism—not the belief that life has no meaning but the belief that a life devoted only to instrumental goods has meaning in itself.

但其他商品是内在的，因为它们的价值完全在于它们自身。 想想游戏、审美愉悦、爱、神圣崇拜和知识。 这些商品，尤其是与他人一起练习时，会给生活带来意义。 它们就是我们所说的幸福——希腊人称之为 _eudaimonia_ 。 没有这些商品的生活将毫无意义。 事实上，如果一个人的生活完全专注于工具性的善——赚钱、追求名誉、荣誉、处理我们的待办事项、自我完善和社会进步——而不以内在的善为基础，我们就会像悬挂在半空中。 我们所有的活动都将构成如此多的“链接”，因其导致的结果而有价值； 但是链条本身将无处可去。 这正是尼采所说的虚无主义的意思——不是相信生活没有意义，而是相信只献身于工具性善行的生活本身就有意义。

The distinction between instrumental and intrinsic goods is crucial, because friendship (real friendship, not the ersatz friendship we practice today) is an intrinsic good, while politics is an instrumental good. Thus, to lose a friendship over politics suggests that something is deeply disordered in our souls.

工具性善与内在善之间的区别至关重要，因为友谊（真正的友谊，而不是我们今天实践的虚假友谊）是一种内在善，而政治是一种工具性善。 因此，因政治而失去友谊表明我们的灵魂中存在某种深深的混乱。

### **Politics**

### **政治**

Politics has to be understood in two dimensions to fully appreciate its paradoxical relation to friendship. One dimension relates to its ends, the other to its means. Regarding ends, all politics is teleological, whether its ends are conservative, progressive, or some admixture of both. In a pluralist society where citizens disagree over the relative value of various ends, politics is necessarily contentious.

必须从两个维度来理解政治，才能充分理解它与友谊的矛盾关系。 一个维度与其目的相关，另一个维度与其手段相关。 关于目的，所有政治都是目的论的，无论其目的是保守的、进步的，还是两者的某种混合。 在公民对各种目的的相对价值存在分歧的多元化社会中，政治必然是有争议的。

We would prefer this were not the case. We dream of a politics that might harness the power of the collective to pursue the ends we value most. Call this the “politics of unitary vision.” We dream of a “body politic,” like the body of the church described by St. Paul, where so many diverse “members” work in perfect harmony to pursue a collective goal. The ancient Greeks with their city-states celebrated this sort of life, and the ghost of the polis still haunts us.

我们希望情况并非如此。 我们梦想一种可以利用集体力量追求我们最看重的目标的政治。 称之为“单一愿景的政治”。 我们梦想有一个“政治团体”，就像圣保罗所描述的教会团体一样，许多不同的“成员”在其中完美和谐地工作，以追求一个集体目标。 古希腊人和他们的城邦庆祝这种生活，城邦的幽灵仍然困扰着我们。

But in the modern nation-state this form of politics cannot be achieved without brutal coercion and complete disregard for human dignity—which brings us to political “means.” A tremendous shift is taking place in American politics that affects the Right and the Left alike. We seem increasingly to understand politics as a species of war. Of course, pluralist politics is necessarily contentious, but it need not be viewed as war, where the goal is the elimination of the enemy and the achievement of total control. Yet today we do view the other side as our “enemy.” We use political “tactics” and “strategies.” We seek “victory.” The Left accuses the Right of waging a war on women, while the Right blames the Left for their war on Christian values. We wage war on everything from poverty and drugs to inflation and immigration.

但在现代民族国家中，如果没有残酷的胁迫和对人的尊严的完全无视——这将我们带到政治“手段”，就无法实现这种形式的政治。 美国政治正在发生巨大的转变，对右翼和左翼都有同样的影响。 我们似乎越来越将政治理解为一种战争。 当然，多元政治必然是有争议的，但不必将其视为以消灭敌人和实现全面控制为目标的战争。 然而今天我们确实将对方视为我们的“敌人”。 我们使用政治“策略”和“策略”。 我们寻求“胜利”。 左派指责右派对女性发动战争，而右派指责左派对基督教价值观发动战争。 我们对从贫困和毒品到通货膨胀和移民的一切事物开战。

### To lose a friendship over politics suggests that something is deeply disordered in our souls.

### 因政治而失去友谊表明我们的灵魂中存在某种深深的混乱。

The paradox is not only that we desire the politics of unitary vision and end up with the politics of war. It is much deeper than that. It is that we desire a life devoted to the communal practice of intrinsic goods and end up with a life completely saturated by political instrumentality.

悖论不仅在于我们渴望单一愿景的政治，却以战争政治告终。 它比那更深。 这是因为我们渴望一种致力于内在善的公共实践的生活，而最终却过着一种完全被政治工具浸透的生活。

Imagine, by analogy, a virtuoso pianist at the peak of her career who looks out at the culture around her and realizes that appreciation for classical music is rapidly fading. She senses a crisis: if things continue, there will soon be no audiences, no careers in music, and no future great performances. She considers the situation so dire that she decides to step away from her instrument, if only for a time, in order to defend classical music nationwide. She gives speeches about composers in grade schools across the country, lobbies Congress for increased support for the arts, and solicits wealthy donors to sponsor classical-music instruction. Her work is noble, but it consumes her; and the crisis is so severe that her task is never done. Thus, she never fully returns to the life of music she enjoyed before. Now, when she has time to play, which is rare, she’s a shadow of her former self. Practice sessions find her distracted. Her music suffers as a result of her effort to save music.

以此类推，想象一下，一位处于职业生涯顶峰的钢琴演奏家审视了她周围的文化，并意识到对古典音乐的欣赏正在迅速消退。 她感觉到了危机：再这样下去，很快就会没有观众，没有音乐事业，也没有未来的精彩演出。 她认为形势如此严峻，以至于她决定暂时离开她的乐器，以在全国范围内捍卫古典音乐。 她在全国各地的小学发表关于作曲家的演讲，游说国会增加对艺术的支持，并征求富有的捐助者赞助古典音乐教学。 她的工作是崇高的，但它消耗了她； 危机如此严重，她的任务从未完成。 因此，她再也没有完全回到她以前喜欢的音乐生活中。 现在，当她有时间玩耍时（这种情况很少见），她就成了以前的自己的影子。 练习课让她分心。 由于她努力拯救音乐，她的音乐受到了影响。

The battle to save music is not itself the practice of music. The two activities are worlds apart. One is an instrumental good, the other intrinsic; one is never complete, the other complete in itself. This paradox occurs across domains: The battle to preserve a space for Christian worship in an increasingly secular society is not itself Christian worship. The defence of the liberal arts is not the liberal arts. And the war to save our political union from our enemies is not itself political union.

拯救音乐的战斗本身并不是音乐的实践。 这两项活动是天壤之别。 一个是工具性的，另一个是内在的； 一个永远不完整，另一个本身就是完整的。 这种悖论发生在各个领域：在日益世俗的社会中为基督教崇拜保留空间的斗争本身并不是基督教崇拜。 为文科辩护的不是文科。 从敌人手中拯救我们的政治联盟的战争本身并不是政治联盟。

Two conclusions follow. First, there must be an activity of “politics” that is different from war. This is what the analogy from other domains implies. But what is that activity? The answer must be communal living itself. Or, as the early modern Dutch philosopher Johannes Althusius (1563–1638) once put it, “Politics is the art of associating men for the purpose of establishing, cultivating, and conserving social life among them.” Politics, in other words, is essentially about communion. So while politics is itself an instrumental good, when it is practiced well it is an instrumental good in the immediate service of an intrinsic good: togetherness.

有两个结论。 首先，必须有一种不同于战争的“政治”活动。 这是其他领域的类比所暗示的。 但是那个活动是什么？ 答案必须是共同生活本身。 或者，正如早期现代荷兰哲学家约翰内斯·阿尔图西乌斯（Johannes Althusius，1563-1638 年）曾经说过的那样，“政治是将人们联合起来以在他们之间建立、培养和维护社会生活的艺术。” 换句话说，政治本质上是关于交流的。 因此，虽然政治本身是一种工具性善，但如果实践得当，它也是一种工具性善，可以直接服务于内在利益：团结。

The second conclusion is this: mistaking political battle for politics itself causes severe harm to human fulfillment. Some people dismiss this harm on the grounds that politics has simply always been as nasty as it is now. In their defence they cite the extreme vitriol exchanged between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams in the election of 1800. But they are wrong. While the vitriol was indeed extreme, what they miss is that the massive increase in the scope of government since 1800 means that all domains of social life are now conscripted into political warfare: education becomes political; church becomes political; museums and orchestras become political. Everything is valued, or not, depending on its potential contribution to victory.

第二个结论是：将政治斗争误认为是政治本身会对人类的成就感造成严重伤害。 有些人以政治一向像现在这样令人讨厌为由对这种危害不屑一顾。 在他们的辩护中，他们引用了托马斯杰斐逊和约翰亚当斯在 1800 年大选中的极端尖酸刻薄。但他们错了。 虽然尖酸刻薄确实是极端的，但他们忽略的是，自 1800 年以来政府范围的大幅扩大意味着社会生活的所有领域现在都被征召入政治战争：教育变得政治化； 教会变得政治化； 博物馆和管弦乐队变得政治化。 一切都被重视或不被重视，取决于它对胜利的潜在贡献。

When this happens, the stakes are immeasurably higher. To the extent that government is now involved in so many aspects of our lives, the ability to control it is politically imperative. No one can afford to lose. And this causes everything to rachet up. War becomes “total war.”

发生这种情况时，赌注高得无法估量。 就政府现在涉及我们生活的许多方面而言，控制它的能力在政治上势在必行。 没有人能输得起。 这导致一切都变得棘手。 战争变成了“全面战争”。

C.S. Lewis once pointed out in his famous sermon “Learning in War-Time” that the mentality of war not only leads us to instrumentalize all goods that are useful for victory but also creates an atmosphere of shame for individuals who try to engage in intrinsic goods while the war is on. Learning for its own sake is deemed an inexcusable luxury. Even human beings are reconceived in terms of their usefulness, or not, to the cause.

CS Lewis 曾在其著名的“战时学习”布道中指出，战争心态不仅导致我们将所有对胜利有用的商品都工具化，而且还为试图从事内在商品的个人营造了一种耻辱的氛围战争还在继续。 为了学习而学习被认为是一种不可原谅的奢侈。 甚至人类也会根据他们对事业的有用性或无用性来重新认识。

This brings us to the effect of politics on friendship. When politics is understood as war, genuine friendship becomes difficult because friendship contributes nothing to the cause. What it is replaced with is “allyship” or “comradeship.” And comrades are not, strictly speaking, friends. They are rather partners in a cause.

这给我们带来了政治对友谊的影响。 当政治被理解为战争时，真正的友谊就变得困难，因为友谊对事业毫无贡献。 取而代之的是“allyship”或“comradeship”。 而同志严格来说也算不上朋友。 他们更像是事业的伙伴。

### When politics is understood as war, genuine friendship becomes difficult because friendship contributes nothing to the cause.

### 当政治被理解为战争时，真正的友谊就变得困难，因为友谊对事业毫无贡献。

[Cancel culture](https://comment.org/the-pharisee-on-social-media/) is perfectly explainable in this light. It has arisen precisely because we have come to value our fellow citizens only for the contributions they might make to political victory. Being cancelled is so painful because it delivers the revelation that what we supposed to be deep relationships of mutual admiration and respect—intrinsic goods—were in fact shallow relationships of instrumentality. Allies “use” each other, and any respect or admiration that may accrue over time will always be subordinate to the ends for which they are used.

[从这个角度来看，取消文化](https://comment.org/the-pharisee-on-social-media/) 是完全可以解释的。 它的出现正是因为我们开始重视我们的同胞，只是因为他们可能为政治胜利做出的贡献。 被取消是如此痛苦，因为它揭示了我们本应是相互钦佩和尊重的深层关系——内在的好处——实际上是肤浅的工具性关系。 盟友相互“使用”，随着时间的推移可能产生的任何尊重或钦佩将始终从属于使用它们的目的。

Finally, a culture that views politics as war will inevitably struggle with meaninglessness. Of course, there is some sense of meaning in fighting for a cause. But in pluralist societies like ours, political causes will _never_ be fully achieved, not only because there is no place to dispose permanently of our enemies—every victory is thus subject to reversal over time—but also because what the “warmakers” are ultimately seeking in politics is a resolution possible only on the far side of the eschaton. We are seeking perfect justice, perfect agreement, and perfect stability over time. Because perfection in this world constantly eludes us, politics is like that chain suspended in midair. Each link seems meaningful, but the chain is anchored in nothing. The war to end all wars has no end. What ends is only our healthy relationship to intrinsic goods that bring happiness and meaning to life.

最后，一种将政治视为战争的文化将不可避免地与无意义作斗争。 当然，为一项事业而战是有一定意义的。 但在像我们这样的多元化社会中，政治事业 _永远不会_ 完全实现，这不仅是因为没有地方可以永久消灭我们的敌人——因此，每一次胜利都会随着时间的推移而逆转——而且还因为“战争制造者”最终寻求的是什么在政治上，解决方案只有在末世的另一端才有可能。 随着时间的推移，我们正在寻求完美的正义、完美的协议和完美的稳定。 因为这个世界的完美总是离我们而去，所以政治就像悬在半空中的锁链。 每个环节似乎都有意义，但这条链条却毫无锚定。 结束所有战争的战争没有尽头。 结束的只是我们与为生活带来幸福和意义的内在商品的健康关系。

### **Friendship**

### **友谊**

Besides mistaking friendship for allyship, people today also mistake it for “companionship,” a much easier and less rewarding form of association than true friendship. Companionship involves interacting with people because they’re pleasant to be around. It typically requires proximity, an openness to self-disclosure, and free time. Companions will be seen laughing, commiserating, playing, and engaging in various activities together. But they will demand little of each other, since that is not what the relationship is for. When companions move away, the relationship typically ends. When companions become needy or burdensome, resentment quickly sets in.

除了将友谊误认为盟友关系外，今天的人们还将其误认为是“伙伴关系”，这是一种比真正的友谊更容易、回报更少的交往形式。 陪伴涉及与人互动，因为他们很乐意待在身边。 它通常需要亲近、对自我表露的开放态度和空闲时间。 同伴们会一起笑、同情、玩耍和参与各种活动。 但他们对彼此的要求很少，因为这不是关系的目的。 当同伴离开时，这种关系通常会结束。 当同伴变得有需要或成为负担时，怨恨很快就会出现。

What, then, is friendship? My colleague Alan Jacobs, whose essay of twenty years ago “[Friendship and Its Discontents](https://www.firstthings.com/article/1992/12/friendship-and-its-discontents)” is still worth reading, defines friendship as a much deeper form of emotional attachment than mere companionship. In fact, it is a form of love. One can recognize it by two tests.

那么，什么是友情呢？ 我的同事艾伦·雅各布斯 (Alan Jacobs) 二十年前的文章“ [友谊及其不满](https://www.firstthings.com/article/1992/12/friendship-and-its-discontents) ”仍然值得一读，他将友谊定义为一种比单纯的陪伴更深刻的情感依恋形式。 事实上，这是爱的一种形式。 人们可以通过两次测试来识别它。

First, who do you know, other than members of your immediate family, whose death would utterly devastate you, leaving you emotionally in a state like that of young Augustine in the _Confessions_ when he loses his closest friend? “My heart was darkened over with sorrow,” writes Augustine, “and whatever I looked at was death.” This is a somewhat morbid test, I acknowledge. But it definitely focuses the mind. Are there people with whom you have identified so deeply that without them you cannot imagine how you would carry on? Those would be friends.

首先，除了您的直系亲属，您认识谁，谁的死会彻底摧毁您，使您在情感上处于一种状态，就像《 _忏悔录_ 》中年轻的奥古斯丁失去最亲密的朋友时一样？ “我的心被悲伤笼罩，”奥古斯丁写道，“无论我看到什么，都是死亡。” 这是一个有点病态的测试，我承认。 但它确实集中了思想。 是否有一些人你已经深深认同，没有他们你无法想象你将如何继续下去？ 那些会是朋友。

The second test is less dark but similarly revealing. Who, other than family, stands in relation to you such that when he or she is not doing well, you cannot possibly be doing well either? If your friend is in the hospital, you wish to be there too. If your friend is upset over something, you find yourself distracted and upset. This test also reveals who your friends are.

第二个测试不那么黑暗，但同样具有启发性。 除了家人之外，还有谁与你的关系如此之好，以至于当他或她过得不好时，你也不可能过得好？ 如果您的朋友在医院里，您也希望在那里。 如果你的朋友因为某事而心烦意乱，你会发现自己心烦意乱。 该测试还揭示了您的朋友是谁。

Here we can see exactly what has gone wrong in our contemporary practice of friendship (i.e., companionship). In an age obsessed with individual freedom and autonomy, we have become less willing to engage in activities that place involuntary constraints on us. And friendship, like marriage, and procreation, is one of those activities that places constraints on us. Not only does friendship constrain our time; it also constrains our character insofar as it depends on virtues whose standards we do not ourselves create. Genuine friendship requires patience, forgiveness, toleration, constancy, honesty, self-sacrifice, humility, and care. These are not qualities with which one is simply born. They require cultivation and intentional effort.

在这里，我们可以确切地看到我们当代的友谊实践（即陪伴）出了什么问题。 在一个痴迷于个人自由和自主的时代，我们越来越不愿意从事对我们施加非自愿约束的活动。 友谊就像婚姻和生育一样，是对我们施加限制的活动之一。 友谊不仅限制了我们的时间； 它也限制了我们的性格，因为它取决于我们自己没有创造标准的美德。 真正的友谊需要耐心、宽恕、宽容、坚定、诚实、自我牺牲、谦逊和关怀。 这些不是一个人与生俱来的品质。 他们需要培养和有意识的努力。

Not only does friendship depend on virtue; it arguably is a virtue itself. Aristotle, for his part, hedged on this point in the _Nicomachean_ _Ethics_, claiming that friendship “is a virtue or implies virtue.” But if friendship is a virtue, this would explain why it is simultaneously so difficult and rewarding. The difficulty lies in the fact that virtues are innate capacities that can only be actualized through long practice. One cannot simply wish friendship into being or master it in a single act.

友情不仅靠德行； 可以说，它本身就是一种美德。 就亚里士多德而言，他在尼各马可伦理学中对这一点进行了 _回避_ _，_ 声称友谊“是一种美德或暗示美德”。 但如果友谊是一种美德，这就可以解释为什么它既如此困难又如此有益。 困难在于美德是先天的能力，只有通过长期的实践才能实现。 一个人不能简单地希望友谊成为现实或一蹴而就。

### Love and friendship do not emerge out of nowhere; neither do they easily pass away.

### 爱情和友谊不会凭空出现； 他们也不会轻易逝去。

In a sense, this is great news for married people, just as it is great news for friends. Marital love, like friendship, is formed gradually over the course of engaging in it. It does not depend essentially on initial emotions. Certainly, both marital love and friendship involve deep emotions, but these stem less from first encounters than from the buildup of affection over time. Love and friendship do not emerge out of nowhere; neither do they easily pass away.

从某种意义上说，这对已婚人士来说是个好消息，就像对朋友来说是个好消息一样。 夫妻之爱，同友情一样，是在交往的过程中逐渐形成的。 它本质上并不取决于最初的情绪。 诚然，夫妻之爱和友情都包含着深刻的情感，但这些情感与其说源于初次相遇，不如说源于感情随着时间的推移而积累。 爱情和友谊不会凭空出现； 他们也不会轻易逝去。

Our contemporary inability to practice genuine friendship is a catastrophe from an ethical point of view. That is because friendship is one of the few activities that can address (at least to some extent) our natural feelings of incompleteness. Friendship completes our being in two ways. The first is basically Aristotelian. As humans we are bundles of capacities waiting to be actualized. Our best capacities (the virtues) are intrinsically fulfilling to actualize. In this context, friendship is something of a peak virtue: it involves the actualization of other virtues but is also pleasing to actualize itself. Friendship is virtue turned outward and related to another who is capable of knowing and being known. In Aristotle’s view we were simply built for this: the actualization of friendship is happiness itself.

从伦理的角度来看，我们当代无法实践真正的友谊是一场灾难。 那是因为友谊是为数不多的可以解决（至少在某种程度上）我们天生的不完整感的活动之一。 友谊以两种方式完善我们的存在。 第一个基本上是亚里士多德式的。 作为人类，我们是一堆等待实现的能力。 我们最好的能力（美德）本质上是实现的。 在这种情况下，友谊是一种最高美德：它涉及其他美德的实现，但也很高兴实现自己。 友谊是外在的美德，与另一个能够认识和被认识的人相关联。 在亚里士多德看来，我们只是为此而生：友谊的实现本身就是幸福。

But there is also a more phenomenological way in which friendship completes our being, an insight I owe to conversations with my friend Molly McGrath. We human beings desire deeply to be seen and valued, and we live in profound fear of being existentially alone. But who can really know us? Who can possibly value us like we desire to be valued? How can the ontological chasm that separates one human consciousness from another ever be satisfactorily crossed?

但是，还有一种更现象学的方式可以让友谊使我们的存在变得完整，这是我与朋友莫莉·麦格拉思 (Molly McGrath) 交谈时得出的见解。 我们人类深深地渴望被人看到和重视，我们生活在对孤独存在的深深恐惧中。 但谁能真正了解我们呢？ 谁能像我们希望被重视那样重视我们？ 如何才能令人满意地跨越将一种人类意识与另一种人类意识分开的本体论鸿沟？

Somehow, friendship _is_ the crossing of that chasm. It involves deep recognition and appreciation. In friendship a self becomes intrinsically invested in another self as if the chasm were not there. In this way, too, friendship completes our being, completes our self.

不知何故，友谊 _就是_ 跨越那道鸿沟。 它涉及深刻的认识和欣赏。 在友谊中，一个自我本能地投入到另一个自我中，就好像鸿沟不存在一样。 友谊也以这种方式完善了我们的存在，完善了我们的自我。

Of course, in truth, even the richest experiences of friendship do not completely satisfy our desire to love and be loved. That desire craves more than any finite, impermanent human being can satisfy. But perhaps a final benefit of friendship is that it models for us, albeit imperfectly, something of what complete love and perfect communion might look like. Through its intrinsic goodness, its completeness in itself, and yet its ultimate incompleteness as a full satisfaction of our desire to be loved, friendship points beyond itself to something that transcends finitude and impermanence—our friendship with a loving God.

当然，事实上，即使是最丰富的友谊也不能完全满足我们爱与被爱的愿望。 这种欲望比任何有限、无常的人都无法满足。 但也许友谊的最后一个好处是它为我们塑造了完美的爱情和完美的交流可能看起来的样子，尽管不完美。 通过其内在的善良，它本身的完整性，以及作为对我们被爱欲望的完全满足的最终不完整，友谊超越了自身，指向了某种超越有限和无常的东西——我们与慈爱的上帝的友谊。

Some people I know worry that genuine friendship is less possible in a pluralist age than in contexts where citizens share a robust conception of the good, or of God. But this is not my view. From experience I have learned that friendship does not require that friends love all the same things, much less that they love the same ultimate things. Friendships based on such common loves of course _do_ exist, and perhaps they are of a higher order than those in which ultimate truths are not shared. But friendship is possible where what is loved is simply the _person_, not the person’s metaphysics or theology. Pluralism thus need not be the death of friendships that are genuine and deep.

我认识的一些人担心，真正的友谊在多元化时代比在公民对善或上帝有强烈观念的情况下更不可能。 但这不是我的观点。 我从经验中了解到，友谊并不要求朋友们都热爱同样的事物，更不用说他们热爱同样终极的事物了。 基于这种共同爱好的友谊当然 _是_ 存在的，也许它们比那些不分享终极真理的友谊更高阶。 那么友谊是可能 _但是，如果所爱的仅仅是人_ ，而不是人的形而上学或神学， 的。 因此，多元主义不一定是真正和深厚的友谊的消亡。

But if pluralism does not render meaningful friendships impossible, the tendency to understand politics as a form of war certainly makes them less likely. That was the claim I supported above by distinguishing between friendship and allyship. The second claim I made was that how one understands friendship can affect how one practices politics. Why would this be so? It is because the experience of genuine friendship, which is not merely an intrinsic good but a peak intrinsic good, cannot help but put politics in its place. Politics today makes great claims about its own importance. Yet politics cannot bring meaning to our lives—not deep meaning at any rate—because it is never more than an instrumental good.

但是，如果多元主义不会使有意义的友谊变得不可能，那么将政治理解为一种战争形式的倾向肯定会降低这种友谊的可能性。 这就是我在上面通过区分友谊和盟友来支持的主张。 我提出的第二个主张是，一个人如何理解友谊会影响一个人如何实践政治。 为什么会这样？ 这是因为真正的友谊的体验，不仅是一种内在的善，而且是一种最高的内在善，不能不把政治置于其位。 今天的政治对其自身的重要性提出了很大的要求。 然而，政治不能给我们的生活带来意义——无论如何都不能带来深刻的意义——因为它只不过是一种工具性的善。

Politics is also always incomplete, while friendship is complete in itself, in that it needs nothing else to deliver such satisfaction as is possible here on earth. Of course, friendship is incomplete in its own way, in that it cannot make us perfectly whole. But this incompleteness differs in kind from the incompleteness of politics. Politics is incomplete because its work is never done. Friendship is incomplete only insofar as its complete success intimates something even higher, a kind of friendship with God that awaits us at the end of time. Those who understand what real friendship is, and what it ultimately foreshadows, will place less value in politics because they will have better things to do. They will know through experience where their deepest longings are most fully satisfied.

政治也总是不完整的，而友谊本身就是完整的，因为它不需要其他任何东西来提供地球上可能存在的满足感。 当然，友谊以其自身的方式是不完整的，因为它不能使我们完全完整。 但这种不完整与政治的不完整在本质上是不同的。 政治是不完整的，因为它的工作从未完成。 只有当友谊的完全成功预示着更高的东西，一种在时间的尽头等待着我们的与上帝的友谊时，友谊才是不完整的。 那些了解什么是真正的友谊，以及它最终预示着什么的人，将不太重视政治，因为他们会有更好的事情要做。 他们会通过经验知道他们最深切的渴望在什么地方最能得到满足。
